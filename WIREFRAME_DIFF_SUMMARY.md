## ➕ NEW SECTION: future_discipline/README.md

**Added ~200 lines** containing complete future_discipline component documentation:

```markdown
## FILE: future_discipline/README.md

**Path:** `future_discipline/README.md`

### 1. Overview

**Purpose:** Experimental investigations into AI discipline and architectural solutions

This component documents lessons learned from Phase 4B-2 participant reconciliation 
(650+ participants, 11 batches) and proposes architectural approaches to address 
systematic AI discipline challenges.

**Status:** 🔬 Experimental / Future Investigation

**What this contains:**
- Analysis of AI discipline failures during Phase 4B-2
- Patterns of failure (premature stopping, incomplete checking, memory loss)
- Proposed "drone architecture" solution (mechanical tasks → scripts, judgment → AI)
- Comparison with mcp-agent framework approach
- Not active development - lessons learned and proposals for future consideration

### 2. Orientation - Where to Find What

**You are at:** Future discipline experiments directory

**Use this when:**
- Designing AI-human collaboration workflows
- Investigating AI reliability challenges
- Understanding Phase 4B-2 lessons learned
- Considering architectural solutions for AI discipline

### 3. Principles

**System-wide:** See [/WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md](WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md)

**Discipline-specific insights:**

**1. Scripts Are More Disciplined Than AI**
- Scripts execute mechanically (always check all 6 tools)
- AI gets lazy, forgets steps, takes shortcuts
- Use scripts for discipline, AI for judgment

**2. Context Resets Are The Problem**
- "Indy" asked about 5+ times despite resolution in past batches
- AI memory doesn't persist across sessions
- Solution: Scripts that check past decisions (persistence via files, not memory)

[... continues with full 4-section structure ...]

### 4. Specialized Topics

#### Reflections on Discipline
[24KB analysis document]

#### Drone Architecture Proposal
[17KB architectural proposal]

#### Relationship to Phase 4B-2
[Context and learnings]

#### Current Status
[Implementation status]

## 🔢 Statistics

**Sections Modified:** 8 major sections
- Root README
- CONTEXT_RECOVERY
- FathomInventory/README
- FathomInventory/CONTEXT_RECOVERY
- integration_scripts/README
- File trees (3 locations)
- Success metrics
- Quick Context Questions

**Sections Added:** 1 major section
- future_discipline/README (complete component)

**Update Pattern:**
- All "87%" → "100% complete" or specific completion status
- All "409 enriched" → "459 validated"
- All "8 rounds" → "11 batches"
- All "1,953 participants" → "682 participants" (database continued growing)
- All "255 remaining" → "223 new/unprocessed" (new context)

**Consistency:** All 30+ references updated uniformly across the wireframe

---

## ✅ Validation

**Tests Applied:**
- ✅ No "87%" remains in production docs (verified with grep)
- ✅ All participant counts consistent
- ✅ All dates updated to Oct 23-24, 2025
- ✅ future_discipline section follows 4-section structure
- ✅ All cross-references updated
- ✅ Navigation integrity maintained
