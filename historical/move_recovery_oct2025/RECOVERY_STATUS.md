**Date:** Oct 18, 2025 11:10 AM  
**Status:** ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - Monitor script has wrong path to run_all.sh

---

## Completed Steps

### ✅ Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues
- [x] **Updated `run_all.sh` venv paths** (lines 70, 82)
  - Changed from `/Users/admin/FathomInventory_venv` 
  - To: `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin_venv`
  
- [x] **Updated launchd plist** log paths
  - Changed from `/Users/admin/FathomInventory/logs/fathom_run.log`
  - To: `/Users/admin/Library/Logs/fathom_run.log`
  
- [x] **Reloaded launchd configs**
  - Unloaded and reloaded `com.era.admin.fathom.run.plist`
  - Verified service is loaded

- [x] **Created test suite** in `ERA_Admin/tests/`
  - `test_venv.py` - Virtual environment tests
  - `test_fathom_paths.py` - Path accessibility tests
  - `test_era_config.py` - Configuration tests
  - `test_component_tests.py` - Component test runner
  - `test_all.py` - Full system test runner

- [x] **Installed missing dependencies** in venv
  - playwright
  - beautifulsoup4
  - chromium browser

- [x] **Component tests passed**
  - All 3 component tests: ✅ PASS

### ✅ Phase 2: Fix Manual Tools  
- [x] **Updated `refresh_fathom_auth.sh`** venv path (line 15)
  - Changed from `${PROJECT_ROOT}/venv/bin/python3`
  - To: `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin_venv/bin/python3`

## Critical Finding (11:04 AM)

### ✅ Manual Execution WORKS
```bash
sudo -u admin bash /Users/admin/.local/bin/run_fathom_daily.sh
```
- Script starts successfully
- Venv activates correctly
- run_daily_share.py completes
- System is functioning

### ❌ Launchd Execution FAILS
- Monitor shows "crashed immediately" every 30 minutes
- Same errors after our fixes
- Difference: launchd context vs manual user context

### Root Cause IDENTIFIED (11:10 AM)

**The issue is NOT:**
- ❌ Venv paths (fixed and working)
- ❌ Dropbox access issues (manual execution from same paths works)
- ❌ Launchd security context (can access Dropbox when paths are correct)

**The issue IS:**
✅ **Monitor script path bug** in `scripts/monitor_fathom.sh` line 68

```bash
# Current (BROKEN):
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"  # = .../scripts/
nohup "$SCRIPT_DIR/run_all.sh" >> ...  # Tries to run scripts/run_all.sh (doesn't exist!)

# Should be:
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"  # = .../FathomInventory/
nohup "$PROJECT_ROOT/run_all.sh" >> ...  # Correctly runs FathomInventory/run_all.sh
```

**Why manual works but launchd fails:**
- **Manual:** Uses wrapper → cd's to FathomInventory → runs `./run_all.sh` ✅
- **Launchd:** Uses monitor → tries to run `scripts/run_all.sh` → file not found → crash ❌

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Fix Monitor Script Path Bug

**Required Fix:**
1. Update `scripts/monitor_fathom.sh` to use PROJECT_ROOT instead of SCRIPT_DIR
2. Test monitor script can find run_all.sh
3. Test launchd execution with fixed monitor

**Optional Enhancement:**
- Add Dropbox-ready check to wrapper (created as run_fathom_daily_v2.sh)
- Use as additional safety but not required for fix

```
✅ PASS: test_venv.py
✅ PASS: test_fathom_paths.py  
✅ PASS: test_era_config.py
```

**Status:** All component tests passed - ready for full system test
