REFERENCE MODEL - DO NOT EDIT

Sanitize cookies for Playwright compatibility.

SOURCE: /Users/admin/ERA_Admin/FathomInventory/sanitize_cookies.py
PROVEN: Production use in FathomInventory since October 2025
STATUS: Stable reference implementation

TO USE:
1. Copy this file to your project
2. Adapt input/output filenames as needed
3. Keep sanitization logic intact

USAGE:
    python sanitize_cookies.py

PURPOSE:
Fixes common cookie format issues that prevent Playwright from loading cookies:
- Invalid sameSite values (must be Strict, Lax, or None)
- Malformed partitionKey fields (Playwright doesn't support objects)

WHEN TO USE:
- After exporting cookies from browser
- Before loading cookies into Playwright
- When seeing cookie validation errors
