# ERA_Admin Monorepo Consolidation

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Done

Consolidated ERA_Admin into a true monorepo by absorbing FathomInventory as a regular directory.

### Before:
```
ERA_Admin/
├── .git/                    # Monorepo git
├── FathomInventory/
│   └── .git/               # Separate git! (submodule-like)
├── airtable/               # Part of monorepo
└── integration_scripts/    # Part of monorepo
```

### After:
```
ERA_Admin/
├── .git/                    # Single monorepo git
├── FathomInventory/         # Regular directory (242 files)
│   └── .git.backup/        # Backup of old git
├── airtable/
└── integration_scripts/
```

---

## Changes Made

1. **Removed wrong remote** from ERA_Admin (was accidentally pointing to FathomInventory repo)

2. **Backed up FathomInventory/.git** to `.git.backup` (safety)

3. **Removed submodule reference** (`git rm --cached FathomInventory`)

4. **Removed FathomInventory/.git** (no longer separate repo)

5. **Added all 242 FathomInventory files** directly to monorepo

6. **Kept upstream reference** (`fathom-upstream` remote for history access)

---

## Impact

### ✅ What Changed:
- Version control structure (now single .git)
- FathomInventory is regular directory, not submodule

### ✅ What Stayed the Same:
- All file paths: `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/FathomInventory/*`
- All code, scripts, databases
- Launchd automation (points to same location)
- Configuration (era_config.py)
- **Everything functional - verified** ✓

---

## History Preservation

**Old FathomInventory repository:**
- Location: `https://github.com/jonschull/ERA_fathom_inventory`
- Status: Remains on GitHub with full history
- Next step: Will be archived with note about migration

**Backup:**
- Local backup at: `FathomInventory/.git.backup/`
- Can be restored if needed

**Access to history:**
- Remote `fathom-upstream` added for reference
- Can access old commits: `git log fathom-upstream/main`

---

## Verification

```bash
# All paths still work
python3 era_config.py
# Output: ✅ All paths verified

# FathomInventory files present
ls FathomInventory/
# All files present and accessible

# No more nested .git
ls -la FathomInventory/.git
# Does not exist (only .git.backup)
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub repository** for ERA_Admin monorepo
   - Repository: `jonschull/ERA_Admin` (new)
   - Push consolidated monorepo

2. **Archive old FathomInventory repo**
   - Add README: "Moved to ERA_Admin monorepo as of Oct 2025"
   - Mark as archived on GitHub
   - Close PR #21 with note about migration

3. **Update branch/PR workflow**
   - Follow WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md protocol
   - All future work on feature branches
   - PRs to main for review

---

## Benefits

✅ **Single backup location** - Insurance against computer failure  
✅ **Simpler workflow** - One repo to manage  
✅ **Atomic commits** - Cross-component changes in single commit  
✅ **Component independence maintained** - Clear directory boundaries  
✅ **History preserved** - Old repo + backup + remote reference  
✅ **No functionality impact** - Everything works as before
