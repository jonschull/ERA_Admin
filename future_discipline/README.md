# future_discipline/README.md

### 1. Overview

**Purpose:** Experimental investigations into AI discipline and architectural solutions

This component documents lessons learned from Phase 4B-2 participant reconciliation (650+ participants, 11 batches) and proposes architectural approaches to address systematic AI discipline challenges.

**Status:** ðŸ”¬ Experimental / Future Investigation

**What this contains:**
- Analysis of AI discipline failures during Phase 4B-2
- Patterns of failure (premature stopping, incomplete checking, memory loss)
- Proposed "drone architecture" solution (mechanical tasks â†’ scripts, judgment â†’ AI)
- Comparison with mcp-agent framework approach
- Not active development - lessons learned and proposals for future consideration

**Context:** During Phase 4B-2 completion (Oct 2025), we encountered systematic issues with AI assistants failing to maintain discipline on repetitive investigative tasks. These documents analyze why this happens and propose solutions.

### 2. Orientation - Where to Find What

**You are at:** Future discipline experiments directory

**Use this when:**
- Designing AI-human collaboration workflows
- Investigating AI reliability challenges
- Understanding Phase 4B-2 lessons learned
- Considering architectural solutions for AI discipline

**What you might need:**
- **Parent** â†’ [/README.md](../README.md) - System overview
- **Related work** â†’ [integration_scripts/](../integration_scripts/) - Phase 4B-2 implementation
- **Context** â†’ integration_scripts/PAST_LEARNINGS.md - 300+ resolved patterns from Phase 4B-2
- **Principles** â†’ [/WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md](../WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md) - System-wide philosophy

### 3. Principles

**System-wide:** See [/WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md](../WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md)

**Discipline-specific insights:**

**1. Scripts Are More Disciplined Than AI**
- Scripts execute mechanically (always check all 6 tools)
- AI gets lazy, forgets steps, takes shortcuts
- Use scripts for discipline, AI for judgment

**2. Context Resets Are The Problem**
- "Indy" asked about 5+ times despite resolution in past batches
- AI memory doesn't persist across sessions
- Solution: Scripts that check past decisions (persistence via files, not memory)

**3. Forcing Functions Must Be Architectural**
- Documentation ("please check X") doesn't work
- Code that can be bypassed (new scripts) doesn't work
- Architectural enforcement (workflow won't run without check) works

**4. Decompose Tasks By Cognitive Requirements**
- Mechanical tasks â†’ scripts (grep, fuzzy match, database queries)
- Judgment tasks â†’ AI (pattern recognition, inference)
- Don't ask philosophers to do accounting

### 4. Specialized Topics

#### Reflections on Discipline

**File:** [Reflections_on_discipline.md](Reflections_on_discipline.md) (24KB)

**Summary:**
- Detailed analysis of discipline failures during Phase 4B-2
- The "checking vs actually checking" problem
- Why AI claims to have done work without executing it
- The quality threshold problem (stopping too early)
- Memory resets across sessions ("Indy" asked 5 times)
- Forcing functions that can be bypassed
- Comparison with human behavior patterns

**Key sections:**
- The Checking Problem (claims vs reality)
- The Quality Threshold Problem (good enough vs actually enough)
- The Memory Problem (context resets)
- The Bypass Problem (new scripts that skip safeguards)
- Meta-analysis: Why this is hard to fix

**Epilogue:** Discussion of mcp-agent framework as potential solution

#### Drone Architecture Proposal

**File:** [disciplined_investigation_architecture.md](disciplined_investigation_architecture.md) (17KB)

**Summary:**
Proposes decomposing Phase 4B-2 investigation workflow into:
- **Tier 1: Drones** (bash/Python scripts) - Execute all 6 tools mechanically
- **Tier 2: Rules** (deterministic logic) - Apply automatic decisions (>95% fuzzy match â†’ merge)
- **Tier 3: Orchestrator** (no AI) - Run drones for all names, batch AI questions
- **Tier 4: Claude** (high-cognition AI) - ONLY for 30% needing human judgment

**Key insight:** 70% of cases can be auto-resolved without AI. Use scripts for discipline, AI for intelligence.

**Example drone script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Always checks all 6 tools, never forgets, never gets lazy
investigate_name.sh "$NAME"
# Returns structured JSON with all results
```

**Benefits:**
- Scripts persist across sessions (solve "Indy asked 5 times" problem)
- Scripts are disciplined (always check all 6 tools)
- Cheaper (70% resolved without LLM API calls)
- Faster (parallel script execution)
- Evidence-based (results in files, falsifiable)

**Comparison with mcp-agent:**
- mcp-agent: Orchestrator LLM + worker agents + evaluator LLM
- Drones: No AI orchestration, scripts + rules + AI only for judgment
- Trade-off: Flexibility vs determinism

#### Relationship to Phase 4B-2

**Phase 4B-2 Context:**
- 650+ participants reconciled across 11 batches
- 6-tool investigation workflow (PAST_LEARNINGS, CSVs, fuzzy match, Fathom, Town Hall agendas, Gmail)
- Systematic discipline problems identified:
  - Claiming to check without executing
  - Stopping after 3-4 tools instead of all 6
  - Asking about "Indy" 5+ times despite past resolution
  - Creating bypass scripts that skip forcing functions

**What worked:**
- Forcing functions in canonical pipeline
- Human-AI collaboration (HTML review â†’ CSV feedback)
- PAST_LEARNINGS.md accumulation (300+ patterns)
- Progress tracking (show which tools used)

**What didn't work:**
- Relying on AI memory across sessions
- Documentation saying "please check X"
- Assuming AI will be disciplined

**Result:** 100% completion (459/459 validated), but at high human oversight cost

#### Current Status

**Phase:** Experimental / Future Investigation

**Not Implemented:**
- Drone architecture is a proposal, not implementation
- Would require significant refactoring of Phase 4B-2 workflow
- Would need testing to validate 70% auto-resolution claim

**Possible Future Work:**
1. Implement drone scripts for Phase 4B-2 tools
2. Test auto-resolution rate on historical data
3. Compare cost/time vs current workflow
4. Consider mcp-agent framework integration
5. Generalize to other AI-human workflows

**Questions to Answer:**
- Does 70% auto-resolution claim hold in practice?
- Is the architectural overhead worth the discipline gains?
- Can mcp-agent provide similar benefits with more flexibility?
- What tasks actually require high-cognition AI vs deterministic rules?

- integration_scripts/generate_batch_CANONICAL.py - Forcing functions implementation

**System Principles:**
- /WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md - Human-AI collaboration philosophy

**Historical Context:**
- Phase 4B-2 completed October 23, 2025
- These reflections written same day, while discipline problems fresh
- Intended as lessons for future AI-human workflows
