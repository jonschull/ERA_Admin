## 💬 Transcript

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just got a Zoom, a Fathom transcript of an ERA African Medal that I don't understand.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was for today.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll forward it to you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's sort of mysterious.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, that's weird.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did it say anything?

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it did.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a feeling we've configured this and if people show up an hour early, I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I just sent a reminder email to a whole bunch of people on the list because I had sent it out about a week ago because I saw it hadn't been done and but I can't add people to the I can't edit the invitation I can only send an email.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I said I sent an email last week about it and then I sent an email about 50 minutes ago saying that it was happening, but if the rest of the regular attendees need to get added to the list, I think you're going to have to do it.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, do you want to tell me who they are?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** we're waiting just a minute.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also, we have a file which I will.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Share with you.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Turns out, my periodontist has got a conference for them, and they serve coffee, so I'm a happy camper here.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello there.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** right.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is the current list of African members and people that have been coming on and off to our focus.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I've invited Leonard, who has said he was going to show.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's He's here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard is here.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Estin is here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Leonard, let's you and I try to give you control of this invite so you can add and maintain the list.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll work on that as soon as I figure out how.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll do it for my computer.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But capture this list that Ananda is, I think, putting into the chat.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And let's make sure everything is all synced up.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard and I have been working on lists and things.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as a matter of fact, Leonard, last night I managed to harvest one to two thousand of my LinkedIn followers and connections and I'm still working on it.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's a start.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've put it into that list.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I want to write letters to different groups of them.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we'll use your Survey Monkey.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is that what it is?

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what mail system do you use?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MailChimp.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MailChimp, not to be confused with Survey Monkey.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a theme here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And can I have access to this spreadsheet?

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If I just put it on a tab, on the tab you created for me.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just don't send any emails yet, but you can see that I've been doing some work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Alright, okay.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard Helpfully suggested that it would be a good time to send a donation appeal to our contact.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're trying to get that under control.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm giving you access Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, know, one of the other things is to confirm that they are all in the ERA Africa WhatsApp group.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I've added most of the newer ones, what the ones maybe that don't show up very often.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have not.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So is it interesting that no one is here except for us chickens?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that is one thing that I have noticed is that people in the world work on our Google calendars and people in the global south do not tend to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's right.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** On other hand, I didn't realize that, in fact, we're not alone.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have Ananda and Ellie and Mara and Michael and Leonard and Aston and Imbalisi.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Edward is supposed to be joining us.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I had sent him the link on his WhatsApp.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He was the one that flagged me that he did not receive a calendar invite to the Zoom meeting.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, cool.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as someone put a totally fresh link into the ERA Africa WhatsApp, I know that Eliza shared a link earlier and one hopes it's the same link.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it is.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that should do it.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I've had, you know, I'm ready to begin, and I've had several recent conversations, I will, if you like, I will just bring everyone up to date.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've had a lot of recent conversations.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But two days ago, Mara and Leonard, and a few other people, I think, compared to those, Mara has a vision, and I think she's right, that there's sort of an emerging pattern of regenerative learning hubs, experiential learning hubs in Africa, that Belize, and Eston, and Usman, I'm forgetting the big one, Edward Paul.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and Kennedy, who Mara introduced me to, are all working on similar ideas, all facilities that would be opportunities for hands-on experiential learning of regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mara has a vision and she's had some experience and I discussed it or I shared that document with Ellie yesterday who is getting up to speed very quickly and has all sorts of ideas about how to create sort of a collaborative infrastructure for us.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I saw an email come in from Michael but frankly I haven't remembered what it said but that's the context for us being here.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I don't know if someone wants Mara's document then Mara or Ellie could put a link to it into the chat.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm on my phone in my periodontist's office.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're on mute, Mara, animated as ever, but silent.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** with my hands.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I've met a few of you, but I don't know if I've met everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm Mara Huber, and I'm at University at Buffalo right now.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I didn't know you were sharing that document.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it was very much just me trying to get some thoughts down, but the hope was that it would be collaborative and folks would build on it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we can certainly share it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My work focuses on the experiential learning side.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I set up experiences that lead to skill and competency development.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It can be integrated with courses and connect with sustainability partners and add value to the partners.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I focus on the learning first and I realize we need to flip it and focus on the regeneration and then it also leads to the education.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there's some, there's some work to be done, but I wanted to just sort of start from where I have access because this is the work that I do.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know how we want to pull up the document and talk about it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John, I wasn't sure that this was going to be the focus.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I do not want to take over anything.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll let everybody stop.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that's very nice.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think let me just say that I think the fresh perspective is Mara is a university buffalo.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's led the number of trips to Tanzania with students in the past.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The recipe, which I think is emerging, is that you could imagine groups of students from the global north going to the kinds of facilities that embellish.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Belize and Eston are trying to create a meeting with people like Leonard and Belize and Eston and other locals doing the regenerative work and both learning from them and documenting what's going on.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so it becomes an opportunity for hands-on experience of regenerative work for cross-cultural collaboration and communication and for bringing Western money into these small regional hubs in such a way and storytelling by, I believe that that in Belize is a video documentary.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, Leonard, I beg your pardon.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard has done some wildlife cinematography and in my fantasy many of the American students would also be

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** this trip in part in order to have an opportunity to do field documentation.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John, I just want to add that it's not, so I see the American students, to be honest with you, as a foundational way to support and sustain this.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, and I've shared my book.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a huge demand for experiential learning, and there's a lot of research on the academic and cognitive side, and there's just a million reasons why it's growing, but there's a need for experiential learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, through our work, the idea of connecting students with real-world problems and the folks who are doing the work just makes sense from a million different directions, and I've tried to lay that out.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I want to point out that there's an even bigger reason to engage youth from the challenged communities and regions in experiential learning, and I'm working in Nigeria, in

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** a state that is adopting this further whole basic education system, and it's creating a model.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a Nugu Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can share it with you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know, to create a business model, I think it really has to be a model that prioritizes the work, you know, the sustainability work, but layers in the academic needs and all of this other stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think there's just so much there.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it Ananda or Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a beautiful name.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, yeah, just to say, I shared in the chat one of the first shares, the list of people that have been regularly or semi-regularly coming to these focused meetings, and I think that quite a number of them actually have regenerative demonstration centers.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** different parts of Africa and they are their main focus is is teaching regenerative approaches to farmers in Africa which is I think really at the heart of it but I think bringing in people from North America and studies and resources is a really good way of funding it and tying it together because they don't have the organizational structure but I do think that we could really pull something together starting with a core group of different projects spotted over over Africa of centers that are already have already started doing this work and have small nonprofit community organizations that can receive the money and what you know our part could be helping them structure this

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** tying it all together and bringing funding sources into it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and I was just responding to Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What we're finding is the media, right, the media content is huge because it becomes an engine to engage others, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so in my model, anything can be a project as long as there's a mentor, as long as it's facilitated, and as long as it culminates in something tangible.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a system that uses, we call it the Perl project framework that P is prepare, E is engage, A is add value, R is reflect, and L is leverage.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And each of those just has just minimal structured online prompts to them to help students do the cognitive.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of work while they're engaging.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they produce something.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've experimented with story maps for the storytelling, but also some of the other deliverables that can connect with the partner's work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they get a badge at the end, a digital badge.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the evidence of their project gets embedded in the badge.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So imagine that the student gets a badge that says sustainability, eco restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have one with humanitarian mapping.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The student is able to show evidence of their competency or achievement.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they own that and they can build on that.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But then on the other end, you get to track the badges and sort of see the impacts of these.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At our university, we make project funds available.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if a student wanted to do an eco restoration project, we're able to give them funds to support them.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So imagine if you have mentors from all over the world.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** who do the work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have partners who are looking to do more and scale their work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have young people and educators and then you can start bringing in targeted funds.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What if you had a sustainable innovation that wanted to market their brick-making and wanted to give a tool that could be used, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You start to see how all of this can build out.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we have done this at our university.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're scaling across New York, but the ideas can be scaled even further and frozen.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's exactly what you said.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The focus has to be on the work and then you start layering in these other things.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what started this conversation, this conversation, is Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I call him Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** His camera is off.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've been trying to get a trip.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo's in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** he can show you where he is.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And my good part, long time partner, Kennedy is in Tanzania but it's a 10 hour drive.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Kennedy has a farm where he does soil stabilize bricks, eco latrines, water catchment takes, beekeeping.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He has a lot of, we call them community technologies.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we wanted to bring Colombo and his colleague through the first innovation scouting trip to tour and to get some video and to get some educational content to then bring back to his refugee submit community to start seeding the experiential learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we haven't been able to raise the funds.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** would take about a thousand dollars to make this happen.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And when I spoke to John, he said this might resonate and maybe you could share this bigger idea.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so that's really

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** see what we've been thinking about doing.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ali.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is extremely exciting and Dev tells really well with, I think, our vision.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you've heard, but this is sort of the target that I'm giving everyone to focus on as our goal is 100 million projects by 2030.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what you've started is a great model for attempting to actually deliver that sort of scale.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm interested very much to support the structuring of this as a proposal and as a program.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm sort of curious about technical details.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you mentioned that there's funds that are available from University of Buffalo for students to do projects.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's fantastic.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is that a sustainable source?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do we need to think about other sorts of funding sources as this would scale?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it tuition that's going towards this?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** so on and so on?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so this would have to be...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** staff did and customized.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I went so far as to say I used Perl.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know, in that proposal, I came up with Earth, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I threw in restoration and hands-on learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I customized models.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I have the core model, but I've been translating it in different environments.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what we do at UB is just for UB, unfortunately.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, so I'm limited in what I can do directly through UB.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's why John and I have been talking about, you know, going for it and building something that is scalable.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mine is in Africa and I say low resource, high potential environments that have youth and have all of this potential.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's where I'm interested in.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so it would need to be customized.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I do have, I guess what I'm sharing is we have piloted it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have tested the ideas, but they need to be translated.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So our

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** funding does come through a fee that students pay but we can't give the money to our African partners even though our partners are providing the opportunities for our students.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's hard to spend the money for the global projects right because there are so many rules.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have built in support for our Tanzanian partner by making a trip so we've done a study abroad trip successfully for many years and we're able to build in a program fee because the students do a build while they're there.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there is a market for study abroad trips who bring students and they can create the budget and they build it into the budget.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is a market for conferences so I just ran an experiential learning institute in Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If I was able to run an experiential learning institute on site I bet I would do

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** able to get a lot of people to go because they'd be able to pay for it that way.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think, you know, I've been starting to think about budget.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think there are ways students will pay for projects if there was a way to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** know, so there are these revenue streams that could help to set this up, but it would all have to be sort of customized.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm dying to know what you do, Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know this is an opportunity for us to get to know each other, but what do you do?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, well, I build ecosystems.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I kind of connect a facilitation with stakeholders with technology systems to scale interactions around sustainability goals.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, we could go into more detail, you know, maybe on another call.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But a lot of the things that you're talking about, which is a media are great ways to galvanize people into build programs around that.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, we're really trying to bring the marketplace together and populate that, you know, with folks that have the knowledge.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep, go ahead.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We will have to talk and we do have data because we've been so we do have a few years of data in some grants that we've started writing.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, um, yeah, let's look forward to talk.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll reach out.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just, I would like to appreciate the work you are doing and the team because this work is very important.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would like to learn more, maybe next time with Colombo, because I'm trying to establish something like this.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a farm and today I visited my, my farm.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a short, a small farm, of course, but at least I have seven species, seven agroforest trees and fruits trees.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So,

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** way it is, you know, when you see it, it's really amazing and I would one day invite you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what I wanted to say is that supporting and funding this kind of more initiative is very important and critical because before I started that firm, I had nothing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But after that, I made some challenges with dry season.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** now I'm happy to get a small fund from Collaborative for Change to buy tanks so that I may correct water and then I will be getting in the dry season.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what I wanted to say is this is a really nice initiative.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I would like to learn more and share an experience if you need.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I really appreciate it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, just to mention, the piece that hasn't been mentioned yet is what we've seen is that

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** our partners who are doing the work, many of them don't have access to other models in country.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so what we're interested in doing too is having part of the money go for training so that you could visit other leaders and learn just like we're trying to do with Colombo and Kennedy to share the models because the innovation is happening.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's happening at the local level.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I just was going to add that I think Mara's experience at UB is hugely validating for us but we're also, we have a big opportunity because Mara's convinced that this wants to be a not a UB centric project but something that spans and isn't confined within a particular universe.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, figuring out the organizational framework for this network of learning experiences is a huge opportunity.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I don't think it should be owned or controlled by any education system, but all education systems should be invited to contribute and participate.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think that's a really important nuance that I've been exploring for the last 15 to 20 years, and I'm pretty sure working within within the system and within its constraints.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I just want to say that Edward and Marius have just joined us.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the things that Edward is is working with with his demonstration center is he wants to build the infrastructure to receive guests.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think that would be the same thing for many of these places.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You need the the infrastructure.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** structure to receive guests if you've got people from international places you have to feed them you have to lodge them and and so that's a fundamental thing and I'm thinking that the the um educational aspect in bringing people from the global north um makes this project maybe a bit sexier for funders but still we need to look for a funding source I don't know maybe something through something like the agroecology fund or some type of thing that we could draw together these little organizations on the ground that are already starting to do this need to build that infrastructure and could then provide the the environment to to bring in students from other places just to mention Kennedy has has that so we

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** started by saying we're trying in the short term to fund this trip as a way to get this started.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kennedy Mahilley is in Tanzania with all those community projects and he has a farm and he has housing.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He has housed successfully our architecture students who went on a study abroad.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** so what's nice is he has that as we're trying to build this with some of the other partners.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what I really envision is almost like a what do you call it when you have a trail, right, like a freedom trail or you have trails with featured partners.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Visually I think of like a story, you know, a story map where you can engage with them virtually through experiential learning and provide support.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you imagine a class wanting to learn about beekeeping and they want to actually connect.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I connect students

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** with my partners all the time via Zoom and professors, so there should be a way to virtually connect and do projects or there could be ways, when appropriate, to go and do visitation.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that can, I imagine a collaborative where it can look a little different in each of the places, but there are common, there's a common frame, you know, there there's a common focus and then a percentage of money could go to support, you know, things like a like a collaborative is sort of what I was thinking.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so I mean it sounds like basically what is needed is like a corporate structure for lack of a better term to organize the transactions, right, the the financial, fiduciary relationships, the distribution, the vetting of participants in the network, that sort of initial structure.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, which I think, you know, we can rapidly design that, um, I'm curious since we have, you know, 30 minutes left on this call, um, what other resources, other, you know, details do do you think are relevant to share?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What other ideas have you had?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I think we need it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** mean, the big idea that I have been playing with is we need an app.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I need a pearl app, um, that literally could turn any problem or challenges into an opportunity for a project in a badge, but then on the back end could give us all the data that we need, right, to track this.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the way that we do this at the university and that we can set something up to show you is we just use like a form-based workflow that literally just walks you from step to step because all you're doing is uploading information.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** know, at the beginning, you're having them set intentions.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do you want to get out of this project?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do you want to do?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We need to set the structure of the project.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to make sure that they have the outputs that connect with everything that everyone wants to do.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there's a lot of just thinking it through, tying it to research questions about the data that you want.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the technology interface would have to be thought through.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It doesn't have to be complicated, but it could be, know, I have some thoughts about that needs to be built.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have some practice, some software people.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But really it's the interface.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's the website portal where you have all of this and you create your presence.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then it's the business structure and then thinking about how you want to put it into motion.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So a lot of planning thinking.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, so you've come to the right place.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I've been working on designs for exactly this kind of app, thinking about the level of scale from the beginning.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if we were to get to 100 million projects, we'd really need to have some tooling for that that moves people from concept through to to fruition to the resource allocation and so on and activate AI right to support that process.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we've got a lot of pieces and I don't want to bore everyone here by going into the details.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We will definitely talk about this Mara but I have actually already developed a little bit of an MVP.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It doesn't quite do what you're describing but the intention is to build further towards that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the workflow scheduling is the next step but we currently have a prototype that we've made for NASA actually to connect researchers with projects with goals and initiatives and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the first planning piece is there and I'm happy to go through that and maybe we can you know think about the design concepts for this particular workflow.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's fantastic and it's funny you see NASA because my co-author on that book is WAL.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** out of the NASA globe educational fees and so the opportunity to connect this in with the satellite climate data that's coming in is also really exciting and then we've already been playing with AI to to um sort of tweak the projects so that right they could utilize I mean there's just so much so yes I'm so excited to talk to you so you tell me when you want to discuss this and then maybe others want to be part of it because it might excite um this work might might or might not excite everybody so yeah yeah if anyone else wants to listen to I guess the conversation about the tech um let me know something email or just throw your name or email in the chat here um Mara if you don't mind sharing your email just so I easily have it um I will follow up yeah very soon um and then also I'm interested just to even know pick your brain a little bit more about how

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** where you see this connecting in, especially in the partnership spaces?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm ready for that conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been doing all of this on my own, and so I would welcome all of it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, just to have to tell you, buddy, that the video media piece of this is huge.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the fact this is your expertise, I would love if you unmute and tell us a little bit more about what you're doing in that space.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, well, thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do some work around filmmaking and film production because professionally, I'm an environmentalist, but I follow some courses about film production because I've been interested in storytelling.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** combining those skills, being able to interview people, to make some.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** film short films and you know it helps to to share the the knowledge the stories very easily so I have a skills on film production but I do it when I get something to tell a story about people it's not like a professional work but sometimes because I'm part of Rwanda wildlife filmmakers at some time we we shoot some videos and documentaries so now we are working on a documentary between which is a langer exchange between Rwanda and the US those there are two national parks that they are exchanging langers so one went to the US to Smoky Mountains and the other one we come to Rwanda Nyong'o National Park so we did

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** a film about that program so that we may show people that, you know, sharing knowledge and exchange is very important and the langer will be sharing the experience on how they, you know, what they have seen, how different is the environment, what are the works in the U.S., how is the work in the Rwanda national parks and but also I did a short film during COP 28.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was people sharing stories and their perceptions about climate change, their fear and what their message is.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** maybe I can share the film too.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, if you have a link, that'd be great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah and one thing that I've been thinking about and it's sort of seemed far away but I guess maybe not is a media platform indeed.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** dedicated to these kinds of stories, you know, if you look around, there's really not a great place for that, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yet this is how we really motivate cultural change.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is that something, Mara, that you have any thoughts on?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** so the stories, the piece that I want to add is that the stories become opportunities for projects.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the linking with the framework, so imagine you have the app that can transform anything.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Imagine you have media that doesn't just educate and inspire, but it actually leads to the climate action, which is through the projects, which is then you can actually activate funding.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you have a good project to connect to academic programs, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You see this whole ecosystem.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then suddenly the media in the stories, especially from those who are closest to the challenges, and then the opportunities to do

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, yeah, that's that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's exactly what I've been working on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John, go ahead.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just wanted to say two things.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One, my phone may die, but I'm very excited about the way this conversation is going.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if it dies, I will make Ananda the co-host just in case.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And number two, Edward, welcome.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you've been able to catch up on the conversation, but there's a very interesting initiative emerging to take sites like the kind you're developing and create a network of sites that could be visited by students from the global north and collaborating with people like you and Leonard and Colombo doing this kind of thing.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So just just to let you know that I think that what you're already trying to do is likely to become a prototype for a network of these

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** experiential learning resource centers and I think we've got a really good group of people who can make it so yeah thank you very much indeed I was the first to check in but later it was not working so I went out went out thought it was not through so I was just chancing then luckily enough again I got it but I I think I will get the recordings if the not take eyes not agnest me and two with regards to making the hamlet a prototype in fact it is and we are looking forward to having a global network but first we want to develop these and to see how we're gonna replicate like in Kenya we have some partners already the region campus the virtual reality and then Ghana already we have and I've been referring them to era

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And here we are trying to really move from where we are in the local setup to a global network because currently we are entering a memorandum of understanding with several universities, like in Quebec University, in California, in Poland.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm greatly happy that I always as we are members to ERA, if you want to move further you have to step onto one's shoulder to see further.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm great that ERA is still lifting us high and I hope with ERA we are going to move to our expectations.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Indeed we are sharing globally and I should thank Regeneration Canada because it has opened our eyes these past two years.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are moving from the localized setup

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** up to an international network and we are happy that we need to develop the infrastructure to host our because if you're talking about a prototype you don't have to visit a university then you stay away from the university you have to be within the setup because whenever you do come like John or Ananda comes in you can open up our eyes and we further develop so it would be better to stay on the site enjoy the roughness the toughness and you enjoy the fun as well because our work is tough it's rough but it's fun thank you thank you Edward I also have a couple of questions do you have any documentation that you've been sharing with the partners that you mentioned or that you could share with us oh sure I have some documentation in need

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** did we were working as I said locally but we have many documentation like you say it feed the future we have they've been visiting the site we had some some loans from those you know it was investment loan in the initial place so we have some links we have some information we can share if you could send me if you could send me your I'm sorry I'm an analog I'm trying to learn this technology given the fact that we're in the setup and I'm happy that Ananda was also trying to train me how to use Google documents but I'm always using WhatsApp so you could send me your WhatsApp I can share I'm still an analog I'm still an analog person and on the phone I know to call WhatsApp and zoom you can find me I just put my number in the chat

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me know, I guess, I will get your number if that doesn't work from someone else.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, we do have an ERA WhatsApp group and I believe Ellie has just been added to it.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the Leonard is going to make sure that all of us are subscribed to it.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But sharing through that will create a virtual paper trail that we can catch up on as people begin to gather around this initiative.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, if someone has leadership controls to add me to that, then that would be the best place for follow-up.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I'm giving Leonard the keys to all of this thing.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Leonard, let's make sure that you have that ability.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, just to say on the idea.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of the importance of documentaries, Michael, the resources that Michael was sharing earlier were on different projects.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of them being Andrew Millison's work in Africa and Andrew does amazing documentation like really strong visuals that if you post these visuals on a social media post you get lots and lots of hits.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you know I think that's really powerful both for raising awareness, educating and sharing information but also for fundraising it's really important to have some great documentation and just to add that earlier today Edward was showing me the guest house that he's in the process of building.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's making a mud guest house with a grass roof and it's very beautiful.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And just, you know, things like that, if we're trying to raise money to get the infrastructure to build guest facilities in all these different places where we could bring people in to learn.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** would be super helpful just to have those visuals.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just to share, because you were asking about potential, since you're thinking of an app, the one area that I think is the most powerful, if we were going to have some projects that cut across everything is actual restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And starting with on the ground in situ data with partners or use to look at levels of degradation.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then do projects that actually try to move the dial have dashboards.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** at yellow, red, green just to show.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have the groups afterwards actually again look at posts and get some data and then be able to show what you've done and if you were doing it virtually you'd be doing it indirectly through doing fundraising and contributing and doing things or you could go on the ground and be part of it but there are ways to actually do the projects tied.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It doesn't have to be there's so many other ways but imagine if you did that and then you used AI and climate data to sort of see what the best ways to do it and to keep informing the system.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you could literally have the packages so when we've done this with GIS mapping there are ways to take like the tiles and divide it up into like having mapping projects so right now with all

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the missing map work, you could divide up a region.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If I knew where AdWords lived, and I could mark it on a map, I could split up tiles and have students do mapping from satellite maps.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You could do that right now.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But you also do that with like an eco restoration project.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then literally have that if you have your $3 million or $20 million project, those could be auto generated.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the potential for scaling when you really think about some of these, if you have some of these things in place, mean, you could totally start it in a way that wasn't like that, but I just wanted to share that since it seems like you're thinking big.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I mean, that's exactly, everything you're saying is exactly the patterns that we're pursuing.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just like very broadly, want to indeed have a geographical sort of digital twin where

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** information from satellites, whatever else is available, including person observations can be synthesized to sort of, you know, identify triage opportunities, most important ecosystems, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That then gets analyzed through, you know, feasibility.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do we actually have access to?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where is there sort of, you know, friendlies that have land that we can use versus maybe there needs to be some more prep work?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then that, you know, would automatically be able to be connected to certain kinds of projects and experts who were especially, you know, sort of suitable for guidance in various ways.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then, you know, of course, I could then connect into students and other workforce on the ground.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, exactly right.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm so excited to meet and just share notes.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we're thinking about the same things.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Michael.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just two comments here.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is that, you know, I just sent that list of.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** YouTubes and Africa eco restoration last night, and looking at this group here, I was just reflecting on, I think, most of them, not all of them, but most of them were created by people of the North, rather than created within Africa itself.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I think it would be really powerful to have our African friends there or those of you who have, Ananda might have looked into this.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What are some good documentaries or good YouTubes videos produced by Africans in Africa that we can highlight?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think would be a powerful thing, so I'm just going to encourage those two for us to look for those so we can highlight them as well.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the other comment I would like to make is that

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know that much about Africa, I'm just here as an observer in a sense, but also I do know that there are thousands of projects, restoration type projects and training centers that already exist in Africa, thousands, and in every country has them and some of them are for local people that work for local people or within a particular country and some of them are shared trainings between countries but they don't involve people from the global north much or at all and some of those would be interested in partnering with us and so having a really good idea of what's out there already who's already out there and linking with them is a really good way to scale up quickly rather than in a sense finding people that are just starting projects

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ready out there I think is really important and shows that we're doing due diligence that we're not just trying to come in from outside and set something up new but we're trying to link up with what's already happening on the ground so I'd really like to point that out and encourage that I have a few I have some connections there and assist us anyway just wanted to point point that out that we really there's a lot out there already and there's a lot happening on the ground in Africa and we should be working with what's there as well as trying to create something new so anyway I have to be properly at 10 but it's nice to see people hear some friends Marius hello and Eston so I look for and Colombo I look forward to working more with people hopefully over time so

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very Can I say something?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a little late.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi John.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, of course John, hello.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, how are you guys?

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm John.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry I was held up in another meeting.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We had a co-meeting, so I was splitting my time between these two for my organization, which is Masgira Najami Africa, an NGO based in Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm sorry I'm late.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I just wanted to say hi to you guys and if you have any questions, let me know.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll drop the links to my organization and whatever we are doing in the chat here.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm sorry and thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, thank you John.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And just give us a quick description of what you're working towards.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Masgira Najami Africa, Masgira means environment.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jamis people, so it's people and environment.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Masgira was born out of a program.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We had at Yale University, which was Environmental Leadership Training Institute.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we had an opportunity to do a one-year certification program with them, and we had an opportunity to visit Philippines, some of us visited Colombia, some of us visited Brazil, but we came together just as three of us young people, not young anymore, but the gentlemen are talking about a young, they're in their late early 20s, think.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, one is Jaffet and also Bulimo, and also we also have a professor from Masino University, because we realize that you have to integrate the university in the core management of environment, because they archive the knowledge, they also help in extension work, and also they can also help when you write joint grants together in facilitated funding.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At the core of it, what we really tend to do is we attempt to restore the Victoria Basin, which is in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda, probably a bit of some headwaters are in Burundi.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But literally, we are starting in Kenya and we are managing about five major rivers in Kenya that feed into the desert.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you go to online and check the satellite image, you'll see that the water on the Kenyan side is very tabby.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, there's a lot of eutrophication on the Kenyan side.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And sometimes we have the problem with water hyacinth also, which blocks the lake, shocks the lake because of a lot of fertilizer, nutrients that tend to flow.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there are lot of human activities upstream.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So for right now, we are just starting off and our organization does other things apart from, you know, restoration.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we feel that our command is restoration and we want to restore, especially the Perian buffers along these rivers, two rivers of interest that maybe you want to take away from this one is called Rivagnando, which floods a lot.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a perennially flooding river.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the other river is called River Mara, which is a very popular river.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** knows about it.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have the Serengeti and Masaimara, but well, it's crossing.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we want to restore that river.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope we won't be eaten by hyenas when we plant trees or crocodiles.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we have the local Maasai community who are some members of our restoration group.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So apart from that we also want to do some bit of wash programs, water health and sanitation because it's really something that resonates a lot.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then there's also agroforestry and also dealing with farmers at the interface because one of the key challenges we have is, you know, farmers are doing very unsustainable cultural practices that also contribute to that.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I was blessed to meet John through a mutual friend.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that mutual friend is launching his own NGOs as well.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think he's doing a great job with farming and also farm forestry and stuff.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we work very, very closely together.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it is my hope that, you know, we can get partners that can support us in whatever.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** way we also have whether it's technical expertise or if you can donate a tree whatever you can do you know we have a donate button if you are you feel guilty you've been globetrotting and polluting you want to plant a tree you know drop us about that would be great uh we have a podcast that we did also as well and that it was not the best podcast but uh it's a choppy thing you so we are bootstrapping you know when the organization so what you're bringing young people with young uh what you them uh tech team that are building podcast podcasts so that they can tell stories from their own perspective and we also want to do some urban forestry stuff and green infrastructure I don't know how many people have visited Nairobi here who has visited Nairobi Kenya so John I wasn't in Nairobi but I take students tomorrow at Tanzania right to the Mara and my name is Mara to the Mara

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** her and we students there I've been going there since 2009 so we're right on the border and the trip the trip that we're trying to plan is in Tanzania which is not too far either so I think we're in a similar region we work with Uganda, Tanzania and we're really close to you.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow that's and you know Mara is the same river it's the same those are the same people the Masais of Tanzania and the Masais of Kenya they the same people and I know lots of people don't believe me but the park is the same some people say they are visiting Serengeti some people say they are visiting Masaimara it is the same park because the borders of the country are divided by that river that we want to you know rescue so I have dropped our website link right there let me drop my my email address and I'm also dropping my LinkedIn profile we can connect

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you have a question, you can ask me and I look forward to, you know, working with you, folks.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that we should be adding all of this to that spreadsheet that's in the ERA drive.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And just to jump on to what Michael said, I think that we already within this group, have many African, we have a core of African based organizations that are run by Africans for Africans.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think that what we in the global North have means and a culture and education to do certain things that perhaps they don't have those resources.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I don't think we need to look for any other groups because we already have a core right here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what we need to do is to listen.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and empower them, not come in as white saviors putting a vision onto it, but they have something going on.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have a vision.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can help them to enable that.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I think that we really need to find the balance between offering what we have to offer and listening and following.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see that Leonard had his hand up a minute ago.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know we have one minute left.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** as we see if Leonard has a last thought, Ananda, I think a great way to approach that is to actually organize more direct sessions, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where we think of ERA as an equipment space, what do we need to equip you to do?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What would be helpful, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And sort of have this interactive dialogue, which would ultimately move us forward into organizational structures as well.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And perhaps sorting some of these things like on that on that spreadsheet, looking at what everybody does, maybe getting them to give a presentation so that everyone has a clearer idea and then brainstorming about how we can move that further along.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great idea.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll take a note.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will put this recording into the WhatsApp group, and Leonard will make sure that John and everyone else are in the WhatsApp group.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John, I feel that we've sort of reached a really nice beachhead critical mass during this meeting today.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I would encourage you to catch up on the recording.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we have an initiative cooking here that has legs as they say.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they can really create a model led by the people in this group based on projects in and of Africans in Africa,

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy to say, I think we can add value to just by acting as facilitators or equipment providers, as Ellie says.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's structuring.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Getting grants.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Getting grants.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** another thing is technical expertise to us, that goes a long way.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it looks like we have a lot of things to pursue in our next call, which I think is two weeks from now.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will get together a little bit of structure around the conversation that we had today and hopefully we can go on from there in the next time we meet.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Fantastic.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ellie, you're going to share the link, right?

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To the meeting so we can listen in, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't have that link.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We'll get it together.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will share a document to the WhatsApp group before we meet in two weeks.

**{'display_name': 'john Magugu', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll go to run I think so goodbye but it was such a great time just chatting and seeing all the great energy here so looking forward to it.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'jon', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

## 💬 Transcript

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's my friend, Austin, who's been there as well.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, the network is still, it's bad, so, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You sound like a busy man.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And well, and well connected.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, John.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Diana.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I thought your presentation was terrific as a town hall meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very helpful to get the big picture.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was just the Nakavali presentation, but it's a small scale of what I'm doing elsewhere.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I assume I've said this before, but we could really use your competence in what you're doing as we try to make these, make this all fit together.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm happy to do what I can, John.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, easy to say.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** for me the trick is figuring out what exactly that means but we'll get there we'll get there um I see that we are surrounded by notepakers including mine and I think I'm going to bump all the others and then put mine into the calendar event so everyone has it okay and that's my policy because people complain that these ai's burning up a lot of uh a lot of energy these days yeah I guess if we think about the environmental impact in the data storage component that makes sense it's good to make that point I think all right wow so now we're we're just uh five well that's right I'm mosa I don't know that I but here comes more it's only 1202 and there's Amanda

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, and Laura, how nice for people to roll in here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Laura, terrific.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you for organizing all the new names being added to the list, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, we're upping our game every day these days.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's nice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And speaking of which, just because I can, I will share with you my latest linked in post, which features Ananda's book.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That post has been re-shared, I'll tell you in a moment, three or four times already, which is unusual for us.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are a post or John Scholl post?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's currently a John Scholl post, but Leonard, I'm sure is in the process of making it and he are a post.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's what he does now.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, well, I will be sure to repost it.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've already purchased three and on us.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** wow.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And when I go to Africa, I'll be sure to take some more with me because I like to give out books for gifts.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wonderful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Click.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Click.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda, when are you going to Africa?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In mid-February.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And now are you going to be just in Uganda?

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or if you want to talk privately another time, that's fine.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Actually, I think it's relevant.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So why don't we begin the meeting?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm hesitating.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Look, I'm all fuzzy again.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's an electronic thing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Now, if I disconnect, let me make Ananda co-host.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me invite anyone else to actually moderate this discussion.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And once I've made Ananda co-host, I'll disconnect and reconnect.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's see if I get all cut off.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's happened before.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So first, I need to make you co-host.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then I will wait for you to acknowledge that you have become co-host.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm going to make you host.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I got a notification.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And now I hope to see you in a less fuzzy state in a moment.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't actually see you, Kendi, but happy you're here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jeffrey, I don't think we've met before.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I, for better or for worse, I'm the common denominator here, so I will frame who's here and what's going on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I remet Jeffrey just a few minutes ago.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He's based in Cologne, but he's worked in Uganda, and he's working with a number of groups.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** are working in slums and refugee camps and he seems to know a lot of people in particular in Uganda so he's going to be introducing himself.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yesterday, merely yesterday, Mara and Ellie and I and I don't think Ananda were there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes and then we were joined by Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're sort of talking about this emerging possible network of related projects surrounding Lake Victoria and I think we've got something really nice that that ought to coalesce so someone perhaps Mara ought to summarize what that is beginning to look like and we're beginning to play around with the idea of piggybacking on Ananda's plan to spend some

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** time in that region um in February to March.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Meanwhile um and Belize has been doing some good work and Leonard has now taken on a role of leadership and recruiting in getting people to these meetings and updating our lists and trying to pull these things together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think that's those are a lot of incremental improvements since a mere two weeks ago and uh also I saw that Kendi and Moses are here I don't see Kendi at the moment it's like she dropped off maybe she'll come and maybe I don't believe I've met Moses before so I'm going to pass the moderator ship to the first person to raise their hand and say I'll take it from here.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I saw Ellie's hand raised go set your hand Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No it was

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was a clap.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And perhaps you can get Moses and Kendi to introduce themselves, because these are names and George, these are names I've seen around, but haven't made.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe we should do a quick round of introductions.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here she goes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, go for it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Take it away.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I'll start.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we could just pass it to the next person.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe that's the easiest way.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Mara Huber.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm joining you from the University of Buffalo in Western New York, right near Niagara Falls.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I have a recent book, and I have a model that connects project-based learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I do experiential learning with the sustainable development goals and with community-based partners who are doing the work of sustainable development within vulnerable ecosystems and communities.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I work very closely with Colombo, as well as other partners in Tanzania, Uganda, and Nigeria, primarily.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is my work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Happy to see Diana.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Why don't you go next?

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am Diana Dohe.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am in northern New England in the snow in New Hampshire.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** for the past few years, I have transitioned to probably my final career in nature-based solutions, focused on Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I am currently working on a program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I'm also working with Colombo and Mara on another project.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I hope to work with some other people that are on this group here and looking at a project also in South Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You picked someone to hand it off.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** keep it moving.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Michael you want to go?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm just here, excuse me, just visiting and seeing if I can be of help in any way but I'm new to the group here.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll pass it on to Moses then.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, good evening team.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm looking forward to meeting this team and

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, let me pass it around to someone else.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can see Russ Hi there, yeah, so this I think this group will be able to Start collaborating and do some important things on the ground pretty soon Especially some watershed restoration To try to get some of the flooding reduced in Africa and Let's pass it to Edward Yeah, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have been just in a meeting with the Agakand Vomit Foundation Network who are also trying to do regenerative farming, and as you very well heard from the acronym, water is the biggest problem in this climate era whereby 95% of our communities are farmers and water is the main ingredient of whatever we are doing minus the soil and the regenerative soils, and we are in an area whereby we are having monoculture of sugarcane, and you know when you talk of sugarcane, you talk of climate change and also you talk of water depletion.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy that I'm here and

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know who I might be sending this back to, but possibly if I'm going back to a wrong place, I can just give it to Ananda who will choose it for me.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a manager for Biocha project here and for now we get a result of the water purification.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a prototype for purification of water by Biocha.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, we have a sectorful information to the projects because we get...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 61% of purification water, so we need to develop the project here in Nakiva or for all communities to get the water and we need, because I'm traveling, I've come to Kampara to present biochar and the CDER projects here in Kampara.

**{'display_name': 'Sumaidi Angale', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There we have so many projects that have plans, but not yet working on them for the lack of support.

**{'display_name': 'Sumaidi Angale', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'm mainly thinking far and we hope one day we will reach our goal.

**{'display_name': 'Sumaidi Angale', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But by joining hands, so we need supports to grow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're trying to figure out how to support you, absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Sumaidi Angale', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Pass it on to somebody else, Kakumi.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's see, Leonard, do you want to go next?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll help out just to keep it going.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, thank you so much, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Leonard, I'm based in Rwanda and that's where I came from actually.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm very excited to join this broad team of Ella Africa and others.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm excited that I joined our team last month.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm just working with the team and Johnny Leading on social media.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That I may encourage you all to just repost or share our posts so that we can boost and share our works.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's working with you all in Africa, the African team.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** hoping as I was mentioning, maybe if you can have something to support the African team, because I know all of us will have initiatives which are great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know, I've been dreaming this so.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm really excited.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So back home in Rwanda, I do have agroforestry project which is doing something that I never seen in my community.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** far, I have a model of a small farm with 150 trees with different species, mangrove, cadeaus, grapes, and whatever.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** now I'm trying to, if I finish establishing that farm, then we'll be like a center for the other farmers.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we scale it up to other species and other villages.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** happy to do with you and work with you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm reprised to...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** did Joffrey go?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have Geoffrey and Karim that are here for the first time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I might be the one to say.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Joffrey.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm from Germany and I've been helping out some different organisations in Uganda to connect to one another, especially in the generalised culture, for example, Edward Hamlet as well.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's a friend, name is Charles, from Broadview's agriculture, for example, in Ginger, where they denial.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I've been trying to make collaborations happen.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in different parts of Uganda in the last couple of years.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unfortunately, the network kind of, let's say, you need to be re-sparked again because whenever I left in Uganda, the network did not really bond in a deep way.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So a few in doing a project together, I think that was 10 bonds deeper and the relationships can foster themselves and spark up in a way that is fruitful for different organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, that's kind of what I'm hoping for.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy to connect and I'm happy to also talk to some of the

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** friends that are in Uganda, from Uganda, doing different projects as we said in Islam or in the rest of Japan, but also in rural areas, and they're all trying to promote sustainability, all regenerative ways of living in different contexts.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so thanks for this, and I'd like to take the old.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I actually I have a question if I could just jump in before you move on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jeffrey, yeah, so I'm curious, you mentioned that you kind of had a network starting in Uganda, how many people were included?

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What kind of groups, individuals, where was it based?

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you share a little bit more detail about that?

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure, so it was a network that just started out, kind of luckily with the master thesis, I was doing the master

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** first degree in sustainable design engineering and then I was working in the startup that was doing re-wilding in Copenhagen and in the startup there was one person from Uganda and said hey that's maybe the project together and then I was like I'm sure why not and then things moved on and we had a working group of five members so we were working really intensely hours per week to build up basically that particular network and to build up pieces of groundwork so we did a lot of research which we did a lot workshops, had a lot of conferences with some of the people that are doing research about culture or palm culture, aquiferous tree and different sorts of sustainable ways of treating the land and so

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, that was mostly done online.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, most of the things were done online.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, ever since then, whatever did it, Uganda, things were moving even then more, like they say, more intense in a positive way.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, with more workshops, people could meet each other physically for the time because also financing is not the, yeah, financing is also like marketing, especially because sometimes the members of different organizations are being so far away from one another, even in Uganda, even though it's such a small country.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, still, the organization, yeah, there may be eight hours apart or, know, so, that's the big struggle, for example.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, yeah, so that's kind of like the idea of options in Europe, based in the capital.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, so that's what they're going to say.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and making workshops happen.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For example, with Ginger who were invited, Edward's farm to visit his homiculture farm for this mixed farming system.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, with some other friends as well.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yeah, that was really good.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can I go?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, please.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, my name is Georgie Karohani.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the of the local angel known as the climate smart solutions and I'm managing director based in Arusha, Tanzania.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that you are not seeing me, I was just driving and just stopped somewhere so that I can attend that

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** potential meeting.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are based in Arusha and we are working with smaller farmers, especially the agro pastoral, the Masai community in the northern zone of Tanzania, as well as the others, but we are mainly focusing on the agro pastoralist.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the area which we are working with is very drought and dry and people because of the drought have been changing the life from pastoral to agriculture, you know the Masai, I don't know if you know the indigenous community which are mainly pastoralist.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So because of that one we come with the idea that we can introduce the equal installation

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** training center where we introduce the permaculture with the past improvement and whatever and due to limited funding then we just came that we can do our safer as the members of the angels to contribute ourselves and have the rent where we can execute our objective and our mission.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So far we have secured the rent, six acreage of rent and now we are proceeding with mobilizing the community especially whom we are working with so that we can execute what we intend.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's what we are doing now but also we have the project which we are developing and I think

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Here I mentioned previously that we have the company which is known as Removo.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a French company and we are developing the carbon credit through the nature-based the solutions in the kagera region and the kagera river basin.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** far it will be on agroforestry, afforestation and that will be the idea.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if planning goes as we intend, maybe probably in June we will start the execution of the project.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So far that's that's a climate smart solution what we are doing but we need some collaboration partnership and I heard that

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't remember who mentioned that she is working in Tanzania as well as Uganda and so I think we can have the contact in the network.

**{'display_name': 'George K.', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right, who's left?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ali, you haven't gone yet.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I haven't.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so I am a consultant, I guess, here.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I work with a technology company, which I'm hoping can be a foundation for some of the exchange we're talking about resources, knowledge, skills and tools.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But even before we get to that, there's a really substantial network of resources and potential opportunities that I think we're gathering here.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I'm working to put some structure around that and sort of bring us together towards a plan of how we might be able to work as a network in Africa to develop both projects and also to bring in the resources that I know everyone here needs and is looking for.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also, towards the beginning of the call, John mentioned that Mara and I and Ananda were meeting yesterday and talked sort of about a trip to Uganda, and it's still very much in early stages of thought.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what we're seeing is that there are a number of people that are in this group and also, you know, beyond now on the call today, who are based in sort of the same place, right within and across Uganda, that area surrounding area.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we would like to go to organize both ourselves and sort of meet and understand what better tools we can be providing and also to connect in with our various contacts there.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Mara has a number of official contacts that she can connect to and so on and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so, you know, the idea is how can we kind of become a larger entity or a larger group working together.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So one of the questions that I have, if we have time to kind of chat here.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** on the call is where exactly is everyone located right because as we think about entering this geographical location you know it's eight hours away if we want to go to different places and that needs to be planned.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you know is there a way that we can kind of capture the information about where everyone is physically located and start to put that on a map and plan these logistics.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I included a link to a document and it has a Google map so after I don't know if it was our last I just I had this desire to rip to this map where everybody was and I was so excited to see that literally it was like around Lake Victoria so George I've been going to Tanzania for a very long time focusing on the Mara region around Lake Victoria but I was you know I have a partner in Tanzania and I think that just gives us it's just amazing so maybe we could use that.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** often start adding to it um if folks want to do that or they can drop their location and we can we can um add to it would that be helpful ellie?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes yeah I wonder if um everyone here on the call who is based in Africa yeah if if that's an um if that works for them.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah just put your location and we can um sort of map it yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mayor do you want to share your screen to show them the map that you have in that document?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well that would make sense thank you Diana that would never just dawned on me to just do it right?

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a nice document thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The obvious absolutely yeah you can see how we started to sort of play with some of these ideas but um yeah just did the simple you know simple looking at it I thought it was extraordinary so we had Uganda um Edwards um Hamlet we have my partner in Moansa um

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that has a full farm and he does Community technology so Soil stabilized bricks used for eco latrines water catchment take speed keeping and This really started with me because Colombo who hasn't introduced himself yet.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe he can go next We wanted to get Colombo who's one of my partners to go to Mwanza in Tanzania To look at what's happening and bring it back to his immunity And so John had said that this might be a platform to think about how that could fit and this you know for me Just keep getting more excited exciting But Ali, I don't want to stop you have so much to share.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you want to share anything else at this point?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think actually what would be most helpful For the call that we're on is to hear from our friends in Africa What would be helpful for us if we were going to visit where should we go?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** we talk to what would be what you know what's on your mind right and I see also that we have Michael's hand up so maybe we can go to Michael and then back to and Karim I think as well yeah that'd be great yeah I just wanted to point out that a ruggy uh Marius hasn't introduced himself and I saw I think there's several other people so before we jump into all the other stuff let's introductions yeah but I know that Karim and they don't say have not in colombo hasn't either thank you stop sharing go ahead Karim thank you Ananda my name's Kamara Abdul Karim I'm from Guinea West Africa I'm the president

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of the NGO called the UT Evolutions, created in 2022 in Guinea and also I'm a founding member of Water Unity Networks with Elizabeth Heralds from California.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So actually we are working together to restore our watersheds because that's so important to figure out in my country where there is no protection for water and knowing that water is important and also is life.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we have actually built Water Unity Networks in Konakry, that's the capital city where we where we give access to clean and drinkable water to community for free via our water filters.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** using Sawyer water filters.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think you have already heard it or you can watch it on YouTube or Google.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And talking about youth evolution, the NGO I have created in 2022, we are working to fight against illegal immigration, which is killing and impoverishing the young people of Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also understanding that Africa is a continent where we have much more younger people, facing some crisis like liking of job opportunities, and also the lack of financial sustainability.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So these young people have choose to cross the desert of the oceans trying to find a better life in Europe.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That has a consequences, because we can mostly hear about human trafficking, yes, in that situations, like a prostitution of young ladies, and also the lose of lives on the oceans.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the most important thing is that we have started some projects in Guinea, which is based in cities and municipalities cleanup.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also water cleanups, like actually we are planning a project to clean the water of the lake in the capital city, which is called the lake of Somfonia.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the project is going much more better because we are organizing, and we have also included the local

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** authorities and the ministry of environment and also working with the community at least to build a community around that lake so that we can work together in the present and in the future.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mostly also the 70th of December 2024 as we are growing extending trying to build our community all over the country but starting first by Conakry and the town called Sangarredi where I'm born and actually we have a team there in the 70th of December we organized and executed a cleanup activity into some public public places which works well because actually we also have a community there but

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to get a working for the programs that we have, but as we know, we need funding to keep growing and to keep empowering our communities so that we can build a thriving life for everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much and if anyone has a question for me, so I have to listen.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I'll just quickly ask and then we can move on to Leon say.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kareem, you mentioned that there's sort of no protections for water.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How is water...

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** being damaged.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Who's using it?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What's the pollution source?

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is a good question.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The main thing to point out in this situation is first of all the miners, like the company or those who are exploiting the both sides and some other minerals.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We all know that these people are destroying the forests, the trees, and in the failing to replace and also to take care of the environments in general.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's one of the reasons we are facing the climate change climate issue.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also the same activities are destroyed in the water, the rivers, the lakes.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's understandable because there is a mismanagement of some issues around the environment, mostly everywhere in the world.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's important to bring adequate solutions for all those issues.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because our environment is what sustains us, is where we live in.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we should take care of it.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We should take care of what we live.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's the same for the environment, for the land.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because the land, we use the land to feed ourselves.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also, the people do not care too much.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not saying like everyone, they are still some people like it.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You and I, who are trying to save the planet, but some people don't care about taking care of the environment.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So by putting garbage into those rivers, into those lakes, so we end up having lakes and rivers which are destroyed.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's, you know, all the situations, turning around the region, the restorations aspects, because people are destroying the inner vulnerability.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and something has to be done for that.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you satisfied about the answer?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, thank you, and we definitely share your sentiments and are trying to think of how to support something to be done about the environment.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonce, please go ahead.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good morning everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can I speak in French?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I can.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can hear you Leonce.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The is very...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The sound is not very good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're much more positive than bad.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe my earphone is not good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you hear me now?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Still very noisy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very noisy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me try now.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you could write in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I say that my name is Mr.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leon.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Of I'm the national coordinator of our safety planet, NGO.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We work on restoration of ecosystems.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All our activities are based on restoration of water assets.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Activities are on livelihoods, the protection of environment and biodiversity.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we work on workforce and empowering women and girls.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's what the activities that we do every day.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm a member of the Water Unity Network as Karim said.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we work with Elisa in that organization.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you today?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm based in Gugma, East of the Democratic Republic of Korea.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think Flambeau, are you the last?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are we missing anyone?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Flambeau, are you I think you're the last.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Eurage Marius as well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then Marius is introduced.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you could close your microphone, you'll get a lot of noise.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What for me is for Leon's.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, Colombo, do you want to go?

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, excellent.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, let me go.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, let me just come with my name.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry, I'm out of the road.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, because by the way...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm travelling because I'm coming to Marara in the...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm travelling to Nakifale.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Marara, what is your question, please?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I just wanted to make sure everyone had a chance to introduce themselves.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's all.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I can't...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I don't...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know the more information to show about...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can send you the video because we do the video for all activities for the...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** years because you are 2024 and 28 for December we organize a celebrating all activities for our organization so I get the opportunity to invite all of the members of the era and the leaders Africa to join us because our activities they can get to present for the all members for all for all activity in all programs when we are in Maki Valley so if you get the time I can send the link we can join us and we can present just to say the presentation and get very very Christmas so for

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As for now, I get the opportunity in order to share the bio-rich projects because for now we get a certificate international certificate to sell the carbon.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we produce the carbon here and the manual gets the carbon.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can put the manual to support the activity of our farmers, refugees farmers and we have another project because we develop a project to purify the order.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the manual can get for the bio-rich, the carbon and we can put for the program of Zeota.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I can share for 2025 I can share the program and project of Zeota because we have a prototype and we can get more money to

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to support our project of the water.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I can share the program and I can share the project.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we need our support.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** need to see our things, skills to implement the project here in Naki Valley.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And for now, because I see Ananda and I see Diana.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I invited Diana because yesterday I she presents the project of Biotra here in Naki Valley.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because the project in Naki Valley gets, we started the project in 2021 and for 2024, we get a certificate.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the project of Biotra is a very big project and they demand all things.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm able to get the time to share the.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** information for Colombo and the Diana.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you need our information because we collaborate for bioenergy and the sake up seal and the open here.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you need all the information I can share with them.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would love to see that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I wanted to share something.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Which I think I have here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nope.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One second.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I just want to point out that we now have the ability to feature, for example, our African members in our directory.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But for that we need the information that I think Leonard is collecting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But if Leonard doesn't have your full name and your location and they

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** short bio please send it to him yeah okay and yes Colombo by all means please finish introducing yourself okay thank you and lean forward and shout yeah you're very difficult to hear you Colombo I don't know if you're far away or your microphone let me come closer my people now a little better yeah so I'm sorry but see maybe this time was my name this my Q valley louder yeah we've been working on this

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have to stay really loud, though, because you've fade.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me see.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's good.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's not working, Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you can write it in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just don't think it's going to work.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No problem.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me write it in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, John, how long does this meeting go?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've used all of our time for introductions, which is important, but I just want to...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How long do we have?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Just a few more minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Typically, it's a one-hour meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** On the other hand, we had a number of new people, which is great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm free for the next half hour.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** if someone has, I think, the next steps include getting everybody's name, email, and location, and getting them into the directory and onto a map.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard is helping with that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Leonard, I want to make sure you have Ellie's email address also, because she's going to try to build on that information.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, maybe I will share my email in the chat, then people can send me the bio and pictures, and we put them in the sheet.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And thank you for that information, Leon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's useful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if we have your email, but the point is we should all know what we all have, and we should all

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** we'll have it handy and that will be a big advance, including the location information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, Mara, I have the feeling you have some ideas about how to push this specific initiative forward.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think there's just so much potential.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I shared a couple of papers.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think there's tremendous potential and so many of us bring our own resources and our networks and our possibilities.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the idea of being able to come together as many of us as, you know, as possible to try to do some core work that would meet some foundational goals would be really great.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, my work is experiential learning, which is the idea of students doing internships or research or study abroad.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It can be virtual.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It can be in-person and there's just a tremendous growing interest both in the United States but also in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just got

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** back from Nigeria, where I'm working with a state to develop a curriculum.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the big idea is that projects that connect to sustainable development, climate action, regenerative agriculture are really exciting, but also then provide a platform to both showcase the work that many of you are doing, but also to build support, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the idea, big idea or one big idea is to use interest in education, experiential learning, engagement as a vehicle both to educate, which is important, but also to drive support.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if we think about the products that we could use, so visits to some of your locations, not all of them, but some of them, we think of a tool

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** or of this area, a virtual tour, because a lot of this can be done virtually, an in-person tour, yes, for students, but my work is more on educators, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Could be university folks, could be professors, could be people who want to come.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You think of ecotourism, but also doing good work, but also building capacity, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we start to think about the ways, many of you give talks, many of you give books.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Could that be a vehicle to drive some support, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like if all of the work that we do individually, but also to build collective impact, could then drive support for the regenerative agriculture, the sustainable development work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Could there be a collaborative or a collective that would create a vehicle?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I know Ellie has some ideas, and how could we leverage technology?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to do this.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I have a model where I support students to do remote projects and they engage with partners.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So all of these things could coalesce and rather than trying to figure it all out if it was possible to build some momentum around Ananda's trip that she's taking anyways and try to think out what would be some foundational deliverables that would help us write grants or do what we were going to do.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** storytelling, you know, digital storytelling becomes a vehicle in and of itself.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So imagine stories not just to educate and inspire but stories that then allow students to do projects, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Students that allow people to get involved.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so these are some of the ideas that are starting to purple.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if that made any sense.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ali, why don't you make sense of that for everybody?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think that was a great

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, so how I would summarize the conversation that Mara just shared and what we were talking about yesterday, which was very similar, is that we're thinking about how to kind of create an ecosystem ourselves, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have a lot of people in a lot of places, and we all sort of need to do the same thing.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everyone's trying to get environmental work done, and everyone needs resources to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the resources are out there, and Mara's model that she's coming up with is a really great way to access those resources and to bring more and more attention and understanding to the issues that we're trying to address with ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the question really is, you know, how do we organize ourselves and the materials and resources that we have to make a first pilot project and, you know, kind of go put boots on the ground, flush that out, bring back some materials that, as she said, we can use for grants and fundraising and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the sort of strategic thoughts that I have just on this call right now would be helpful to design around our, namely one, what material projects are happening.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I heard a lot of planned projects, know, I would love to know more about those details.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And more broadly, what is the goal, right, for people in Africa on the call with us, if we were able to bring resources, what would that look like for you?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Would it be helpful to have help on the ground from, you know, people that are able to work?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it more, you know, just getting the funds together?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are there logistical challenges?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, is it expertise and knowledge and sort of an ERA masterclass that Leonard mentioned?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, what is it that we would be able to bring to you that would be helpful?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I agree.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think that it's time for

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** inventory.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think Leonard is on that case now, right?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I mean, for example, Ember Leasy has just reminded us of what his projects are.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We have information scattered all over about this, but I think a single spreadsheet with our people, their projects, a description of the status of the project, and the location, that in itself, it's not asking a lot, but it's been very hard to collect, would be very helpful as we then try to, for example, look at what we might do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I also do think relevant to what Karim and others have been saying, that we all understand that there's great need for support for the people in these refugee camps, for example.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What's interesting about this model is that it may become possible for us to bring

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** money there, not frankly because we're doing the right thing from a humanitarian point of view, not just because those people need money, but because there are people elsewhere in the world who would be motivated to support eco restoration work on the ground, which will indeed improve lives there, and who might be interested in going there and working, or going there and touring.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And that will also bring money into the environment that is not available simply because it would be nice to help people who are in dire circumstances.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So we're looking for ways in which we can bring in new resources based on the theme of eco restoration, eco tourism, eco education that would supplement the obvious desirability of financial aid for people in these environments.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But to do that, an inventory of the projects and the people and the opportunities will be, I think, the next step.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see Leonard's hand is up.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** so much there, and Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just think what I was thinking is exactly the same thing that you mentioned.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wanted to share that I think we have a template, maybe people can use and there is one for my organization that we usually use maybe to collect data of the projects.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe everyone can fit that simple form and then we can customize it for a lot of we can remember to to give us the overview of the the projects that we have and then.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So far it's better that we have diverse projects.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** get water, deforestation, agroforestation, and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** then having that database would help help us in just fundraising or having a collective concept not for the broader African than we have the world.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** was that form letter?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe I can just, yeah, maybe I can share you the draft.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think not now, just I will send you an email because it's my organization is temperate, so then I need to remove some data in some sections, and.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it would be helpful if we could.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just to get like a visual so people know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What to expect if you wanted to share your screen and we'll we'll remember that it's not the correct form yet But you want me to share share yeah, just just everyone knows what the right document and they find it Okay, I think because I'm part of youth for nature that's the concept not that we use for You know correcting some projects from the members And let me see if I can find it Yeah, maybe you can just continue the discussion once I find it Yeah, just wanted to make some remarks You

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and collaborating and continue with this initiative.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think Eli or Eli your suggestion of asking what are the needs actually your people that are who want to collaborate things also here it's kind of important to make the distinction because there's some people that are from different countries and then also my question would then also be maybe what is the goal is this maybe to showcase collective impact as I heard for example so then my next question would then be then also because this then would pretty make a lot of sense to have a template where the organizations could put right down just in brief what they're to just so you have a picture of maybe there's some people working

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** also that people working on by the bus to and so on um or me personally um in this initiative I would I would continue in the case of Uganda that's where I would then specify um and narrow down um the potential also of the of this particular group especially with Amanda you're going to go there right I think the question um is maybe it can be some cooperative uh cooperative collaboration or potential collaboration basically happening and then for this I would just like to in to uh uh suggest to make a meeting with different organizations from Uganda that are only specifically focusing on regenerative agriculture or restoration and uh

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** just to keep it at that and then see if there can be some collaboration going on there as well.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The other one suggestion and then another one is to maybe also look at Hilo, because on Hilo there might also already be some information about some topics that are working on restoration work in Mexico, things that could be a base, maybe also to work with as well.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah those are great ideas and I'm happy to have you know more thoughts about sort of how to organize based on your experience already and Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy to have a conversation but I think just towards your broader question you know what we're almost seeing as the need is sort of an agency right to represent all the projects all the good work that's happening and on the ground in Africa and in other locations and to support

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** port with the resources that need to have to sort of develop those projects.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know, on one side, we need to inventory all of those projects and those partners.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we also need to fundraise and bring that money back.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in addition, support with the in kind knowledge, technical resources, right, like that sort of, you know, backup house thing.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, that's the big picture vision.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The biggest picture vision is that we recognize at ERA that we need to do a whole lot of reforestation, afforestation, and the rest of it.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we've got the sort of internal slogan 100 million projects by 2030.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you can imagine, you know, the scale that we're seeking to enter.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And indeed, technology systems like Kylo, which is probably a competitor for the thing that I'm building, but, you know, certainly more established right now, is a great place to start.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, if you have thoughts about groups,

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** connect with on Hilo or if you already have contacts, please feel free to send them our way or even to convene them on behalf of ERA as a of a node in our network.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I should love to.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unfortunately it could not be here.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll just throw it the last minute basically.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But yeah, maybe it's time to have a quick chat or something like that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Feel free to email me.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll drop my email in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, now I got the sheet.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** mean the document.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is this the

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the sign up form project concept note wfc yeah actually it's it's a sign up form it's it's a template for the project okay so uh everyone who needs to do a project at uh youth furniture you need to fill this and then so the organization can help you to fundraise so i was thinking that maybe this one would be helpful if we can customize it okay where you you just put the the title of the project and then the the each organization or a name uh this is an of a project i did in all the forest congress in south scoria last few years so then it has some parts you have to put the introduction on talking about what about the projects in short and then you put why why do you think the project is really important

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, because we have projects going on, course, we have, you know, we have a reason, why and the what and how.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then you just put the long term goals and short term goals.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** then putting the missions of the broader missions of the project.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then you put the, the, the targets of the audience.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, the, where you operate, if it is in Africa, of course we are in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then you may, we may put countries and whether if the project is virtual or personal or hybrid, you mentioned that it's very easy to feel.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** then you put the timeline and, and then you put the, the, the project details where you put budgets, for example, for two years, if these long term projects and then

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You put the materials that you need and if you need content creations like videos and whatever.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then here we have a template of how you feel the budget of the project is very easy as well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just we made everything simple.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then finally you put the monitoring and evaluation and the learning.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then yeah, everything is there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** it's just them to fit it.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think this is a great template.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you can send me the document.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would like to do is maybe have a call with you to plan how we would distribute this and get this filled out by everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That can be a project on its own.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I think there will be two goals, one of which is sort of the spreadsheet that John was describing.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Names, locations, projects, know, just sort of the who are you.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what are you working on right now?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we can also work more deeply with people who have active projects to fill out the template that you're sharing.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So let's arrange a call maybe for early January to kind of get on base about that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes ma'am.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I'll send you an email.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Leonard, be aware that simply putting out the form will not be enough.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You're going to have to grab people by the collar and say, can I get this information?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If it may take getting a call with them and then you type it into the form.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm not sure why it's so hard, but we have learned that building the database is step one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Step two is pushing people into it using whatever persuasion or hand holding is necessary.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can have parties of platform and WhatsApp.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What's that, Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The most successful platform so far is WhatsApp.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** People don't necessarily use the Google suite or even email.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But just about everybody does WhatsApp.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** good to know.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we'll investigate how to set up a pipeline.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We might be able to build some kind of system where someone could enter the information on what's happened and then it could go into a database.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we will definitely figure that out.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I see that Colombo's hand is up.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo, let's hear from you.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope now my more audible one.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can see you.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** so my suggestion is just a bit different.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because like some of us, we have

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we may need other resources like financial resources, maybe technical resources, like for instance, we are looking for an expert in the compost production because we already have resources, we are looking to have the resources, we are looking at components.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe throw the members on this call, if we get one person, say we are doing at least, we are really getting a right where not just because there are resources that we can make sure, but then we are doing is really part of the community.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe that could be another area that here, at least you could look at to support the existing researches by connecting them or leading them to the people that are close to make sure that the implementation is really meaningful.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I happen to know someone who is an expert in compost production, so what if we had that

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** person for you, who or how would you need to connect with them?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** this something like on Zoom or are you actually wanting someone to come physically to your project location and demonstrate how to do this?

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Zoom is enough because we are a team that will be working in the ground, just need the title to provide a room, then you can get into the ground, the people on the ground will be following whatever that is for you.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so do you have an email?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you drop that email into the chat and I'll try to see if I can sign in a compost expert for you?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We have one on the call.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wouldn't say I'm an expert but I know a lot about compost.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been making it for a very long time and I also have a good friend who is somebody that I

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** interviewed, profiled in my book who is a real expert on compost.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Which does demonstrate that asking the question, Colombo, is a real contribution.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's what we can help that way.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry I've been quiet, but then I've been following everything.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, we have a program in our language.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll translate it in slow.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Don't tell me that a drunken man can only hear one word.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All this business is just this world.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I must admit that I was brought up in an era of analog and you know technology is already

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I had Yang was requesting for the locations of projects and I've sent it to WhatsApp.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As Ananda said, most of us use WhatsApp because we were born in the early 60s and the computers were in America in the different means.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I've sent it to Ananda and you're please can you pass it on?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know how to put it in the chat here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here is the link.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here it comes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's in the WhatsApp group.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just mentioned I'm putting

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** link.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I created a new LinkedIn group that focuses on project design.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you're interested, I'm hearing that some of our partners are either doing experiential learning or want to engage groups in experiential learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the things that I've done in Nigeria that I'm trying to develop a model for is to go and partner and do institutes where I train educators, leaders in the project model, do symposia, then sort of help to get this seated in different countries.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'm developing a course and everything to go with it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if you want to join the LinkedIn group with other African leaders, we're working on developing this model.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's there too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Excellent.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Edward, is your hand up again or just still up?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's just you up.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, as I understand it, Ellie and Leonard are the organizational crew trying to pull all these pieces together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And thank you both so much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Jeffrey, I think is going to have lots of good input.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have his email if you don't have it.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't have it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, just wrote you, John and Ellie as well, but maybe it's easier to work with them, because there I can also put in the front of Uganda, and then we can have a presentation from there, it's easier to organize a shared meeting or something like that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's wish, maybe also ananda mohobu is going to be Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Geoffrey Kwala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's a good point.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So Leonard has been inviting people into the ERA Africa WhatsApp group.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But it makes me realize that when I ask people for their name and their email and their location, I didn't ask for their WhatsApp number.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's something we need to collect for everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I do think that is the obvious common denominator, even though I forget it all the time, because that's not where I live.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, maybe Leonard, do you, is there anyone that you need the WhatsApp number for to start a new group focused on Uganda?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And who would hear, who here would want to join?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it everyone in this group or probably not quite what everyone here is from Uganda?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are we sure we want to create yet another group?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do think it makes sense to focus on the project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, I'm thinking that there's, you know, there's a potential initial project that would be associated with a cluster of people that are in the same vicinity or watershed.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just as maybe a pilot, but at the same time, just to keep it inclusive for everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And perhaps thinking about a resource platform, I don't know if it's just.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the WhatsApp group or if there's some other way that we could share things like, you know, videos, slide presentations, curriculum, resources.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Platforms are not my area.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm having some, I have a team of learning designers.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have like a teaching and learning group that I'm in charge of and we're designing like off.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm just doing it as an online course, like a Blackboard course just to start putting resources in places by topic.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think it's ideal, but if that's of interest.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I do, I do actually have an app for this, not to sell my product, your product is designed for this case.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I guess I can show that if people want to see it now.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, let's

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- UB', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** if I can find the right link here.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But as I look for it, let me just kind of describe.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** this is so far actually has been developed for a scientist at NASA who, like many of us, have a lot of links to share with each other.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there's basically no place for, no sort of aggregated place for all of the different things that they want to share, which are links to presentations, slideshows, decks, you name it, they want to see it.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what we have is a basic sort of profile space where everyone has their own encyclopedia entry about kind of what they're doing, which is one of the things that we could populate to get the information that we're talking about with Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We also have the mechanism for people to share new specific information that can go both on their profile and also into a searchable database.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, what you end up getting is a knowledge base of all of the resources that people have shared into the platform, which can be tagged with various different notation like this has to do with water or this is related to this watershed or so on and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we need to change this a little bit from its current format, which is focused explicitly on NASA science to get it ready for folks in an ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what we could maybe do in the meantime is just get a PowerPoint deck and paste things in.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not ideal, but it's actually a great way to put everything in one space or a document or something like that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then my team can work on translating all of those files into an instance of the app for folks here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I am eager to have you allow us to use it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I appreciate you're selling it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We don't need to see it anymore.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We need to be able to actually kick the tire and make it happen.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I have pulled it up.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if folks want to see it now, I can show it and then we can work on getting it ready for everyone to kick the tires.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That would be fine.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** actually, it's 130, I've seen it before.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm sure we definitely need something like this and I'm eager to give you a test case for it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But in the meantime, I'm now copying some WhatsApp addresses from WhatsApp into Leonard's spreadsheet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We all have access to the spreadsheet and Leonard.

## 💬 Transcript

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, everybody, happy New Year.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Happy New Year.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Happy New Year.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hi, So, I thought I had this configured so that whoever got there could go right into the meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I guess you've all been stuck in the waiting room.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the host has to open the call in order for people to join.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I thought I had figured out how to configure Zoom so that wasn't the case.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Clearly not.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But wouldn't it be good given my unreliability if I could figure that one out?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll look into it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, very simple.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They were showing that someone is using the zoom.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't know which meeting was going on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, that's you know, I did configure it, but today I was trying to let my previous meeting continue without me.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Apparently the channel can't be reused even though you can.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it might be possible to have more than one call ongoing if you have two different rooms because there's the ability to create like you have your own meeting link room, which is always there.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But you can also book a time and get a different link for a special meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I, you know, I wouldn't have it under control.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do not.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What can I say?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So here we are.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Happy New Year to everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Um, what we've got four notepakers and I rejected one before I realized what the hell look at how much we have five

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, four note takers and four humans.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Leonard, thank you for, are you expecting anyone else today, Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think before we join, maybe I can send a message that we are starting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** My previous meeting was with a group.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Working with an organization in Rwanda called the world.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** W.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** F.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you gone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me just see.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** World Action Fund, Uganda, I don't suppose you're familiar with them, Colombo or Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here's a link to them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This was a meeting related to enable, but I was very impressed by their, with their leader and they might be interesting partners for our project as well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, wow.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's an agent.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, are we expecting Jeffrey, who you've now met?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, Jeffrey cannot make it today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Jeffrey also, he did come to the last meeting, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, I was impressed with him.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He seemed very well connected and very, uh, very committed.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, and we had a really

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** great conversation which might be interesting for folks here so I can I can share about that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Jeffrey Kuala who I hope everyone remembers from last time before the holidays which maybe we've all forgotten everything.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He had worked in Uganda with a startup that was doing regenerative sort of agriculture work and he is based in Germany and we just met to kind of go into more detail about the work he'd done and he had a great idea for our trip to Uganda in March that we actually organized it around a conference so he has connections with a lot of community-based organizations in Uganda who would be very interested to have a networking sort of facilitated networking and connection point and you know be willing to make a travel a trip of seven hours or so for that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we started brainstorming just a little bit about what that could be and landing

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** it on sort of a multi-strategy event where we could position this similarly to the work in Panama, which is sort of a nice repetition.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We could position this as an investigation in the country for strategy to support economic development around sustainable kind of methods and use the conference as a meeting point for seeing what the resources are, what the projects are, what the challenges are, know, share information and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then, you know, produce a report for governments, maybe even involve the universities in the conference and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there can be legibility around the work that we're trying to do and maybe even resourcing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's very interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And you actually think that might be something that could be pulled together in time for Mark?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so he's able to support the organization.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** he's got the contacts.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know, I think, of course, organizing an event in a country I've never been to is fun and ambitious, but he's been there and we obviously have people on the ground too.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I think if we, you know, pitch it as an exploratory conversation rather than like, here's the bells and whistles and, you know, expect swag, that it's very doable.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He indicated that the folks that he knows are very spontaneous in Uganda, so the short timeline is okay for them.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he also had some ideas about people that could potentially fund this as sponsors.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you know, why not?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's my thought.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you're, and listen, so that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's fantastic.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I'm actually really glad I wasn't on the conversation because I'm not going to be able to lead that charge.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If you and he think you can make it happen, I'm inclined to think you can make it happen and will support and participate any way I can.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have to announce that yesterday I decided I was not going to make it to Uganda in February, but now I need to announce that I'm not sure I can't not go to Uganda in March.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Because this this would be a really appealing situation.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, you know, my.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that that's the story.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have other commitments.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know that at the beginning of February, I'm going to be in Tucson.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I was home for the holidays and my 96 year old mother is pushing really hard to not be stuck in the city.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In February, she wants to go to Venice Beach, California.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And since I'm already going to be near Tucson, I began to think I would try to put this together.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then, of course, I have obligations at home, which say you can't be away all the time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So the timing, my involvement in timing are complicated.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I'm really very keen on what we're doing, and I think it's quite promising.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So especially if it's later in March, but I think that may be a problem for Ananda, then I might be able to spend a few weeks at home and then blah, blah, blah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it's just to say, I've got a lot going on, but I don't have to be there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I do want this to happen if it can happen.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it would be great if, because you've done the presentations on behalf of the State Department before, for you to at least, I mean, if we can connect with the government in some way.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I agree with that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Also, this call that I was just on, I think I mentioned this call that I was just on, was with this group in Uganda, this other group in Uganda, about Enable.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it's not at all implausible that the State Department might offer some resources, like a venue, as well as recruiting me as a speaker for either two presentations or a combo, etc.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Again, that's going to require, you know, I'm going to put you should look at World Action Fund Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The link is in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You'll see that they're doing a range of really good things and they seem to be quite together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, it's hard to come by.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so they also might be in a good position to reach out to the State Department and say, Hey, how about putting

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Something like this together.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I also met a couple of folks at the State Department last in December so I can follow up after the New Year and say, hey, we have this idea.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, let's let's try a few different means and see where we end up maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm working on a document with Jeffrey to delineate more structure around that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll share that and we can maybe meet early next week.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But since we have Leonard and I hope I'm saying this right.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Embleezy, is that how I say your name?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** an Edward on the phone, what I'd love to hear about, too, from from you is what would be interesting, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if we come to Ganda in March, what should we do that can empower you?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What should we know about so that we can support finding resources and so on?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** help us, you know, figure out how to be useful.

**{'display_name': 'MBILIZI KALOMBO', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's hard to hear your audio right up to the right up to the microphone or maybe here how about that makes a difference that's good yeah now it's back it's bad again you'll you'll have to stay really close to it unfortunately all right so in which district to the conference can't understand you yet yes in the chat

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Edward, yeah, he's, he, I think he's going to chat in the, in the, in the chat box.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I didn't realize you were here, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Happy New Year.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In which district will the conference take place?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a great idea.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** question we don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So let me respond to that with a little bit more context.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I've never been to Uganda and I think Mara has been and John, have you been to Uganda?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, so, so most of us have not been to Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're kind of blind and we, and we really don't know what would make sense to do.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there's kind of two big questions around logistics and, you know, location.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is where are people that are in ERA?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are the different, you know, the Edward Tamlett, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's other sort of land that people have.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where is that?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it possible and realistic to visit and travel to everyone?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's kind of what Leonard was helping us with when he started gathering information about everyone's physical location.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we can answer that question.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As far as the conference goes, now this is a bigger question because we wanna bring more folks into it and they're gonna be spread out.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the probable answer is Kampala because that's probably the easiest place for everyone to get to.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, you know, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Colombo, Leonard, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think for me it would be hard to give the answer because of course I'm not in Uganda so I'm in Rwanda but as Eric said I think Uganda would be better because like most of people who are traveling they stop in the city and maybe around near the city so maybe I think Uganda would be better for everyone to reach.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And in talking to this WAF person his name is Peter Odama.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He's got headquarters in Kampala also I think that looking at the map that does seem to be the obvious place and you you could argue that it's halfway in between Nakavali and the other sites that we're talking about.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Edward Pamlet and the Mazinga Institute I think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm looking at this other's Edward Tamla.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So Edward Tamla is quite close to Kampala.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think that makes it pretty obvious that it would be close to Kampala.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is 80 kilometers from Jinja city and the Chabazinga Institute is just some 30 kilometers from the Hamlet and the Chabazinga Institute is where I'm a minister in the Chabazinga Kingdom.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Chabazinga means the king and it's called the Soga Kingdom.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm delighted.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, I'm sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I came in late because it was disturbing me to click on.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think there was some problems but I would have loved to give me some more insight about the conference.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I joined when you had already talked about the conference.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Could you please give me some background conference on what in Kampala?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I love to so I mean it's also we're we're building this as we're flying the plane.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's a little bit open ended right now.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the the reason that we are thinking about a conference is because I just met with Jeffrey Kuala, who was on our area at Africa call last time and he has done quite a lot of work in Uganda in a previous role.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's now based in Germany, but he has a lot of contacts.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we just had a phone call just an hour ago, and he had the idea that we could bring many of the community based organizations that are doing work and similar kinds of regenerative work in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We could converge them and bring them together with a conference.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's his idea.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so the goal of the conference would be there'd be a couple of things that we want to do.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So one would be to provide enough like information and sort of material discussions for this to be an attractive place for the

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** community based organizations to come.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think just networking and meeting everyone else in the industry, right, would be useful.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what other kinds of conversations do people want to have?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How can we share best practices?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** know, it sounds like Edward, you have a lot going on at the Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you could speak about that, that kind of thing.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, so we want to make this useful for everyone that joins.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The other thing that we'd like to do is investigate sort of what the gaps are for the market, because as ERA is organizing itself, trying to figure out how to support more project work like yours in Uganda, and that means we need to know what you need and how to communicate that with others.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** part of this would be sort of an information finding moment for us to produce a paper, like a strategy around how we could make a super sustainable economic development plan in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we could maybe take that to Ugandan government.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** officials and try to get support for the work that you're doing we can also if that were to be successful we could also take that as a model to another country after that like Rwanda with Leonard and so on so we can start to build more understanding and more conversation around the things that we're doing right because that's where we're really going to get more support so the whole goal of the conference is to it's to kind of build community and build awareness we could also do you know media and and capture some information to bring back into fundraising materials and stuff like that so you know whatever ideas you have whatever things that you think would be helpful or useful you know now is the time to share that so we can build around those things.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah I'm very pleased to hear that and Ellie and Geoffrey Cuara thank you very much for that good initiative I'm happy to mention to you that

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've known Kuala for a long time and I've been working with him when he was still doing his PhD.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He came and here he visited the Hamlet, he knows the Hamlet, we have many pictures with him and he has been there for a long time, I've been in his contact and we, he came and stayed some two, three days in ginger and we have a consortium, the Uganda Palmer Council Consortium which started, he's really a very resourceful person and it's the one who introduced Hilo and we've been with him for coming close to four years now.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Essentially what he has mentioned to you, he had mentioned it some three years ago and it's good that it is coming, he was very busy in studies because he was presenting his dissertation, research while also building the communities across the country.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** country in all regions in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He mentioned that idea, but to me, what we said that we are talking about communities, we need to move nearer to the people than being in the city because I hope in Kampala, it's Kampala cities, like when you're talking of New York, whereas you're talking of the rural places, the communities in the outskirts.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ginger was a little bit prime because one, it's expensive in Kampala to host a conference and if you're bringing people who are struggling to leave, like we have no budgets currently for attending, but we have to attend anyway, but we can always look for a prime land and we walk the talk.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you're talking of the communities after the conference or when you are in the conference usually

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We always carry out field visits.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We don't have anywhere in Kampala city to go and visit a field.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been instrumental in organizing the, it was, it is called the adaptation.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It is a global movement which was started by IED in UK, whereby it brings the whole world in converging in one country to talk about adaptation, that means in agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And usually you have a conference of three to four days, but they have field visits.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They delegate splitting groups and you should have a host organization in that city or country.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the field visits are hosted at different sites.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And when people visit the field sites, they come back with their expectations.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Experiences in the field which means you have to hire some buses to take the delegates or participants Say if you're in New York, you can move to Arizona.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You see a farm regenerative center You appreciate and another one goes to another destination you can split according to the group and At the end you come and present what you've seen by sharing and you come up with one project So in Campana, if you talk of Campana unless it's urban regenerative farming or urban regeneration but too, Campana has got one good problem of traffic congestion From ginger to Campana it is 80 kilometers But it can take me eight hours to get there depending whether you will get to the comfort of the president or any ministers and it is congested But if you live outside

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the city, and you really move to the people, the core, the core of the conference.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would love to know the theme of the conference.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then from there we can decide.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know for those from Nakivale, it might be a little bit convenient for them to be in Kampala, but as well, we will not learn much in the buildings and the city center.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We needed to move and welcome to talk.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, so my question was, if you had a bus, if a tour was part of it, it's a naive question, but I'm going to ask it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Looking at the map, which I have right here, and I will share with you, is it conceivable that one could organize a tour

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm looking for my share button and it's not working.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, here it is.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bang, bang.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So what would be involved in visiting these four sites?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it realistic to be able to visit?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is, you know, does it take so long to drive that?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, that's the question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** it's eight hours from Kampala to Ginja.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was giving an example that you can leave to Kampala, but there is some way in metropolitan Kampala, from Mukono to Kampala, there is a very heavy traffic jam.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Two, wait a minute.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** as proposing because we are talking of ecological restoration and we are talking about regenerative farming.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are talking about regeneration of the soil.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What is the prime center to set the scene?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Should it be in the middle of the desert or should we go to the rural communities?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, let's suppose we go to the rural community.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** is the scenario?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are you saying come to Edward Tamlet?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not saying that we come to Edward Tamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can set an area which is near some centers which we kind of visit because we need some field visits.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And by the way, when you we get people like the area to get people from Rwanda, we get people, you know, we can have one case study

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we visit that.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then we come up with a project which will be, we come up with some solutions because that will be the model we're going to use.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because we are not perfect in what we are doing but we are trying.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We need to have a standardized model which we are going to adopt So I completely agree that we are looking for a model that's repeatable but I am really nervous about logistics in rural areas in Uganda and in Africa because we have no experience with that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I know that it's going to be a surprise right and sort of difficult to arrange.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what I think for this first conference which is super ad hoc, we just created the idea an hour ago, we should probably go to Kampala because everyone knows how to get

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** there.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then after that point, when we have the connections, we can figure out in the future.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** even when we're in Uganda, we can figure out how to organize field visits as part of the ongoing plan and standard template from ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I absolutely agree with you that these things are important.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I live in Arkansas, which you probably haven't even heard of.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's pretty far from New York.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the logistics right now, I think, is just more than we can definitely handle.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also make sure that we do something that looks very interesting to the government until one.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We want to do this at a very professional level to get credibility and delivering logistics in Africa is not, we're not ready for that right now.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I perfectly agree with you because I think the main objective of this conference is to interest the government and know what is being done.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** right and all the government offices in Kampala because we will also have to invite some dignitaries from different stakeholders like Minister of Finance.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I had some time yesterday but one that they have some climate finance and adaptation funds but they don't mention it.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And two we should also organize in such a way that much as there is no logistics but we should also include this is the experience of the getting globally.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I attended the World Bank conference in Jamaica.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I attended in Colombia recently.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was in Japan for the same UNESCO.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was in Copenhagen but we need to have some we put you factor in that we have to pick one which will be just close

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** which we can visit as a study case for drawing our conclusion and drawing up a model because as you talk I was talking of regeneration before I went to Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Whereas I was almost just nearing to zero, you know we have a proverb in our language that someone who has never traveled will always praise her mother or his mother that she knows how to cook not knowing that even John Shul knows better how to cook so if you taste John's food you can where you can now compare your father so or mother so I think we factor in that I'm sorry to have climbed on something which was already discussed a few days ago but still I'm okay with that because we need the government to be on board and we yeah and and what we might do again because this is our first time and we and we ourselves have to learn like

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I love that you're comparing us to the World Bank and UNESCO conferences, but we don't have quite as much resources as they do yet.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we have to understand ourselves, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so this first visit, maybe what we can do is organize a field trip for ourselves, where if, you know, we miss, we figure out logistical problems on the way it's not as big of a deal as like with a busload of people.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what I would love to do is visit sort of everyone that we can get to the four points on the map that John shared and then bring that information back to report to the government dignitaries, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the conference could be later in the month after we do some field visits.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It doesn't satisfy your goal of helping people to connect with the actual land.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we can work on making that happen in the future after we first just kind of get our feet wet and understand, you know, what it takes to put on an event like this.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to hopefully that that is good enough for now.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can keep talking.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of this, but I know Colombo had something that he wanted to share and Leonard also has his hand up, so let's hear from them and then we can keep talking about it if we need to.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you, Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope now we're more audible.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so I think my opinion was like, Ellie, I think you already know where these commit based organizations are.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, some of them.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It should be maybe important to look for a central location.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe most of them I know that Uganda, we don't know.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then having the conference in Kampala could maybe be harder.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If most of those commit based organizations that we're targeting, I know that Uganda, but I think the biggest thing would just be where we have very many partners.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If for example, they know that Uganda, even Northern Uganda, we also have some other cities that can host the conference.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have hotels, they have conference rooms, no suiciding in Kampala, but if for example,

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're coming from different parts of, from different regions of Uganda, Kampala could be the same location.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think for me, first I didn't find where many of them were, could be the first step.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if we are just looking at the old, okay, the community based organization across the country, Kampala could be the ideal location.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, as a, as a, as I was hearing the conversation, we also have to organize something like the field visits, especially for partners now.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's one could be because all of us, all, we know hemilates, but you don't know what they do.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We don't know how it looks like.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's could be like this.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** After, after you finish everything, that's going to be like something to think about having partners.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And because we have those, like, for example, if you come to Machiavelli, we are three partners already in Machiavelli.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And for us, we are just nearby each other.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is we, there's Marias, there is...

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've forgotten the lady.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** but you can also sort and then you see, based on the logistics that we should be having, then we can sort some partners to visit, but we have to be having the conference in a central location.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's would be my opinion.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I love your feedback and I would very much welcome your guidance or expertise on the logistical planning because, you know, as John shared, we have a Google Maps and it looks like it's not far, but that's not always how it is when you're on the ground and trying to drive.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what, so maybe we can coordinate around, you know, how do we do the field visit?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are ERA locations?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** are the people that we don't yet know, but we'd like to know, you know, what can we feasibly and realistically do and visit?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How much would it cost, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like we don't know yet what we're going to decide, but we can start to do that investigation and then make the decisions.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's one thing.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the field visits are going to be more internal with, you know, John and I and...

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mara and anyone else that can that can make that and then it sounds like we have a conference after that which might be separate.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe there's two conferences.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe there's one for community based organizations and that could be in Kampala if it's central or it could be somewhere else that's that's convenient to to those groups as you've mentioned.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do think it's important that we have something in Kampala because that's probably where the seat of government is right.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so maybe we do this fieldwork.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We do this sort of meet and greet with other peers and then we take all of this as findings and we report back to the government.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe it's not even a conference.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe it's a half day right where we just sort of let them know what we found.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All of those things could be possible.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's helpful to keep hearing these ideas so we can kind of converge on what makes sense to do.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard do you have a thought.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just wanted to.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** echo what you all said, but I think I would like to bring some experiences with hosting events in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe I would give one, I was in part of the team, which was preparing the Africa, but specifically Youth Leadership Forum, which held in Kenya last year.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think because it's kind of restoration conference.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Of course, it's important to consider what Edward was saying.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's always important to have something to visit.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what we did was to set the conference, the discussions, workshops and everything, the talks in Nairobi, which was in the city, because I think it's easier for any person to travel to the city because most of the time cities are in the center.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you know, you cannot do the center.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and know where all community-based organizations are located.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's really hard, and I think it's very easy for me to travel to Kigari when it comes to my country, because everyone feels like the city is the center.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very easy to travel there, which should be hard maybe from west to the north, if I want to go to the north of the country.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But from west to Kigari will be very easy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think that's what I want to say, but also for doing the visit, I think what we do is we map where we want to visit, which is near the city, and then hiring a bus, and then people go to the bus, to the field, we visit, and then we come back to the city.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that will be very easy than anything else.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's how we did, it was really amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I know there are some initiatives that should be near the city, not too far, where you can travel by the bus and come back to the conference venue or to the hotels in the town.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think that would be possible and easier.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you think, Leonard, do you feel confident that you would know how to find a bus in Uganda?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you took that responsibility, could you do that?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not sure, but what happened is that I think they have really big buses.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What you do is you hire it, maybe per one day, then depending on the number of people that you want to carry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If there are so many, you need two buses, but what you do, you hire a bus and then the bus carries you the full day.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think transportation is not too expensive when it comes to bus users.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe we can collaborate with colleagues and then see if it is possible.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The main that would be hard for us in organizing this now is that we only have the internet, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know, you know, anyone that I can call to get a bus in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if I search on the internet, I don't know what I've found.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's easy to get into weird things, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because they know that I'm not there.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's kind of the question is if we can figure out what the right things are and get that negotiated and understand how much it would cause.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because we also need to understand how to paper this.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be the work that's necessary to be able to offer something like that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I got you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if maybe Colombo or others cannot help, maybe I can consult my friends in Uganda and see if we can find it.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, great.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think, Eddie, don't worry about the buses.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the pool of buses which were used for Chogam and there are very many at Uganda parliaments.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They are there for hire and very executive VIP.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can hire a bus for 20 mini bus for 25 depending on the participants and they'll know the conference how many you've been invited because I think we should have been done early too.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You need to have a FOCO organization to organize and coordinate all this.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You don't have to worry about being in the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** or Canada to do this.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hosted one time an international conference for Sweden, the Swedish International Development Agency which sponsored my studies in Sweden and we had regional conferences.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You just have to enter random with an organization that does all that, that you get us a venue

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** how much, get us modest accommodation for international participants, hotel pickups, I think even Netherlands have got a form which they feel in you can also get a number of hotels that are not expensive because we should live by example we shouldn't go into five-star hotels for what?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** When you're talking about net-zero we shouldn't move we have to use eco-friendly places.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm so glad that you have so much information about the logistics and it would be really great if we could figure that out maybe Leonard helped to kind of do a survey of what knowledge we already have since I know that I don't have any and what I'm really good at is writing reports not organizing things on the ground I mean I can do it it's what we need to think about our resources right so I can always get you all the contacts where we

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** whatever you want, I give you a list of 20.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then we also get a list.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, let's get a list of those providers like the buses, we can use the government buses and we also some some people and you can't talk of visiting Uganda early when you don't even have to have some time off to visit Rivner and Lake Victoria.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know that you will be happy to plan our expeditions to the countryside and we can talk more about that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know we also have only eight minutes left on the call and there's three people with their hand up.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's let's convene more on that offline but should we go and order for lunch?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm gonna say this wrong.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm sorry, follow the show.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** was easy.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What is it, Dayo?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, Dayo, please feel free.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, good evening, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good evening, Joan.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Happy new year.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Happy new year.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** evening.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, I came in late, so I don't know what this is.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** sessions all about, but it's what I can observe.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think John is planning a movement like a report to Uganda or Kenya, which is the eastern part of Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I wanted to know, is it limited to eastern part of Africa alone?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or are you still looking at the west Africa as well?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't want to, I'm not trying to go any, I'm just trying to like, okay, is it after you're done with east Africa?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is there any plans for west Africa, for Hossier as well in Nigeria to have a wonderful team of my people right here in our country?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just want to tip you, is there any plans of such in nature?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I mean, hopefully we have a successful conference in Uganda and we get lots of money and we can do this again.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We would love to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Whether there can be that is based on resources and, you know, things that have to happen that we don't know yet.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the idea of taking this as a model and bringing it to other countries is absolutely

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what we're trying to plan and build, you know, the big picture vision is, you know, how do we put 100 million projects on earth really fast?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what that requires us to do is, is activate a lot of people and a lot of networks, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yes, we would love to also be able to do this in West Africa and South Africa in, you know, in Latin America all over.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But to do that, we're going to need people on the ground who have access to resources.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For instance, you know, the list of bus contacts that Edward can find, that kind of thing is really important.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As well as resources from some other place, maybe that's a government, maybe that's international funders, we have to figure out what that looks like.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But let me also say that once I'm going to that, to that part of the world, if, for example, the embassy in Nigeria

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** wanted to invite me to get some talks there and they would pay for it, I could imagine going from this event in Uganda and stopping in Nairobi, meeting you, meeting your colleagues and giving some talks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** don't know if I mentioned this, Dale, but I am an authorized State Department speaker and that means that you could get the local embassy in your country to invite me to come and give some talks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If you want to discuss that, I happy to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The whole timing and the whole question of my availability is complicated, but frankly, we are clearly trying to wrap our heads around several different propositions and it hasn't all coalesced yet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We are just going to have to keep on brainstorming until it gets clear exactly we are talking about.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Colombo, your hand has been up for a

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, John.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I would have to be very brief.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, my suggestion would just be one.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If at all we want the conference to be practical, rather than very theoretical, I remember Warrant Brush is the ecosystem of US aid in Uganda, but operating in Northern Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So for them, they have a center already with each and everything set, a generative center.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think, okay, the problem is only because it's in the north and some of us are in the south, but they already have everything.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So with that, we have some good network and some good connection with him, which maybe can have, like he can avail maybe something like the accommodation and the conference room, plus other things.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if we want to do it very theoretical, maybe we could look to compare what is in the

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But again, to add on what Edward has mentioned, to come to Uganda, think someone has to be there for the conference to organize.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I suggest that Edward could take the lead in that because it's near by the city.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he has some good connection with the different governments, authorities and the officials.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think it could be better if you could extend this conversation with Edward so that you can get a clear picture of the logistics and the whole planning in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a great suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will certainly do that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** USAID is also a great contact.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What we can do is once I have a document written up, we can give that to you and you can try to share it with them and see if they're interested because they may also be willing to fund or to sponsor, which would be great for us in Uganda and also that could help us go into other countries as well with USAID support.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we should definitely

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** only follow up with that connection as well.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Elizabeth?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're still talking about March for this event.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is that correct?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what we are thinking about now is actually organizing a conference.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have a contact named Jeffrey Kwala who has previously done work in Uganda and maybe even it sounds like part of his PhD work.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he has a lot of connections with community-based organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So he suggested we bring everyone together for a of a network mixer that could also be a space where other events are done like organizing a cleanup or something like this of like Victoria.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So just to not complicate things but to answer Dayo's question, Usman is having an event in Senegal in February, I believe.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A fairly large event.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can look into it more, but I think he is doing something in February.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if it's something that the ERA wants to look into more, but I'm pretty sure.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's a good bit of gossip.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We should know about it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll approach him and see where it's at.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then in terms of sort of logistical planning, are we going to use this call for sort of the working group for organizing this?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If so, I would almost suggest certainly at this first part to have it once a week rather than every two weeks, March will come up quickly.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so that's just a suggestion there and also would like to.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** offer.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do have a logistical experience and some working remotely in Guinea by working with Karim, but really we've done a couple things there and so really having someone on the ground is really important and not relying on our experience but really have somebody that we trust that and and certainly I trust everybody on this call to be able to do what we need to do if we can get the vision clear and the pathways clear.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm pretty sure between Edward and Mimbleezy and Leonard and I also have Okelo who's in Kampala working going to the University so we could also maybe see if we could pull in the University as well.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that would be, I think that would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that would be a good way to kind of achieve sustainability.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mara also has, who's not here today, but she has a lot of contacts at universities too.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think, you know, it's the call time to answer your thoughts about sort of how to move forward.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we have enough clarity around what we need to figure out that I can set a doc about that and we can schedule a call.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think Leonard's idea that we should have a different working group instead of just this call is a good one because, you know, sort of everyone in Africa comes to this call.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what I can do is host that call.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, do you want to maybe take the the job of figuring out what time and what day works for people to be able to do that and who wants to join the working group?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would say what we're looking for specifically right now is the people in Uganda who want to participate.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also, if

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone else is interested in this model for like West Africa or somewhere else, you're welcome to join and share ideas.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we, you know, make sure that the model is robust, but mostly it will just be focused on actually, you know, figuring out how to get this done in this one conference in March in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Leonard will probably organize us after the call on what's up.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you want to be part of this working group, let him know, and I will send out a document hopefully this weekend, if not earlier, and we can all start talking about that in our next call.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I do want to say, Edward, it sounds like you have a fairly clear vision and some experience.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** would.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One thing we haven't talked about is given if it takes eight hours to get from.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Two points one is if it takes eight hours to get.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** from Kampala to Jinja, that suggests that this whole trip is going to have some duration that we haven't specified yet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Obviously, it's not going to be a day trip.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's going to be some number of days, and I don't have a sense of that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Secondly, I do want to remind us that I think Ananda is committed to going to both Etrus Hamlet and Nakavali.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so, depending on how the timing of that works, that may provide some helpful constraints in figuring out when and where we would actually begin to focus our attention.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's all I got.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The other thing I'll mention, that's it for now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm done and we're late.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's right.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me put clear the eight hours.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was giving you the eight hours, is that from the airport up to, say, Jinja, because

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I left Canada last month.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** arrived at 2 p.m.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and I go to ginger at midnight.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There a big jam.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it was because of the presidential, you know, convo always uses that trip.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they always put you at a standstill.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But there is another bypass and express highway, which one can use too.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Whenever we plan a trip, there is another escape route, which is not in the city centre.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So when we are planning, we plan the hotels and the trip.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And for ginger, like the hamlets from Campala, when you use that route, it takes just around two, three hours.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** when you're outside also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, that's very helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Edward, I have a feeling if you want to put together a proposed event for us, where you fill in all the blanks and you say, here's what I would

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** recommend if you're willing to do that I'm sure it would be helpful for us especially if you don't take offense if we say that's not what we want to do but it would be very helpful for someone who actually knows the region to say if I were you this is what I would recommend and I would welcome that input yeah I think I'm happy accepted I mean acceptance with your proposal and I can give you a very good program because one I I concur with the early that we be in Campala because all the seats and the government officials we want to meet in this first meeting conference a station there and I can also help in inviting some of the key stakeholders given the fact that I'm also someone from the king from the kingdom and yeah I can give out a clear picture

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** even before some two three days we can it can be a back and forth then you can pick from what I can propose just a simple one timeline of just three four days I can come up with one as long as I know the objective of the the conference the theme then that will help me to pinpoint other stakeholders and also to meet the government officials for us we meet them because in the in Uganda a culture institution is the most revered institution than a political party so being that I'm a minister I can use that post to I know very many people in the government that is the good thing great that's cool I think so the theme the general theme area is strategic development of sustainable economic industries which includes an environmental restoration component but that's not how we frame it we are talking most

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** about security, food security, national security, you know, sustainable livelihoods, all of these things that countries want to achieve, what we're offering is technical expertise to come in and do that strategic analysis so we can make recommendations specifically to support, you know, resources that would provide more infrastructure support for gadgets like the Hamlet and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So- come up with that concept.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What's that?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The concept you have, then that will get me through to give you good recommendation and also getting the keystick, the participants.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We need the government to be inclusive.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can get one from the vice president's office, prime minister's office, the government, and the parliament as well because we need those strategic partners.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it would be very helpful also the next time we talk to get feedback from you about what's

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What kinds of conversations would be interesting to them?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How we should approach what we should ask for if we want partnerships.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, what would it is it a program?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it a commitment?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it, you know, what would be helpful for us to organize on our side to bring to those stakeholders?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think I will help you to identify the, because you are by chance that my boss, my immediate boss is the executive director and national planning authority of Uganda, the chief plan of Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he's just the neighbor to the hamlet and I'm working in his minister, in his office because he's the prime minister of Soga Kingdom and I'm his minister, General duties in his office, the prime minister's office.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are really connected.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so talk to him and tell us what he wants and what

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah?

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No meeting today?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think there is no one in the hall.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Alright, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, no problem.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So...

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so if there is no meeting today, then we'll catch up later for a new meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Karim', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, John.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, are you?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm fine, aren't you?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Too many things all at once.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you now?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm back in Rochester.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And unlike you, I'm not about to embark on a big trip.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How's your planning going?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, there's a forecasting a rather big snowstorm on Sunday, so I'm a little anxious that that might interfere with our getting out, but keeping my fingers crossed.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Got a big suitcase full of stuff that people want me to bring them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll let you do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll let you do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Have you been coordinating with any people outside of our WhatsApp groups?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh, Moses?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mhmm.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, I'm going to go to, um, Kenya to visit Moses, uh, after the gathering at the, uh, Jinja.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My God, look at all these note takers.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm surprised you see them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you see them?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I've removed many others.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I see.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, they're gradually dropping out.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How does Karim get in there?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't think I approved Karim.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Uh, you know, I think it's time to write to, uh, Zoom and say, look, you need, you need something.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, also to people that attend the meetings that, I mean, we should have a file with meeting notes that are recorded and not need everybody to

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Their note taker and then solicit everyone to sign up for their particular note taker service at the end of every meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello again.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're talking about all the AI bots?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, we're out these days.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There ought to be a system.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They need an AI system for the AI bots.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's just going to go around and around and around.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They seem to be extremely popular in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** More meetings than any other meetings.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wonder what people do with them.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** guess you can...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What are you guys talking about?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm curious.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're talking about the onslaught of AI zombies to record these meetings and the need for...

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm just sharing such a meeting and it's true that the AI zombie that I unwittingly unleashed on the global ever greening alliance came through Leonard and it's read dot AI unbelievably and I took it up with the company and I said you're headed for a lot of lawsuits you have to sort this out and I think I told you John they said.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Why would we wish to come into meetings in which we're not invited we would never do that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That was their final answer to this huh.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The thing of it is that every single one of them sends an email to all the participants of the meeting afterwards and if you want to read the notes you have to sign up for an account.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Excellent I don't think so.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No I don't think

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, but I mean, I don't want to sign up for a gazillion different accounts like, um, I really like the just getting the notes straight from your Fathom thing and not having to sign any accounts.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a perfect example of a predatory model.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** believe.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, I mean, usually these free models are getting something right, like the fact that you're interfacing with them is all data.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And some people sign up for paid plan.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have found them on a paid plan.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Inviting people to the meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's just make sure he's inviting them to the same meeting we're in.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I did want to say about AI before we just.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They do have significant energy costs as you've pointed out.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But he gets an email that has carbon and energy costs and material costs.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, here's Ross.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, here's just one of the checks.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're on Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, he's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I was afraid people might be gathering the wrong meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, do all of my North American friends know each other?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Who are on the call?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think we've met, have we?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I don't know Mara yet.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ross.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Mara is from University of Buffalo.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know Phoebe Farah at Petit.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, there you go.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** University of Buffalo, Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What's your field?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, so I'm a cognitive psychologist by training, but

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I work in instructional innovation, I focus on project-based learning, I do some innovation around that, but I lead our new instructional innovation team that's integrating Gen AI with instruction throughout the university.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's lovely, and I have questions about that, and one of these days we can have a conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would love to, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm just a biodiversity and climate scientist working on vulnerability, adaptation, conservation, restoration, and the crossroads of humanity have been in for 34 years and returned to the US about eight years ago.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh my goodness, where in the US are you?

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The far northwest, Pacific Northwest, so I'm up about an hour from the Canadian border halfway down the island, Vancouver.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It looks like

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John and you know you've collected quite a few interesting people from New York State, which is great.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're glad to hear that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to Well indeed, Maura and I go back to the enabled days.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've recently rejoined in EcoRestoration and apparently AI as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Aston and the Amokama.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi guys.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm just wondering, did you check the link that Leonard is sending?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** did and it is the same link.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's not here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And yet he's not here.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Having worked with Leonard for a while, know that he's for several years now, I know that he's sometimes struggling with connection and coverage, but that he usually does show up.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you want me to text him, John, so you can- No, I just did.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just did.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Russ Mara and Phoebe is the guy who knows the guy in the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He seems to know lots and lots of people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We call him the Great Connector, but he's been with biodiversity for a livable climate for quite some time and with us for quite some time.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Russ, I think you were the guy who, for some time, used to send me emails that were intended for another Phoebe.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Phoebe Sweeney.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Coach Ati Pueblo the Coach Ati Pueblo in New Mexico.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's actually a hydrologist with a favorite of the state and also of Los Alamos Labs and a very good friend.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of ours, Jeff Goble.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm getting better.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** haven't sent you an email by mistake for a while.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, and I'm glad that we're finally working together because I had a sense that we would, anyway, it's come to pass.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in the meantime...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Phoebe, Phoebe, could you tell me and presumably some other people like Mara, about your 34 years in Southern Africa?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you were in several countries, I presume?

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Namibia and South Africa mainly.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I also worked in East Africa for shorter periods, running field tropical biology courses in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I was mainly working for the governments of Namibia and South Africa and universities, setting up and leading

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** national scale programs in biodiversity and climate change, earth observation systems and national development.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I, I set up Namibia's first programs on biodiversity and climate, but did a lot of training of young professionals too.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's, you know, perhaps more of identity these days.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, being conscious of Estyn and Bayu Makama being here, wonder, because I don't have the agenda, I wonder how we could make this time and their data costs most helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, our usual moderators are not here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I'm happy to step into the breach.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Estyn is on our board of directors of the Eco-Restoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I don't think I know

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** will be Yama Kama or M.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Takani and M.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Takani, would you like to go first and introduce yourself?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I invited Takani because he is working in Kukuma Refugee Camp doing projects really similar to the projects that we're focusing on in Nakavali.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you can, if you're able to speak Takani?

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I'm currently not glad to meet Takani because I've heard of them by reputation for some time through Ananda and others, so I'm delighted to be in the same room.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well it's wonderful because we have quite a few people in Nakavali that are doing different projects, and I think the more we can pull together similar

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** work in different places and different refugee camps that will be really nice to pull these initiatives together and see how we can't help across the board.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And how great is it that Ananda and Eliza or is it just Ananda will be going to Nakavali in a week or two?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just me going to Nakavali, Eliza will be going to Edwards Hamlet and Will Bendy for the Flip Town Gathering.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm glad to hear that.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** May I just say, John, you and I have discussed this before, I think it's a really encouraging commonality between many of the region.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I didn't ask my thing to go like this, but I guess just articulating made the surveillance

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** camera generate that.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The commonality between so many of the restoration initiatives is to what extent can restoration camps play a positive role in climate migration and refugee resilience and resettlement and skills development.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm really happy to see that happening nicely here.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Indeed, and that is sort of why we're here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're doing introductions and catch ups.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Dayo, how are you and your new family?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Dayo had a child recently and some medical complications.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm hoping they are now resolved.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe I will remind the members from Africa to to first there is a group a small group that is aiming to continue drafting the strategy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think people didn't join.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are three now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If people can join, if you feel like you have something you want to contribute to our strategy, you are welcome.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a very short time taking.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard, I wonder if you can also give us a read-only link to the spreadsheet that summarizes the information that is already in the ERA Africa database.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** When people fill out the form, it goes into a spreadsheet of some sort.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If you could give that and

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** and add it to this four-part message that you have.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it would be helpful for people to see how many people have expressed an interest in how many people we are beginning to bring together.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I can even share that now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Zamkama, can you hear us?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm working with the Batua community in a local organization called the Morality Community Initiative that is working around the

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** being in Penetribo National Rupaka, mostly in the southern sector within Xoro district to Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is a few about to me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Be aware that Ananda is going to be coming to Uganda in the next week and so if we get your contact information maybe there's an opportunity for a face-to-face encounter.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is very nice and I would be happy to meet the Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well there's going to be gatherings in Nakavali in Jinja and in Mulbendi.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if it's possible for you to make it to any one of those gatherings.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I can be happy to be in that place because I know as I move, I would just get a route for my people, it would be good to meet you there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Africa is a very big place, but we have gotten a number of people within a fairly well-defined geographical area, and I think we ought to be able to do some interesting things together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard, have we now arranged for you to be joining with Amanda on this trip?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, no arrangements have been made.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we have agreed that it's possible, so maybe we'll talk about that in the next meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** At 2 o'clock, the group specifically about the around the group will be will be convening that's in an hour and a half.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so, can you allow me to share my screen and share the spreadsheet that you mentioned?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so, yeah, is.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, maybe I can share this in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** guess, but you want to share the, I think a read only link.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We don't want it to be edited directly.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's looking quite fleshed out.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But, and it's 14 people, whereas the.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A of people invited to this meeting might be different.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Anyway, we are we are getting there and making progress.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And it's great building a community.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have a question.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I've tried to open the link.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I found some.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, some social media.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't have.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm not using them like excellent YouTube link and for me to submit that they are it is compulsory for me to feel them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, how can I feel them?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can't figure it out.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Those links should not be compulsory so we can work on that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, we are.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Go ahead.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was saying I will figure it out after this meeting, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, feel free to join our WhatsApp group for Apple Days.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think like Niascio and the others, sometimes they ask me to send links in the box.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it would be better if you join the Africa-wide group.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be easier for us to communicate.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you have any updates or anyone so that we can share some updates on what we are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure, I'm happy.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you speaking about Nakavali or there's a lot going on?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What would you like to hear about?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe Nakavali or any Africa-related projects.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can share a little bit since there's some.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** new faces and I'm going to have to move to my my car cell phone soon.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I focus on connecting students with virtual projects and I do that at the University of Buffalo is our base but we're experimenting all over with this and the idea is that students connect with partners who are doing the work of restoration and the students gain knowledge and they get to develop skills and competencies but at the same time the partners on the ground are providing in situ data as they are working on their own restoration projects and so we've been experimenting with the projects connecting with climate data and using data analytics to both learn but then also develop more projects and that's something that we're working on at the

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** university at Buffalo.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know Colombo is part of this group, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo has been working hard on the lots project and has been gathering data, satellite mapping data.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we're eager to see how to connect.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we also noticed on one of the earlier calls that you have a number of members around Lake Victoria.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're very interested in sort of this regional grouping across Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya and starting to think about the value of starting to map some of the restoration projects.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was sharing with John, I've been really excited to play with AI and see that you can map retroactively.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if you have a project that is growing and

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and you're seeing some positive early impacts, we can actually look backwards over time, over data, Phoebe's gonna be able to talk about this much better than I, we can actually go backwards and then see some of the early results and project forwards to start sort of seeing how we can learn and pick up some of these thriving signals that are happening.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm really excited to work with some of the partners to try out some of these approaches and that's sort of where my work is at the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then there's the new group.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so thriving, know, we're looking at ecological restoration but the same approach can work on other forms of sustainable development.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A little trickier to look at thriving metrics but I have been working with a state

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in Nigeria to completely redesign the basic education curriculum all the way from pre primary up through vocational and tertiary using this project based learning approach and we've implemented it for a year and run school and have seen really exciting.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Impacts and now it's being integrated across the whole system.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I have a research grant in we're finalist.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know yet with Spencer to really look at this research approach of using narrative data human data about life and how things are impacting life as well as climate data, satellite data and using these projects.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As a way to move things forward.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, lots going on.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would say Nigeria and then my partners in East Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** trying to understand the climate restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But there's a lot of exciting things and through John and through ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm meeting brilliant people who, you know, through collaboration, I think we can move pretty quickly since so many exciting things are going on.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope some of that made sense.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Probably not much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Not much.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pretty much.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much, Maya.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe, for lunch, you have something to ask.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can I go on?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just heard you call Nigeria because when you were calling Uganda, were calling Tanzania, was like, have we done again this time around that you're not calling Nigeria with the West Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you call Nigeria and tell us about the, when I heard Nigeria, I said, good, good, good.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that has a good one.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And about the project you're talking about, here I am in the North East, Nigeria, Taraba State.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've not had any of the similar such work here.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was wondering when you said you've been doing something of such nature.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe I've not been connected to the right set of people that are together because I did a similar work for Allah Foundation UK to get the data information that we carried out a, was it a research work about, still about smart agriculture here in Nigeria, also about a reforestation project.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we've been doing a lot and we don't know, I would say I'm open to collaboration and also to help you to meet some people that we can work together.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have the teams on ground, but I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will allow you to decide that, you know, what you want to work with, but we know that we have some information and some some some qualities and skills that can make your work easy for for you in Nigeria, either on renewable echo restoration, we are all there.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some of my contacts.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm actually the senior special advisor for experiential learning in a new go Nigeria so that I'll put some of this and feel free to connect directly.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, no good as the south east and states of Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, we have the Southwest, we have the North, and we have not used region.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if only anyone is enjoying those benefits, please push it to the main reason that I needed to.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would like to use the notary region really need some of this aspect of it.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I believe I've shared some data, so you can go on and look at the information on Google, the notary region of Nigeria is facing.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's also to be an opportunity to be something good that you have enough data for your projects as required.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Love this.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, Joan.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I want to point out that Mara has got a good working relationship with the director of education in Inugu.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Dayo also has some high level government contacts in Taraba, so it really would be an interesting opportunity to compare notes and to see how we can spread the word, so to speak.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Mara, I wonder if you could update us on, I know that you've made great progress in Inugu with the experiential learning.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** To what extent has the eco restoration or ecological theme made it into your program so far?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so if you take a look and I'll try to, I sent a, I shared just a free copy of my book, it's a PDF that's, and it has a chapter on Nigeria, also has a chapter, a case study on Nakavali, which will be of interest, and one on, in Wanza Tanzania as well.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the Nigeria model has sustainable development goals right in it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's something that I did to try to get us some traction.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the whole idea is to have experiential learning, project based learning at all levels and all grades and to focus on local solutions to global problems.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So really positioning the children as problem solvers and innovators and they're doing amazing things around sustainable agriculture around.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** global energy.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Can you give us an example?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the children have, they have a garden and they have been experimenting with hybrid seeds.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're starting in sacks and they have developed their own water filtration system.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have a smart farm.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's, the curriculum itself is very exciting.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The challenges right in Nigeria are such that they have solar but they still use generators sometimes and they're using starlink.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** mean it's tough.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Water, there's no one running water in a new goose.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're really trying to make the challenges an opportunity for innovation.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So each school as it's being built and they're building 260 smart schools across the state, the president came to honor what's going on there.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, there's opportunities for projects, but it's, you know, it's complicated and right now the focus is on scaling 260 new schools.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, the commissioner of education is my colleague at UB and he is back in town.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, so if everyone's interested in hearing more about that, I'm sure he would be honored.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, to tell you about the initiative.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's really hard to partner.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've tried to facilitate partnerships.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, just because the scale of what they're doing is so big.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, and the challenges of getting these schools up.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, we just did the 10 year sector planning and it's very ambitious.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very exciting as a model that can be emulated.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, but it's, it's pretty complicated.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, um, really exciting.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you for letting me mention that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Will he be here 2 weeks from now?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, he will.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think he's, um, got.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some things going on with with family, but if we could plan ahead, he'll be around, I believe for another month or two, he goes back and forth.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, forgiving of forgotten is this a weekly meeting or a bi weekly meeting?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bi weekly.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So by all means, I think it would be great to meet him.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If you both can come two weeks from now, hear about the program.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'll ask him.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And perhaps talking more detail about what could be done, both in terms of restoration, regeneration, agriculture, and perhaps if they can make it parallels with what's going on in Tarawa province.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I will share the white paper that we built the curriculum around.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It is entirely scalable and it can be adapted in different ways, but I think it's interesting to see how you could.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** redo an entire education system around the SDGs and project-based learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's exciting, so I will do that, and then I'm going to jump on my cell phone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you so much, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow, thanks, Mara.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that was really inspiring, because I've been dreaming to do something like this in our schools, because that's really an impactful project.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe I will come and learn more on how I can even start my own project with students through exponential learning.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's really important.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you would permit me, I would just like to share an image with everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Why not?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is a map of all the watersheds in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I find these images very inspiring.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a man whose organization is called Grasshopper Geography.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** When he's mapped every continent on the earth with just the watersheds.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there's no lines around the edges here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The entire continent is defined by the watersheds.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just like if we look at an image of the human body and we saw all the blood vessels, we define the entire body because the body is completely hydrated and every cell in the body was hydrated by blood.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's the same thing with continents and the rivers.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can see that the watershed around Lake Victoria is one of the largest watersheds in Africa and then also this blue one here around the Congo basin.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It looks like the entire Congo drains from this one river here in the West.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like the Amazon River, the similar situation.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It ignores all the highlands because every place where one river system meets another is the highest point, it would be the ridge point where the water sits when it falls.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the water on this side will flow this way and the water on the other side will flow the other way.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very interesting, I just wanted to.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm a day.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm just since.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mara is sharing background on her educational efforts.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm wondering if you have some background to share.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** On your educational activities in.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** To set the stage for next.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For the for the next meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, actually, I think you can also.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's unloaded so I have a documentary where we've been going to schools and, you know.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Educating young people and we first station a first station or so.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mentioned that Rookie C.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And station is cozy and terrible state.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've worked with the commissioner of of education along with commission of environments in putting this in place so that we can find a way for the government to incorporate.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's climate change and green nature to the curriculum, to the student curriculum, and how we can as well educate the teachers, because they are the impactors.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are looking at ways that we can educate the teachers, give them support, and give them the technical know-how on how they can behave, properly educate these students and understand to let them know what their nature is all about, how they can protect their nature, they can love their nature, and what they have to do.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this is about a lot, this is about maybe I will share, Ira, John, you can share the documentary with a link with Mila so that she can see some of the work we're doing.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it is a little bit similar to what they are doing in Namibu State, but how long is the documentary?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** About just 67 minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it was in partnership with Newsroom Africa, International from South Africa, TV, television, so they came that year to Tarabia State for us to make this happen here.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know what you think about.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will share the link with you, John, you can forward it to her so she can see it and ask if she has any question or any other permission she can get across to us.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I would suggest that you share it with this group, but since it's only seven minutes that we plan to play it during the next meeting, which sounds like it would be a very good, concise introduction, then we can hear from the minister from a new state and it'll make a nice little seminar.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye, Mike.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, see I see Dale has given us a link Leonard you'll capture the link you will be our memory.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So you'll remember to have it handy next time and I think we've got a good plan for next week.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Next time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll go with it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I was just going to say I was reminded by that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That map that Amanda showed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** First of all, do you have a connection to Mr.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Grasshopper?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Because he's doing really interesting interesting work.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He might be an interesting person to to recruit.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, I I do have a connection to him.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, well, if you think he'd be a good person to join the era.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It will certainly increase upgrade our visuals.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I was going to say that I know that in many parts of Africa they are dealing with plastic pollution a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And yet I'm reminded that all of the plastic in the oceans, virtually all of it, comes out through a relatively small number of systems.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so it might be worth looking in Africa at what are the major river outflows because there are a number of places now that are beginning to put plastic capture nets or other systems at the estuaries in order to capture that material before it goes into the oceans.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** As most of us know, plastic in the oceans is not just ugly, it floats near the surface.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** collects pesticides.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The pesticides kill the

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** the tiny krill and microorganisms that make the oxygen that we breathe and make the food for all of the food chain in the oceans on which we depend.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it's a big problem, but the watersheds are actually doing a collection process that if we just got on top of, we might be able to address the ocean issue as well as begin working upstream and reduce the amount of  plastic that gets thrown into the land and into the water.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we have 90 minutes now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I wanted us to have a look at what I've been doing with John and Phoebe on the ELA GLSC masterclass.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is very important because we're talking about learning and education and I think this will create a killer in, you know, education and sharing knowledge among the people, especially.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ella members, so I don't know if maybe you are in a position to to share the updates where we are so far.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** On my second class, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think, um, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's developing a little bit slower than we hoped we were a bit over optimistic about the time frame on which we could start, but yes, it is our hope that we can develop and publicize for comment and inputs and volunteers.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh, a schedule for the first say doesn't, uh, potential speakers in our masterclass and, uh, I.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** afraid that I am a little bit of a bottleneck in this process right now because I am still tied up, but I'm hoping to take it forward very much in the next week.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you are interested in volunteering a class and you have not already told me so, even if you haven't told me so, perhaps just send me an email and I will drop my email address in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you say more about what is the format of the master class, where would it be presented?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it something that ERA members will sign up for independent of the schedule?

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that our initial hope was that we could insert into the town hall structure every so often, like every

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Third or fourth meeting would be a masterclass so that we could take advantage of your existing structure and gene pool.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's been part of the real value to the Global Restoration Collaborative of Aligning with eRA.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I still hope that we can do that.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just think that the 19th is proving to be a little bit too short.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And John, I saw something yesterday about an alternative agenda for that date anyway.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in terms of the format, we're seeing it as an option where speakers and or groups of speakers can have a half an hour, mainly for individual speakers max to present the the work that they do, the people involved, its goals,

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's momentum, it's geographies, whatever they wish to teach us and then leave the other time available for engagement and discussion where we might have a group as at the beginning to talk about the high level goals of our global community, how we can use the master classes as one of the mechanisms to accelerate our collective momentum.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then I think that could potentially go on a little bit longer, but I think Leo and I are in agreement with John and the rest of you that having a short focus discussion that opens up into a broader dialogue would be better than long presentations.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So urging people to be succinct and focused in the work that they present between 20 and 30 minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Max.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They're great feature.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you want to add anything to that?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Worst broken.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't have anything to add.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So yeah, it's perfect.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** John, sorry to interrupt you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I was just going to say that another great feature of the anticipated masterclasses that they will be moderated and organized by not me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I appreciate that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think it will add another own to the meetings.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And it's terrific.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That works if it works so far.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** it does.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** by the way, I think we should get clear about how much time you want to reserve for the meeting where it is scheduled.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It could be the full two hours, but it could be a dedicated

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** aided subset and until I know I'm going to continue to be booking people for town hall meetings at a time when they can come on board.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So you can fence off some space or you can declare sovereignty over an entire two hour block.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me ask the room what they would prefer because I think we were considering a ring fenced meeting but there may be value in having it with an ERA typical town hall.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My initial sense was that that might be too limiting and struggling to find an equal balance but I'm in your hands.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think Leo I'm hopefully speaking for you too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well I do think that the master class should

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** have a reserved space of whatever duration you think your event, your agenda requires.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And if we have that during a town hall, I will vow and invite you to make sure that we don't infringe on the space.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I really want you to be able to shape it as you like.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's possible that it will coexist within a two-hour block when you think that's appropriate.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Personally, I'm sorry, Leo, go ahead.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think if I remember, in our initial meetings, we were discussing about having 90 minutes alone.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's hard for most people to have a two-hour meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Skeeter, I see you there.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you may also wish to wait.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in on this directly, I feel it's a challenge for most people to intend a two-hour meeting, especially in the evening.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I would have a preference for having these separate and between an hour and an hour and a half max, I believe.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Obiet.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Skeeter.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so I personally, just as personally, I think trying to do it in a town hall is really awkward because it means that basically there's no time for a town hall or a very abbreviated.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** kind of think it should be a separate thing.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And hours are so short to actually make a presentation and then have a discussion because I'm hoping these master classes are really important and serve a really big role.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think two hours is not on due, but at least

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 90 minutes to really make some headway in a topic.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's really small.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As the idea of doing it every four town halls doing one, that means every two months.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to go for the first 12 would take two years at that time frame of once every two months.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In time of course people want to move and so I'm hoping the master classes are focused on practical techniques like I said before and that maybe once a month or every month and a half.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Something like that but every two months is kind of lengthy because not everybody wants to go to every one.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think there'll be particularly pertinent ones.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But anyway that's just a few much off the top of my opinions off the top of my head.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, Keith.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and I see that Russ has expressed a dissenting opinion.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I want to say that in the spirit of duocracy, those who are organizing it get to pick and choose among and hopefully to reconcile these various positions on this issue.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do think in the long run, Michael may be exactly right that two-hour scheduled dedicated master classes may be just the right thing and would be a really nice relatively high production and relatively well scripted event.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Personally, I think VB's point about taking advantage of our gene pool and our initial audience is a good way to launch the pilot episode, if you will.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, again, Phoebe and Leonard have taken the lead in developing this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** When they decide how they want to do it, they'll tell me which date

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** and time slot they want and we can start that way.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I think it will evolve and I like Michael the vision for what it could become.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, John.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Would it be in everybody's agreement that we hold our initial group discussion within the town hall and then schedule a series of separate master classes?

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that we need to recognize that we need always to be very succinct and strategic in our communications to make best use of people's time and to build momentum and make people feel that their time is well spent and that they've gained a lot of value from it.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Skeeter, as much as I would love to sit through two hours of a master class with you.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am reluctant to have it go on that long generally.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And certainly I would like to leave maximum time for discussion and engagement.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, if I may.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I agree that it should be a short presentation and longer discussion.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I agree with Rush about having it as part of the town hall at least at the beginning, John is saying.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's like, it really probably would improve the attendance.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** bear in mind that you said this will be, there's only, bear in mind that this is in the evening.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would just point out that it isn't, if you're doing it in the evening in Africa, of course it will be at different times in the US or versus Europe, know, other time zones.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, this will be more than in people just in Africa, though hopefully mostly I'm not sure about that, but any rate.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to backpedal a little bit.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** my earlier opinions, I'm easily swayed.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That makes you easy to work with.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** appreciate it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we are over the time, that was really amazing ideas.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think for the time we can try even to shift, like as we used to shift times to see which one is based.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we can conclude on that now because we have another one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And we have a nice plan for next time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I look forward to the focus on experiential educational opportunities in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it'll be great.

**{'display_name': 'Phoebe Barnard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you all.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you capture the

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, heard it's gone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Goodbye.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** LinkedIn page.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know what you just did to Connie but you're...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, there's a buzz on your microphone that comes and goes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I have an issue with my devices.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I can hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I can hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I just also hear the buzz, but it's worth it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you for sharing that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Agra Hope Initiative Foundation in Kakuma, empowering youths, transforming lives, cultivating prosperity.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Those are all the right things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And is that your organization or is that the NGO that you are working with?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Community-based organization.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, welcome.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's great to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mara Huber is here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mara has been...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** doing work in Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But Maura, you missed a really good description of Tokani's work in Kakuma refugee camp in Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's all of the right things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There are lots of young people with secondary education.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very few have got access to higher education.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And the hope is to develop programs that will allow them to improve local conditions through permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All the right things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maura is developing a program that is meant to support that kind of project based in experiential learning all over the world.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So this is our introduction to Tokani.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We have a link to his organization.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He's joining our group.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He was brought to it by Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think everyone knows, Ananda

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Amanda and Leonard and Colombo who are usually regulars at this meeting are all in Uganda right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think as we speak they're traveling back from Nakavali refugee camp back to their Airbnb.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I do think that we're pulling together an interesting network with a shared vision all located in that part of a very big continent.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So we're putting something interesting together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think Mara is beginning to think about a trip in June back to the region to Tanzania.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I will be doing a Fulbright.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will be there from June 1st through.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, John.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in the car.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, excellent.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, June 1st I'll be flying and then staying through the 30th and I will be in Moragoro, which is a couple hours outside of Daras.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** alum, but my hope is that I'll be able to meet with some partners and do some other things.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll be at Sequoian University of Agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the focus is in integrating project-based learning and skill and competency development with sustainable agriculture and with their curriculum.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So hopefully we can build around it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There will be a Pearl Institute and a symposium.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So hopefully lots of opportunities to build on the work that I was doing in Nigeria and continue to do in Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm really excited to make connections, but now we'll be able to go back and keep doing work in East Africa, which is really exciting too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And now it's an international effort.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** International, absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, Takani, can you tell us more about the current status of your project?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you have people working on the ground and how many and what are they working on?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently, we have a, hope you can hear me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, we can.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Currently, we have 15 members for our project.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are working together.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We a small pieces of the land which we are using for our activation on the training.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, since we are still struggling to get a full accommodation where we can accommodate, so because we are still a step up, so we are not much more...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, and to get land, is a critical, now we are still struggling, we have one of our three members who have decided to give us a piece of land where we can be located as our offices, we can settle our offices, and then also we have partnered with one of our, we have partnered with one of our refugees, we have their, we are using their personal land for growing their own crops, we decided to give us for a while, give us for a period of six months that we can use it, so but we have agreed, we have agreed with him because the members and the testimony we have because of the communities, he accept our vision and they say okay so we can continue

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** can use my land, but the day goes, can think about it.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** if you get one, I'm ready, you can purchase it, I can give you, we can use it, then we say that's good, so we will think about that one.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently, that's what I can share about our CST.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's very interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me see if I understand this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You have a refugee who owns land, who is willing to loan it to you for six months and sell it to you if you can raise the funds.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How large is this property?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How big is the land?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the land is not much bigger because the land we are given, so we are not given a bigger

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** land as a host community.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are not a host community of the ear nick.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are giving a piece of land.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it is like this.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe I think I can take the measurement maybe for the next time if you can have another meeting then I can share the distance of the land.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, that would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And a few pictures would be helpful also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But for the moment are we talking about something that is the size of a home or something that's the size of a neighborhood?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, let us know and let us also know more about the land which is potentially for sale.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have to say we don't have money.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But it sounds like you have

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** the ingredients for a good project and we would be interested in helping you to find the money for what you're trying to do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So give us give us more details and we'll see what we can do and maybe we'll get to visit you in June who knows.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So is it okay?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the land the price of the land is not much but it is in Kenya shelling I don't think it can be how much in the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** state but the land the land the price of the land to the 45 45,000 Kenya shelling I don't can be how much I can answer that 45,000 Kenya shelling to dollars and the answer is that's 350 United States dollars

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** and how large is that property so the property the the land itself can be as I said so we don't have actually the measurement of the land already no but just roughly speaking it's it one hectare one hectare 10 hectares no no no no cannot do one hectare so it can be in meters cannot be one okay that gives us an idea yeah um you know that's send us some pictures and some information that's a uh it sounds like it would be a good starting place and it might be something

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that we could help you support.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Leonard, hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** see that someone, Colombo, has just asked for the link to this meeting, so I'm looking for that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, I've given him the, I've given Colombo the link.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, so Leonard, we have met Charles.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're going to meet Josanne, who's here by the phone, but since, and what did I just say?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've met Tokani.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're going to meet Charles.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here comes Eston.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You are coming to us from a hotel not far from Nakavali, correct?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** a visit,

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yesterday?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yesterday and today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Uh huh.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So how's it going?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's going well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** may say it's going well, but before we made some challenges with our permission and whatever, yesterday we had very great visits.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We visited so many places, know, refugees project, Columbus and and Marius and so many other the farmers that they are working with.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was trying to see if I can find some pictures.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** before we go to, I mean, to the refugee, to Nakivari, we had

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We visited the university that teaches courses around about permaculture and beauty and culture.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if I can share the screen, maybe to show you some pictures.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure, please.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, pictures.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, you love pictures.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so this is the institution we visited, the college.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you can see Anna under who is just asking some questions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, actually they have such a great projects either in agriculture and also they do, they keep like ketos, pigs, and so many animals in their paris, so they took us along.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just some learning, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think I took some nice footages because I want to make like a documentary about this genre.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think our last visit will be tomorrow where we will be visiting the last site, but also I want to interview Colombo and Marius mainly to tell us the stories around all the stuffs they do and yeah, and maybe Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Ananda is very busy, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if she will have time to maybe say hi.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would love to say hi to Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** These are great photos.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so she's in the kitchen, busy in the kitchen, maybe she will say hi.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me see if I can find some pictures that we took in Akivari.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But honestly, there is a lot to do there and there is a lot that has been done by people who are there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so the main issue that I may say that farmers are meeting is a learned dry season, which is most of the time proroged, where they have been saying that

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** when the the drought comes it dry out almost all the crops and the other issue is water because they are using only water from the lake in Nakifari which is also all the people I hope that the lake may dry out because you know there is no river which bring water in and they have been telling us you know from the site that the lake has fragmented and so they are trying to see if they can do some initiatives to conserve the lake and the water and you know to put some initiatives around which can help the lakes conservation and to be sure that it have sustainable ways you know

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of getting a water.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me see if I get a picture from McIvarie.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, here they are.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So here is a school that we visited, primary school where they teach a student from primary 1 to primary 6.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They integrated some of our culture and courses.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this is the student in P3, if I remember.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** P2, among them we are having also new learners.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How many of us have been in the program of permaculture?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you put your hand, permaculture program?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are having some new learners.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Alicia, you've been there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, some of them are new, some faces are new.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have not been yet in the program.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in every class we have students who are a part of the program.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's in the camps, the breeding is very hard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, actually we are having amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's an obvious thing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Tree and a lot of landings.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, these are the resources we are trying to use.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have to show them and teach them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so, um, Forbes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, even some students shared what they have been learning to see if I can find one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This was wonderful, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's so helpful to actually see pictures, not just hear your descriptions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And let's interrupt for a second.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Later, let's take a minute while we have Leonce and get an update from Goma.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonce, are you still in Goma?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And how are you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure, yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe if Amanda comes, she will tell you about what she's getting now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's excellent.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonce, so nice to see you alive and I hope well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm fine, John.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm glad to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Eliza.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm now in Mubende.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, isn't that interesting, from Goma where things were very tense, correct?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, for Goma there was...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** there is...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** there is...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** things are very complicated.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I'm in Jinja with Elisa and Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And today we travel with Elisa, we are now in Mubende for the other activities.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, great, oh great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so you and Elisa are in the same place as Ananda and Leonard or no?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are together right now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are together right now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We will join them tomorrow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's very beautiful here where it will hang easily.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** His family is far away, and it's a mahogany farm.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A mahogany farm?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he says he's planting it for his grandchildren.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's just great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's just great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I really feel like we're developing a community.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And there's Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, the tour continues.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's almost like being there, except I don't have to get out of my easy chair.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's been a very instructive.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Being there in person and realizing that...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't have to get out of your comfort zone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A lot of the things that I was teaching them, it's virtually impossible for them to do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's good to be there in person and realize the reality.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** These are the limits of this situation and I won't go into great detail.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will write something up afterwards about that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yeah, it's it's been it's been very instructive.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, just that's a hugely important insight.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll I'll I'll be happy to read about it, but give us a few clues.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some specifics of what you for example, one of the main principles of regenerative agriculture is to keep the soil covered and not turn the soil.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But right in order to keep the soil covered, you have to use something like cover crops or mulch.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there is not enough biomass to do that here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is there is not enough brass.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a lot of.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** there's a lot of really, really bare, compacted soils.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's just, it would be impossible to harvest enough mulch material to keep that volume of fields that are cultivated covered.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, it would take some serious design to figure out how to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, it just, they can't do it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They think they are right now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, that's very good to they crazy?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are there goats?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are goats and there are green But there is not enough, like, large grasses that they could possibly slash them and bring them over.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some people are doing it a little bit with papyrus down by the lake, but if everybody tried to do that,

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They would clean out the papyrus, which wouldn't be a good thing because it filters the water going into the lake and the, the, the deforestation on the hills and the, the amount of bare compacted ground there are.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a serious issue with water carrying, running off the hills, running off bare ground, not percolating in and carrying all this organic matter, which is bringing sedimentation into the lake.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, in order to really do something about that situation, it will require some serious design and also serious education or cultural shift because people have the way that, that they do things and it's not that easy to just tell them to do it a different way.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's really interesting, and yet they have the lake right there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So one imagines that you could pump or carry a little bit of water from the lake up onto some of that exposed ground and begin hydrating the soil, growing the grass, gradually working.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I uses the water from the lake.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, it's pumped up.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we lost her.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe she'll come back midphrase.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ellie, we've been getting pictures from Leonard, reports from Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Moses is doing a really interesting project in

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** uh kikumu i think it's called in kenya another refugee camp and paths are crossing i think we're learning a lot awesome i look forward to the recording for what i missed and i i mean i i just caught what ananda was saying and i have a probably crazy idea but um what comes to mind i mean if we're just looking for a mulch to basically slow the water um and and allow attack and um you know could possibly like refuse clothing be cut up and used to kind of create like a that's a mechanical barrier i haven't heard of that being done but of course uh certainly cotton t-shirts and other fashion off-casts do tend to accumulate in in parts of the world that's very interesting obsolete fascism mulch

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** it's an interesting idea.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know that the west coast of Africa is getting huge amounts of dumped fashion being dumped in the ocean and washing up on shore.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, right.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So potentially there could be a business or sorting and I guess, you know, cutting organic materials and then porting that and maybe that's actually something they could get funded.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It would be getting it to Nakavali.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He really realized the challenge of logistics being here.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That yeah, that seems like a common but one question and then, but is there a port maybe closer.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** know Uganda is unlocked, you know, it's they get paid to take this.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Trash, right?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So if we actually could do something with it, then potentially a port closer to our site Could be a new location for drop-off Yeah, and then from the Indian Ocean Yeah, or from elsewhere unlike Victoria But listen before we invent a whole new system and I will say that is a really interesting system Eliza you've been on the ground and traveling and we've got a good connections.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So why don't you tell us your story?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so I Went from Israel We're always meeting with I met with an interesting Solar company that's actually was the first solar company in Israel Who's interested in getting into more impact and so I have to follow up with that and And the whole Israel experience was very intense being there During the sea

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** fire and there was still protests going on and very different, very different perspective.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** then we went to the room off the Pelico, off the capital city of Kanakri, and I would say that Guinea is Africa on supercharged.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The traffic has absolutely no traffic pattern.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very dirty with regards to trash, very populated, very energetic.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody's selling something.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's just high, high energy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we had to go through the Medina, which is one of the largest markets in West Africa just to get to one side of the town.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody has to go through the Medina and it's like Mad Max.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In terms of energy, but we were able to meet with the women of the island, which has a significant saltwater intrusion problem with their water.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're losing their fresh water because they're pulling it out of salt waters coming in.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We got the water filtration, but it doesn't solve their problem, but it gives them better water.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But they were very happy for that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then we went to Senegal with Dr.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Usman Tom, who had a Sahel Eco Village Festival.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's gotten this area on the Senegal River between Meritonia and Senegal.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they're the same people, the same families divided by a border of an artificial border.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the festival was very, very impressive.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he's really doing remarkable work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's the same problem there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's arid desert.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they really are in the front lines of the desert, the desert location of the Sahara encroaching.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so they've planted trees, they have a tree nursery.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This was about building community support.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we were, we were well treated, did another water filter presentation there again to tremendous response and this very lovely warm people.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The goats are a big problem there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're free ranging as are the cattle.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there's a big difference.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You could see it distinctly between.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One country and the other Senegal allows their goats.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to roam free and they're not protecting the forest and Maritania is trying to protect their forest and this still has green cover so you know they you see it right there it's very distinct so trying to get policy changes and he had a lot of government officials there and we got on news and kareem got a good interview and and got a national news which was awesome so and found some local water champions that are ready to get to work and so that was very positive and then came here to Uganda Edwards Hamlet is magnificent what he's done there is just phenomenal it was a sugarcane field and he's turned it into coffee and coca and bananas and mangoes and avocados and huge vegetable garden

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he gives a lot of credit to Ananda, and the teaching we in Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** now here, we're with Muhengi, and he's got a wonderful community, a buddhu community of young people fired up to regenerate the earth.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's been a very productive trip in terms of making the connections and weaving it together.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there's nothing quite like being on the ground to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can do it on Zoom all we want, but it really is the face-to-face that makes a difference.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No, I know that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Colombo jumping back to Nakavali has got a good connection at the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So Colombo, why don't you say hello and tell us how this trip has been from your point of view?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Joan, and thank you everyone.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That trip has been good, though there are some challenges that Ananda and Leonard faced before with getting the approval to access the settlement.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but good enough we had to find plan B where we had to go and meet the settlement commander directly without like going through the high position of the commissioner and then to the districts level and but good enough now they have everything.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was together with Ananda and the whole team, the whole of yesterday, right away from OPM making sure that the letter of approval is there until later around 6.30 when they left Umbarara they for as we came back to where we stayed.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we visited a lot of places, yeah we visited one of the projects that we're doing with with Diana for lake restoration and I think there are some pictures showing how the lake is drying up where it gets the water from.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We also have to have to visit one of the gardens where we are doing the go forestry and learn how to have some pictures and also where people are doing irrigation.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but we expected today to also visit the trees where ERA has a very big hunt.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not sure whether they risked it because that's not part of the team today.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have some other issues here with the land and there are some couple of meetings that see I personally have to attend.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I have delegate another person to do that on my behalf.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But tomorrow I'm with the team right away from the beginning until when they are going to finish.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll make sure if they have time to take them to the tree lots, which I'm not very sure whether they have time.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** if I do it there, it's a must take them there and also do the interview with Leonardo because we're supposed to do it today.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I couldn't really make it because of other priorities.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'm very happy for Leonardo is doing some amazing work with the photos, videos, interviews, making sure that everything that is.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is captured and recorded and Anna is also very good at the observation and giving his own recommendations on the first site so I'm also hopeful to reading the report that is going to draft and also here the recommendations from her so that we can see how to improve whatever we are doing so we but we miss John and the Ellie it should be more more beautiful if you're also here but nothing nothing nothing has the nothing's wrong and under the represented all of you very well and we hope we hear whatever should come in and what should share about Nakibali thank you that's great and Colombo I think you represent us very well as well it's I'm very proud to be working with you on it it sounds like you're doing a great job of making it happen it's very exciting I don't know if you heard what Eliza

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** was saying what Eliza and Ananda were saying.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ananda was saying there is a lot of bare ground and it's a challenge.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Eliza said, what about goats?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And she reported that the ground looks very different in Senegal depending on whether they control the goats or not.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What is the goat management like in Nakavali?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In Nakavali, Ananda said there's a lot of bare ground and it's because they don't have enough mulch and enough water to really grow grasses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But Eliza has been in Senegal and in Senegal, in Nigeria, if I remember correctly, she said they do not allow the goats to roam free and there's much

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** much more vegetation on the ground.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But on the other side of the river in Eliza, what's the right country to name?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maritania, can never say it right.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maritania, it's Maritania, Maritania, Maritania.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In Maritania, the goats roam free, and they nibble the vegetation down to bare ground.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I'm just curious, what's the goat management like in Nakavali?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do the goats roam free?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yes.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's the only activity.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's the system they use.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a free range system.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And here we have one of the tribe, which is one of the most powerful tribe in the country, called Bahima.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the rare, I think another took some pictures.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** find the family is having like a thousand or two thousand, I mean, or two thousand, even five thousand cattle, or goats, and then they just keep like walking around.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a lot of conflict between cattle keepers and the crop growers because of that.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** People go, sometimes the cows, they come and enter and the government has total failed to have to control that because this tribe of cattle keepers is so powerful because even the president, that's where it comes from.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All these top officials, that's where they come from.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's why in most cases, they're not vegetable because that's the system that is there, the place is hot, and again, there's no control of animals from one place to another, and I think that's the challenge that Nakiva is facing up to now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that sounds like an interesting opportunity, actually.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, managing cattle is one of the best managing them, not as free-ranging cattle, moving them systematically through the landscape in such a way that it gives them

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** the landscape fertilizer but also then gives the plants a chance to grow back is a very powerful technique which improves the cattle quality but also restores the land and makes it useful for agriculture as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I doubt that you're going to be able to persuade this other tribe but it interesting to create a pilot project that demonstrates the what's called managed grazing perhaps managed grazing combined with fertilizer in order to show that cattle can be used much more efficiently and much more effectively to restore environments as well as increase the yields.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not easy to persuade them but maybe

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** having a pilot's project to showcase that it is possible, that would be the best way to do, but these people they are really big-headed and here we have a perception that all cattle keepers they also think like cattle because like all their brains are just thinking about milking, about grazing, so it's not as easy as that to persuade them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I understand it's true all over the world and yet eventually if people see that their neighbors are doing better, maybe over time it will spread.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's our challenge.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so Mohege's father Humphrey is doing a cattle project.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it be interesting to get on a call with him and he's been doing it for a number of years and they have a cooperative and they're they're getting much more milk than the free range

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's a great story.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, I would love to know more about that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I would love to have Colombo get to learn more about that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And my sense of geography and the itinerary is not great, but it might be nice if Leonard could actually capture some of that story.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think this is the way it happens, right, is from spreading examples.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Leonard will be coming with Ananda to move in.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we'll make sure that he gets to interview Humphrey.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've been joined by Joshua Laser, who I don't think I have met before.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Forgive me if I have.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Joshua.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we did image

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, maybe last month I think.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello guys, this is Joshua Liza from Tanzania.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to meet you Joshua.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you John.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was really glad to be joining you as you remember, to be joining you in Uganda, but happened that after my visit in Kenya, went back to, we had some family issues though I did communicate with Delena, he kind of told me that you guys will be visiting Kenya, probably.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think that's right.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we, I was waiting to know the, I think it's shadow dates and I wanted just to know if there is, for us to know the location of the city that you guys will be visiting so that we can arrange ourselves in Tanzania even for one day to

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** across the border and meet you guys in Kenya and officially physically meet you and know each other before before you go back.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well that's great Joshua why don't you put your email into the chat they've had a power outage at the we're Leonard and Ananda are right now but we can send them a message and are you located Joshua well today I'm located northern part of Tanzania in Arusha though I'm not in the city today I went back for we had some family images but I'm based in Arusha Tanzania okay so from March 2nd to March 9th we will be uh I will be in ginger

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then Ananda will be in Kenya for with Moses So And then Ananda is going to Kenya So the answer is Ananda and Leonard will be in Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No Elanda and Moses will be in Kenya March 3rd yes No, probably the fourth or the fifth Okay, our event is on the third in ginger, so she'll be there for that Okay Well, you're welcome to come to that if you wish Kelly did you get that accurately enough you can put it into the what's up, but I think You

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I did not, I did not, but I can get it from the recording.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And the.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Joshua's email and WhatsApp number.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are also in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So if you're free to do the follow up that would.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And connect them so they can actually arrange a meeting that would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think them they are connected already through Leonard, but.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm sure.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We haven't heard from you yet today, but you tell me that you can talk.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Remind us where you are and what you're doing.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, team.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you?

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, how are you?

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** around JaZan, we're getting sound effects, but not words.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Your connection is weak.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, now we can hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm telling you guys that I work with Yes Global Initiative and we deal with the youths and schools and we deal with environmental issues.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We work with a lot of schools so that we make sure there is proper waste management.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** we try to address issues of climate and a lot more than that.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're we're expecting you guys to come in Uganda but unfortunately we couldn't see you because they told us maybe you guys are to the outbreak you won't be able to come to Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've really missed you so so much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We are learning a lot just by these conversations and by these pictures but I know it's it's no substitute for being in there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I saw the lovely posters you made for Ananda and Eliza's visit so between Ananda and Eliza and Leonard I'm looking forward to hearing about your event.

**{'display_name': 'Josean’s iPhone', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, let's see Russ nice to see you here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've gotten all sorts of updates.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you have anything to share with this group on this occasion?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You're on mute You're on mute I think you can also unmute him John.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I got it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I got it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry Anyway, Nakavali Lake it's very important to to really coordinate and start a massive planting there around the lake.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are about 200,000 people plus It's not just Nakavali Red Sheet settlement, but it's also surrounding communities that depend on that lake.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As they said, there's no rivers coming in So it's pretty much rainfall and Uh Some people here might be familiar with the water forest around Mexico's

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** city which of course the bureaucrats are destroying by letting them tear down the trees and and you know do different kinds of development but it it's in the past it's been responsible for the forest itself harvesting the rainwater been responsible for eating enough water to take care of 15 million people that's really what needs to happen in Akavali ASAP because the number people keep coming the the amount of water needed by the the people and other activities is just increasing and if they don't get the vegetation there to harvest the rainwater and control the sanitation and provide the food etc etc that's 200 000 plus people that are have a dwindling resource it's source that could be brought back hopefully by enough

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** vegetation but it's a real challenge I mean just the water to take care of the vegetation so so I need the a lot of rainwater retention measures bioswales you know half moons different things to capture every drop of that rainwater when it does come sink it down so it can go into the like slowly and anyway it's it's a it's a scary situation you got to do something I'm talking with warm brush there's a kijanji forestry some friends mine in Uganda who planted 17 20 million trees something like that get them some funding get them involved bamboo is great betavir's great but it's it's a scary scary situation that that the only way to do it is is

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the right kind of vegetation.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll be quiet, but just that's a huge project that needs some doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, it's a good review of the challenge and the opportunity.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do feel that we're building a network that may be able to produce a coherent plan and perhaps try to advance this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Colombo has already demonstrated that small contributions can really strengthen the community and the effort.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I have two questions.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do you think a cost estimate for that kind of project might be just about part of the envelope and also Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So is this the kind of thing that the commissioner comment on the folks that you're talking

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** about as sort of the representatives of Nakavali, are they thinking about these things?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Would they be interested to have a conversation about these things if it's attractive in any way for them?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, maybe if I could go first.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently they are trying to revise the policy regarding the conservation of lake Nakavali.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because before there was a government power state called National Environment Management Authority, it's the one that was managing the lake and it and they would live a hundred meters as a buffer zone.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** After a hundred meters that's where people would start doing other activities.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But unfortunately people have not been respecting this and all the cattle keepers that the area they produce.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So when you look at the reality, all these activities we are affecting the lake a lot.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So now they have

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** revised that policy and now they're allowing any activity that is that can restore the lake to take place within that buffer zone so because like we look at the whole Lake Nakevali they could leave 100 meters from the lake up to where people have to cultivate so and now they're encouraging any person with any initiative like bamboo planting with vetiver with what to use that area the whole surrounding the whole Lake Nakevali and the that's a connoisseurs part of these parts we have been given 15 acres of land to do the restoration we are going to plant bamboo and they are willing any other person or any other partner that has maybe resources to be as part of the initiative to do the lake restoration so this is the current policy that they have revised no construction know what but something that is there to do the conservation of Lake Nakevali so the just policy that they've just introduced this

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This year, and today, why I didn't join the rest, I was part of that meeting with the delegation from the Ministry of Environment, so to make sure that that land is supposed to be used for that, because really the water levels are going down and the people are not using what's coming up with effective solutions to make sure that this solution is implemented.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a great report, Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** are aware that Russ and other members of the ERA are world experts in the processes by which you can capture more rainwater, restore lakes, and do exactly this kind of thing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I hope you will offer our assistance as they develop their new policies.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John, Colombo and I have been working together for a couple of years, but just

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just so you know, I mentioned Warren Brush.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Warren is a resilience design expert.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's done amazing things around Africa and also around Ventura, California, but that's where he started.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's in Uganda, Palabek.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A refugee settlement has about 80,000 people, and that's where he has a design, well, a center.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he has incredible people that come twice a year.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I got scholarships for Colombo and Anzema and Samuel to go to his next one.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the thing is that he also works very, again, these amazing institutions from around the world come to this training center twice a year for a two-week course.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have no working groups.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're all hardworking groups.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They got to bring their boots.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They put it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** give them shovels.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they're out in the field.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A lot and then they they sets work shoulder shoulder sets shoulder to shoulder with people from smaller NGOs and larger NGOs And and the larger NGOs really know that the smaller NGOs get a lot more bang for the buck so they actually tend to Set up some collaborations between the larger and smaller ones, but very very importantly one of the the guys is very involved there is also very He's connected.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's he's part of basically the crown family foundation So that's a lot of money and the other person and this this guy from the crown Family we're having we already had a preliminary meeting Including Mary Carbohawk, but we had a meeting about two weeks ago We're setting up another one.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This one's going to have the guy from crown foundation, but also Excuse me the minister in Uganda whose

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the minister in charge of the all the refugee camps and he's a he's a really good guy he's a very very close friends with both Warren and this other guy so we're to make some proposals and certainly point out what needs to be done to save Nakavali and the water resources for a quarter million people million plus which would be a big mess for Uganda if they don't right if they don't jump on that and and do whatever they can so but as far as Ellie you said how much would cost quite a bit but they get the Crown Foundation some other people involved it's a pittance to them and it's it's the kind of thing they want to do if they identify a

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very important project, hopefully, it will be discussed.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, is there anything that sorry to interrupt, but is there any resource that we can help to prepare for you in that pitch?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nope.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, it's, it's, it's all, it's all there.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good luck.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Keep us posted, Russ, and thank you for your work over the years and behind the scenes.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Colombo, your hand is up.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I just wanted to supplement a bit from what Russ has been saying about Warren Brush.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, Russ connected, Russ is a very good connector.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He connected me to Warren Brush, and we have met a couple of times.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're supposed to, this time we're supposed to be with Warren Brush.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because that was even the intention why I was not supposed to be here.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was supposed to be in Northern Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because the idea was,

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** because Warren has been working in Palembeke District in northern Uganda for some good time and he has very many connections.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the idea was we go after finishing the course of two weeks then meet some high-level personas in the Kampala including the minister for refugees and other big donors and maybe the country directors of these big organizations so that you can also have another branch in Naki Valley so that he does his own concentrates in northern Uganda but also in Naki Valley then you can also go to other parts of the country but unfortunately the funds for the seminar that's for two weeks was supposed to come from the USA and because of all this so that's why this one didn't happen but we are we are planned to meet in June yeah maybe this one is going to happen but it will happen now but unfortunately now it's impossible and Russ is that the scholarship you were talking

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Talking about that, you'd help them obtain?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unfortunately, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we'll have to see it's probably, how much is it?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's probably under $1,000 per person to get there, right?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To transportation.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** they stay right at Palobec.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have a beautiful training center with dorms and kitchens and such.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo, so is that, unless that money comes up, you won't be able to go?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that correct?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You and Samuel and Anzima?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, because on the point of worrying was like, I was supposed to go at first.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then because like the slots for scholarship were very few, like this.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then he was proposing then the three of us could maybe go in October, if not, if not November, but because he told us everything is provided, meals, accommodation, everything they have, everything at the facility.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the transport for two and four then everything is provided at the site.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But they do need some money, some funds earmarked for you and then you come up with the transportation money from Nakavali to Palovedo.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, they would meet any other cost, the registration fee, everything that so far as could just meet the transportation.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any other things they could meet?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So to attend all you need is a transportation which is probably only a hundred dollars or so?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I've never been to Palovedo, that's why I didn't make sure that I know how much it takes because I've never been there.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I can't tell you it is a hundred or it is 50 because it's really far but I can't tell.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So Colombo, when is this event for which you just need transportation?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm hopeful it will be needed.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** June, if at all they get the money for the workshop that was supposed to happen now, but I think the organizers that we are affected by the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** age, I think they're still also looking for maybe other partners or maybe the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** age comes back, but up to now I'm not very sure.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, they have so many partners, John, that I strongly suspect that Warren will come up with the money for the workshop.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** there's a good chance that to get Colombo, Samuel, and Anzema there, we just need the transportation money.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** When the opportunity is well-defined, we will be interested in supporting that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think Colombo is a good investment.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you, Go ahead, Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'll be letting you know that I currently can't specify the month or the date because until I hear from Warren.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'll just say, know, Warren, I invited him to ERA Africa, I gave him a day's notice two weeks ago, actually four weeks ago, and he really wanted to come.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I asked that he be put on the mailing list, but it didn't happen for some reason.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But once he can get this on a schedule, I communicated with him again today to see if he could come at the last minute.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But he wants to be here to talk to this group, to participate with this group.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he'll, of course, be able to give a wonderful presentation about what they do on at Palobec.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In fact, there's a podcast he did about three months ago.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll send it to you, John.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe it can distribute to the rest of the group if you want to.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And if you give Ellie or me or Leonard Warren's email, we will put him on the calendar.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I also just want to point out there are two invitations on the calendar right now.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is held by John and one is held by Russ for the same time slot.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we should also make sure we clarify which the correct one is before we invite it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would write this minute.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I was trying to forward it to some people.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's something happened where I became an organizer, which was not my intent.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** OK.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think it's possible to.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's actually quite hard to share an event.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have to make it public to a calendar, and then you can get a link.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in general, though, we can add more folks to the invite list.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I sent the email, excuse me, the email addresses for some people to Leonard, so it will eventually get added, Warren and some other people.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe you can even have a person from the Crown Foundation with them.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're very, very good friends.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That would be great, Ron.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so let's see if Aston has been waiting to contribute anything.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see that Onseema has joined us also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're coming to the end of the hour, but it's great to have everybody here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Aston or Onseema, do you have any news or updates for us?

**{'display_name': 'Eston mgala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I think I've been throwing the meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Eston mgala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** has been amazing hearing about.

**{'display_name': 'Eston mgala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** they make culture programs and what's happening in Naga Valley and some challenges they are facing.

**{'display_name': 'Eston mgala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think together we can do something.

**{'display_name': 'Eston mgala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's keep up with what we are discussing and sharing.

**{'display_name': 'Eston mgala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are like a global village where they diverse, yeah, there's diversity of knowledge and I think we are sharing a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Eston mgala', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So thank you for that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, thank you for that, Estyn, but I agree.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do think that we are stitching together a really interesting network and we're making progress, but we haven't quite figured out what the package is yet, so your thinking on this will be much appreciated.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I think we're making great progress and this trip I think is making important connections along those lines also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** On Seema Roland, any notes for us?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ah, you got to meet with Ananda and M.P.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I got to meet them and yeah, we did a short visit around, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Terrific.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Can you tell us anything about it?

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, it was an opportunity to speak French, actually.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's been so long that we didn't speak French.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** mean, we learned French in Congo and reaching here would have to adapt to English and it's not always that you meet someone you're going to speak French with.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** it was fun and I realized we are forgetting French more.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As we dive into English more and yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we did a visit and yeah, it was nice.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope they'll be sharing it.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** more with you all and when they have the time to yeah and was that at not the valley where did you what did you do in the visit what did you see i mean i mean akibali and yeah um i i brought them to a school where we we did the women empowerment project and part donations and yeah we talked with the director of the school who explains to them um the challenge they have been facing and how um they they part products uh brought a change into the students who used to like miss over the periods but they're having um the product we use in it and also um reducing the that feel of reusable parts which always get thrown out so these are usable parts and i've been using them for a year now and it's still used the same way yeah

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That same one, so it's helping that way.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also we visited, we talked about three planting sessions because we also had a session at the same school.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was a session between parents, students, and we had a few teachers also in there, and the students taught the parent what they learned.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's full about the trees and parents also explained to the students how it's planted, how it's taken care of that kind of stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so the student was speaking more of the science and the importance of the trees and the parents also shared.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it was like a connection session for the parents and students and the school to connect and have something that they can all share about.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, and also we went out and saw a few trees, they gave us feedback on.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** um um the calypter is not planting and we are not going to plant more of those anymore yeah yeah and yeah basically that's it and yeah so we left them to go on with the trip terrific John John can I can I say something real quick of course okay so I want to tell a story about Anzema she uh she's very impressive very persistent very smart kind of taught herself English in a way when she's eight years old she decided to do that but uh she's noticed by a group and she's invited to a permaculture conference in Taiwan and and they they put together a GoFundMe page they raised six thousand dollars so she could go she got on the plane she got to Abu Dhabi I think it is and

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the people of the airport got confused and they said, well, your papers really aren't complete.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They were wrong.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everything was complete.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But she had to go back from Abu Dhabi back to Nakavali, raise some more money so she'd go back to Abu Dhabi, straighten them out, and then continue on to Taiwan.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So talk about persistence.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's 22 years old.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so she's going to be a big help to Nakavali in the world.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's fantastic.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, that was one hell of a journey.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's the kind of grid that we need to get projects done.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So well done.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I was just so very persistent.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, I didn't go back all the way home to Nicaragua.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I stayed like close to the airport because I was like, I really believed I was going to make this because all my documents were in order, I think they just got confused with me having the Congolese nationality and the passport from Uganda all on the same document.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I tried to talk with a few people at the airport and I think maybe I was talking to the wrong ones, but yeah, I came back and together with some people who helped me, we sent emails around to embassies and to airports and stuff, and we bought a new ticket and yeah, I went and I reached at the event actually.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was one challenge, big fun actually, yeah, but I made it, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Have you and...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are you in Colombo in the same area?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you, I've forgotten.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you two know each other personally?

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, we do.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are in same camp and we are in the same area.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, two years, two years ago, I used to, my CBO used to buy trees from there.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They had the nursery bed and we didn't have one yet.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we used to buy from them and we had that kind of collaboration.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we know each other.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, we collaborate, we share and we talk.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it's very good to know Samuel also.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's very good friends with Samuel also.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very, very good friend.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's great to know that we have energetic young leaders there who know what needs to be done and are taking steps to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would urge you to help us figure out how to support and amplify what you're trying to do.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, here we are trying to figure it out, but we need, we need you to give us some concrete opportunities.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** am actually, there is a project that we are working on and it's, it's, it's like a TOT project, Training of Trainers.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, we are willing to train more youth who are interested and have them go back to their community, like a community of 100 or 200 people, 200 families, 300 like that and implement the project there and well, 200, 300 people.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It sounds little, but it's very many people to bring together and and train and make a change.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** so with my team, are planning this program and it will be a year long.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** training, it's like it's a TOT where they learn by doing.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it won't be a theoretical training.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They will be actually practicing everything.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We shall have a mushroom business and I will not do anything in that.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They will start it from scratch and grow it while running from that and we shall invite trainers to come and like the trainers work will be like giving them feedback while they do the actual work and also they will go through a PDC and they will be training under our supervision.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we assure that when this year ends they are really equipped with the knowledge and the practical work on implementing the project in their villages and we sent out an application for volunteers those who will be going through this and actually somewhere he applied.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I hope he will be there.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm just thinking we have so many people and he's already in the movement.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I haven't told him this, but if there is more youth who need this more than him, then he won't be.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But yeah, he's there, applied.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I really hope we can work together on this.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yeah, we haven't got the funds yet for this, but I've shared it with Morag and she got interested in it.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, hoping to start.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** am not expecting for everything to just fall on.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I want to start small because it's a yellow project.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we start with the beginning.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They go through one training and start training others.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** we will start with the business, actually, because the income from that business is going to be stipulated for them.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's like a motivation for them to do.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** recent to stay in the project.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's one big project I'm really rooting for nowadays and yeah, I'd really appreciate much if there was possibility to find it and so we can have many more trainers around the human in the outside.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, please send me your proposal.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right, we'll see what we can do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It sounds great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It sounds like a really perfect kind of a program and it's in good hands.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So send us the information.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will do that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I will do so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Cool.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, I think we have done a lot today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I really like what's happening and it's a pleasure to be able to get a window into it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Did you say just now that you have already shared this program with my

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mara Huber, who was here before you today?

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, no.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I said, I shared it with Morag.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's my, she's my mentor.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** did my PDC with her and so she still supports me with feedbacks and I always share with her.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, she's my mentor.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I share with her.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So in addition to Morag, who I don't know if I've met, I'm frankly not going to keeping track with all these meetings.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mara Huber is developing hands on learning projects in Tanzania and in Nigeria and she will be very interested in the story you just told.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will send her this recording.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll send everyone this recording, but I'll suggest that you listen to the part that you just told us because it's a great program.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ansiima Casinga Rolande', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** weather is cool.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's learning a bit.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not hot, it's not cold, which is good.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We hear, we know what cold weather really is.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I can imagine.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You folks, it's 20 degrees and you call it cold.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I may say like the coldest here is like 12.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 12.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 12 is rather cold.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that cold right now is it?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean for us we can say oh we are freezing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You still in Uganda?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I have to know history.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in New England in the state of Maine.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah we're actually going to have a snowstorm tomorrow.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah I think maybe we can do the checking because I see people are still draining.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe we can do checking other people will be draining and then we we talk about our agenda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I do have a checking question maybe you can use in today's meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Question, just a question.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What is your last book that you read and maybe a book or article that impressed you?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in one minute and how was it?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like my last book, if I remember, it's another book.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's another book.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They listened to one about restoring the philosophy of life.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's amazing book.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm still learning from all the aspects that she mentioned.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a cool and trusting book.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will pass to another and then she will pass to another one.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I'm reading a book that I think it was Russ that actually suggested.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm reading Cobalt Red about the incredible exploitation of people in

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** DRC over centuries, but most recently over the minerals to make rechargeable batteries for iPhones and rechargeable cards.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yeah, it's a very sobering book.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm glad to know that this is going on.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will pass it to Russ, who's...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, I'm reading East of Eden by John Steinbeck for about the third time.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Really amazing book.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've read most of his books at least three times, but I hadn't read this one for a few years and unbelievable.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the writing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You've seen the movie, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You've seen the movie, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, with James Dean.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** all right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** East of Eden, course, is a favorite.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can't really see this one, but this is The Wolves of Kay Street, which is how the, let's see, I can read this, read the cover over there.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The secret history of how big money took over big government, which is exactly why we're having so much trouble or, you know, part of it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** kind of the way of the world for 10,000 years or so, I guess.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** it is very disgusting.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** insightful.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A couple of brothers wrote it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was actually bought for me by Jake Kelly.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He said, if I'll read it, he'll buy it for me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, John, what are you reading?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm reading.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm reading two books right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm reading The Light Eaters, which is quite good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The Light Eaters, which is all about plant intelligence.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm trying to, I'm also, both these books are open a third of the way in.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm also reading Sleigh Ground by the guy who wrote The Overstory.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** His name I'm forgetting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's my reading.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or lack thereof.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pick someone else.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Pick someone else.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I'm late, so I don't know if they have to pick for me.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can choose Eliza, Diana, or Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll choose Diana.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I chose Diana, but now I'm going to choose Eliza.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I'll jump in.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm reading an interesting book that I would actually love for us all to kind of study, which is called Grassroot Economics by Will Redick.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's about adapting traditional Africans, specifically Kenyan models of economics to the modern world.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he says they're working.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just picked it up and just started it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's just out recently.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I have a couple of friends that met with Will in Denver at an event.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I think I could get to him pretty easily and really kind of create the community of practice to really take on the economic aspect that we're all challenged by.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Cool.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will, I will keep us all up to date as I get further into it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great book.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think just we had, we had a working group within GLSE called a grassroots economies.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think that book is, it's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe you will, maybe in the future, talking about the grassroots economies, especially Africa, maybe you can give us a class in the future.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you familiar with that?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** particular book Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, not really.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I've been reading about the concept of the grass-roots economy in Chile.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so picking, picking Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi Moses.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we are doing check-in.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you've been following.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the question is, is your last, the last book that you read or the book you are reading and how about it?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently I'm reading The Talking Pillars of Life by Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So since Ananda came here, been on this book for quite

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** some time.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One, because it's more relevant to what I'm doing, regenerative agriculture with small older farmers.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It has a few concepts that we are training on composting.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I love this book and I've been reading it quite a lot in the past few weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right, see the last person is Erie.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi Erie, long time.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Diana speak?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She didn't open her mic fast enough.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe she can speak fast and then Erie.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sorry, I missed that cue, John.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was coming back.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm actually reading two books right now.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is the Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins and

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a good book for those of us who are working outside conventional thoughts and processes to not to be discouraged by various forces.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this woman is very dynamic and she has a podcast.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's an interesting read.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then the other one is by Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Vision of Climate Futures is called What If We Get It Right.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And she's a really great writer.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I highly recommend that as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** She's been on my list.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, read the book and then invite her to give her presentation at one of our town hall meetings or master classes.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a great idea.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually this right now, Leonard, you've given me an idea and others can chime in on their thoughts.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Should we

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** perhaps have a short list of recommended reading in our newsletter.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Add it to the bottom sections there.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So every month if we can, you know, give it three or four different books to read that others would recommend.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that might be nice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's a great idea.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm reading a book called The Intellectual Foundations of Information Organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A lot of syllables.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's a funny way to say all of the sort of insights from library science put into one very succinct book.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's pretty nerdy, but it's helping me think about how to design my eternal platform.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you so much for sharing it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was nice.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh my yes, bonsai.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you're doing chicken.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you read any books or if you're reading any books, just you can tell us how you feel and which book are you reading or have you read?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, is either not reading or not speaking or both?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you got the internet issue.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think, I think if he's not speaking, maybe we can have some updates like personal

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what I'm doing after Uganda trip I'm trying to to work on the film like I came up with so many footages I think I will coordinate with Elizabeth and see how we can do this because also she has a lot of resources so I've been talking with John about how we can do it but it's big work and yeah hectic so we decided to do like a very short short it is a short video that we can use for our work but also we keep working on a documentary which is a big work and interesting one so I don't know if john has anything to update about maybe how the mass class went and I'm quite sure that uh Ananda has something about the plans the thing we want to do for Africa and

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Just to pursue the video notion, thanks to Leonard, I had a conversation with Eliza and also with one of his mentors, David, what's his last name?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're David Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** McGowan.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm David McGowan, who is a professional filmmaker.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Eliza, we talked about creating a shared video pool, as you had suggested.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I sent you an email saying, I do have 100 terabytes in the Google Workspace account, but you may have something you prefer.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But let's, is it possible we can just agree on the place and then begin pouring our content into it?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think so.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 100 terabytes is lovely.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Then I will share a hard drive with you and Leonard and with McGowan and they first step will be to just put it all there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Then we'll know that if Leonard's hard word dies or gets stolen, we're still covered and that'll be a next step.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My suggestion, John, with that is for each of us to put it in our own folder so the footage doesn't get all mixed up.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So have one folder that's for the documentary, we each put our footage into one folder and then we can organize it by day or by location, whatever, within our own folders.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So actually for me, did organization, I have both footages organized, so it will be within the Leonard folder, you can control all of your subfolders.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Anandas?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you have some material you want to contribute, or should we leave it to the so-called professionals?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I think we should leave it to the so-called professionals.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not a great photographer, and I don't have video footage.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we did have a masterclass.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It was terrific.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard and Phoebe moderated.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it was quite good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We distributed it on LinkedIn, Phoebe also distributed it to her network.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We saw a burst of our LinkedIn activity.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard is working on that, but there's also a discussion going on about maybe an ERA Africa social media something.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it's a great idea.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm not suggesting that it'd be a funded position from the ERA budget at the moment, but I suspect that we've got

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** the talent, and that if we develop a plan for our group, we'll be in a good position to seek funding for that and other activities, which set stage for Ananda talking about our plans of how to follow through on this trip that some of us went on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I pass it to Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I spent a number of days when I got back downloading everything that happened and my impressions into a report, which I have shared with all of you in the general eRA membership.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And since then, there's various bits and pieces moving in different directions, hoping that it will all kind of come together in some kind of coherent whole,

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the various bits and pieces.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've gone ahead with Moses and his organization to make plans for pillars of life to be printed in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're hoping to start working on that soon.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've made an agreement with the publisher and identified a printer.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is moving along and I'm hoping that that will be part of some kind of an initiative to develop an education curriculum strategy so it could have other aspects besides merely disseminating a book.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I did have conversations with the flip town folks about social media content and African content.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that there is potential to create more

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of a kind of case studies, stories, like African examples of how to put those principles into practice and African case studies.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm not sure how all this would become together or be coordinated, but it's one of the ideas that's kind of floating in space and subject to more conversations with different people.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've also been working on, I put Marius in touch with Jackson Canuno, who is one of the people that has a teaching center.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not so far from Naka Valley, so we're looking at the potential to have some exchanges there.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we're also trying to come up with some kind of

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** plan as to how we made through ERA, and we're going to be having a further discussion about this after this meeting, how we might be able to channel some funding for larger projects through ERA to smallholder, because two of the things that I observed is that almost everybody that I met on the trip is, has some kind of small network working with smallholder farmers to implement regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And through those different small organizations and all those different networks that include many kind of local networks of smallholder farmers, there may be some way to organize that into a bigger project that could channel funding.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** funds into those different organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we don't know what funding agency, we don't know how to structure the project, but we're talking about that.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that there is a lot of potential because, I mean, we've just got so many members that are doing that and it is so needed.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it was really the way to work.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like for any of you who've read my book and read the part about Vijay Kumar in India that you'll know is exactly what he did do.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** funneled into a network of women's groups in his case, but women's groups all over the place.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there was already a social web of connection that was in place.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think that we have the beginnings of that actually in ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there has to be some way that we can put some type of organizational and financial.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** structure together to coordinate the efforts of that to have a bigger impact.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so more more discussions to be had.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy to hear that and volunteer to design at first the infrastructure that we can maybe bring in.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think at this stage it could probably just be the sort of manual efforts, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like if we had a little bit more coordination from ERA, know, connecting with leaders like Leonard and Moses and so on to support sort of outreach.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But that's the broad picture of what we'd like to support with the app is actually activating that social web as you describe it and bringing resources to it as well.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think John has, John and I have had some conversations about that and sort of ERA is the facilitator of financial investments that can

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** support moving forward with certain kinds of projects.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, maybe we can take as an action item to really get that on paper.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's a pretty compelling vision for someone to fund at some point if we can kind of pin it down.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm happy to volunteer to do that too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right then.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, with all of that volunteering from the ever-component and organizational ELI, what kind of timeline and time commitments do you think we should, how should we set our expectations for how this will unroll?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think we have a lot of the information that we need to assemble, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been kind of

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** capturing notes for the last few months on calls.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** really, I need to just find some time to write this up and then share, I think, with Ananda, with John, with others who are interested.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And once that happens, there should be, you know, maybe a little bit of more structure on calls like this, where there may be pointed towards, you know, a goal or certain people are trying to identify what the goal should be.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, you know, certainly within the month of April, we should be able to define all that.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'd like to jump in and say that we're sort of edging close to sort of what the Water Unity Network is already about and is already working on.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's certainly not a custom-made platform or app.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that two could definitely complement each other, already

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of sort of spaces within the water community where action groups have been forming for a year and would also offer to eRA if the eRA wants a presence there.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At least, you know, until something, you know, until Ellie gets her hers designed or whatever it is, it's not set in stone in any way.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very fluid.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's a place better than what's out in terms of organizationally and it's a pretty well functioning community platform.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I put that message in the group of the, so whoever wants to join, we already have a space there for you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** East Africa and for the Nile watershed as well so I'll just kind of leave it at that and it's really whoever shows up and wants to start working there has got a place and if it's not there we can make one and I'm glad to be the guide in terms of how to get into it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, Eliza I spent over an hour today looking at WhatsApp and have and discovered that with WhatsApp communities you can set up communities and sub communities and sub communities etc.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think you're an intrinsic organization so that if you post into the mother of all communities the message goes out to all of the sub communities or at any rate all the people in those communities but that doesn't seem to be the way these are all set up and I find it quite bewildering.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** to keep on shifting around and tracking all of these conversations?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I agree.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One thing about WhatsApp is that it's not as secure as it could be, and so, and it's hard to, you know, for example, there's the bulk grassroots economics.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is a specific small topic about wanting to study something around the economics.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody could be posting all sorts of documents related to this, but it gets lost in the string.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So even though the communities work, I find WhatsApp works quite well for casual chatting, for introductions, but it's hard to keep the cohesion.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then the other thing with WhatsApp is whoever comes into WhatsApp only gets what they information that from the point they came in.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I can post something and it's lost to the new people coming in, and I have to post

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, you can pin things at the top, it only lasts for 30 days, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this is a problem, so, you know, just in terms of coherency.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So what's the solution?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, for me, I feel something like a designed platform for this that is safe and is, you know, this, I like the World Water Community because this is a larger community that Water Unity Network is nested inside.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there's all sorts of really interesting people working on watershed restoration, working on, um, hang on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, so I think this is, I think we lost a lot, so there.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I'm here, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, um, this is a, I, I, we're not going to solve this one today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Um, but it's a continuing challenge.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ellie wants to create a platform.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you want to move people onto the platform.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Meanwhile, we have a constant proliferation of these groups.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, on the one hand, I think our network is thriving, but I do think that the burden of tracking all of these conversations is something we're going to want to address.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I don't know how.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** managing the complexity of the task at hand, you know, we're talking about essentially turning the tipping point of the planet, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not an easy task.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I mean, so we're also talking about starting a new infrastructure platform because what's that?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Obviously, I mean, it's not many people have these problems, but it's still the de facto used, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, maybe what we could and I am making progress on the design.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, you know, funding it is another question entirely, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think, you know, it's feasible that we as CA could

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** offer a platform for the basics, maybe not so much conversation that sprawls out and how to navigate and map all of that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's the complexity that we wanted to NASA to fund, but who knows right now.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we can build the basic, who are you, what are you working on, and what resources do you want to share on an ongoing basis in the next three months.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can confirm that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In the meantime, maybe Eliza, we can see your platform and decide whether it makes sense to move people there with the expectation that we'll move again, which is always a real pain when it comes to software.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe the need is bad enough on WhatsApp that it makes sense to do that for a few months.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'd love to set up a time where I can give people a tour of it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's definitely a work in progress.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The Water Unity Network, as I've conceived it, is a

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is an organizational framework.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not a platform itself.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sort of, I can go on to, what are you, any network can go into any platform.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, it's a, it's an and also for me, yes and a yes.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, somebody may feel more comfortable in the world water community or someone else may feel better just to stay on the set.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know, those I'm in, you know, what are you, any network is in both spaces.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I foresee more complexity with more options.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am, I am trying to move people into the world water community.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's been a challenge to get people in there.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But yeah, anyway, to me, I think it's a bigger conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think we should have it because we're getting to that point where our own complexity

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is mind-boggling.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the things that we could do with WhatsApp in the meantime is just be more self-disciplined about what kinds of messages go into what kinds of chats.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know so for instance if there's operational messages where someone needs information from someone that could be a dedicated space versus what we tend to have which is a very wide-ranging set of communications on any topic in any channel and so maybe what what we can do as a medium goal is to define the sort of structure that I was just talking about from you know our intentional goals forward and then maybe set a few very dedicated spaces on WhatsApp for the comms that we need and then everything else can happen and sort of one other channel which might be very noisy and chaotic but at least the things that we need for for operational moving we can we can try to define that in the context that we have.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I agree with you because I may say maybe we need to have like a way to use that to what's up because sometimes you see a lot of messages which I may say useless to you personally, but again I will speak in the behalf of Africans I think again shifting to the other social sometime it's a big issue because I've been seeing people moving from what's up to Slack for example and because of many issues like internet and you know skills to use these platforms you know what's up is very easy sending a message read and again internet is another issue so you realize sometime at the end of time you send a message and people never see it send to email there are people who never check their emails so but what's up everyone goes there

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe I think we can keep them for the benefit of things Elisa mentioned.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** know, I agree with sometimes you miss data resources, but also we need maybe to keep both and have a strategy on how to use them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe admins should think about it.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So why don't we actually learn or you and I maybe meet next week and talk about both video strategy and also ops for communications?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I think making sure that we design this so that it works for the Africans that we're engaging is really important and certainly I don't have as much visibility into that as I'd like to.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we can take as the next item sort of you and I to do some mapping and thinking and then we can maybe report back on the next eAreaAfrica call for an update.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will say that the Water Unity Network already has

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is on what's up this community that we're talking about and yes it is it is chaotic mostly because people post in all of the groups rather than just one group so I think kind of training sessions or just messages just say please only post in this group if you have every single group rather than just one group which will get the messages as John said to all the people that are in that community so you know there's wait and so the one I would like to be part of that community if or that conversation between you and Leonard if I can and or if you're willing to and the other is we can instead of creating something entirely new because for the most part everybody is

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** already in the water unity network group.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can test what we want to do in there rather than creating something new.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just test it and see if it works and try things out as an experimental space because it's...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then from there, Ellie, you could guide us with your experiences to what's working or not working and then be able to create a more sort of direct work for ERA members specifically and the ERA Africa that allows us to not be so confusing.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like today I have three, four different meetings just on Africa, all from different groups.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I would love to try to either get our talent synced, each one has a slightly different topic, but...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know, to try to get some coordination between what we're doing that allows us to not duplicate our efforts in our time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, can we hear from John?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you guys hand them the list?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I've put one of my diagrams on the screen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think that this is a conversation that I think Ellie is going to take responsibility, but it should be Eliza and Leonard talking about the need for a platform for sharing and conversing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That is part of what I believe is our three branched plan to a successful project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've been talking about organizational capacity.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Eston has a story here about

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** social organization among the African groups.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He's going to get to us on that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But obviously, if we're going to pull ourselves together, we're going to have to have more organizational capacity than we currently do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We also need a vision of what we want to do and how it can be done.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think Ananda's document and the conversations we've had from this trip in Africa, begin to suggest that we have the beginnings of a plan where we're trying to go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If I had to summarize it just to snapshot my understanding, we think on the one hand there, we would like to put in place programs that would increase water security in Nakavali, and we want to continue tying together this network of regenerative hubs in Uganda and perhaps

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** come more generally.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And we do that by advancing particular techniques which are particularly near and dear to our hearts.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They're all nature-based solutions which need to be picked and adapted to really be appropriate and viable within that region.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Once we have a plan for organizational capacity and a plan for regenerative vision and how it could lead to successful change on the ground, we're in a good position to get funding, I think, because we have a lot of assets at this point.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so, this is just to say, this conversation that we could easily get drawn into is actually one to happen offline and come back to us.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And there are other conversations that are going to want to have happened.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, that's just my attempt to put us on the same page into

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** put a little conceptual discipline on our conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Speaking of conceptual discipline, Spear has had his hand up.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hey there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, sir.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just wanted to point out that there's been some funds released for a project in Nakavali and it'd be great to have a brief report on that from Diana and Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo, do you want to take that?

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is he still here?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you could stop screen sharing, John.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, of course.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Russ.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've taken long with us getting to this corner.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** been absolutely busy with the ongoing work here and with family issues but I'm happy again to join yeah to join the rest of the members and to give a few updates of what we're doing to make sure the people of Naki Valley.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm working with Diana plus other members to implement the regenerative processing development program for Naki Valley that we are so much looking into the waste management through compost and the biochar and also the conservation of the lake because we have around 6.2 hectares nearby Lake Naki Valley and it has been a damping site for almost a decade so a lot of erosion has been caused by that place and if you look at the water to consume good enough and I was there to witness how that's the water was so that the and that's it's even near by the water plants where the water that is distributed throughout where we stay

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** comes from.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are trying to clean up the whole of that land and restore that land so that people can have access to clean water, farmers can have access to organic fertilizer.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are working hard with the Diana.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So so far we have received over 15,000 US dollars to make sure we have the structures in place.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have the community engaged, we have stakeholders also involved in the program and we order some structures like kilns plus also build some facilities especially the compost and then also the belcher facility.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So all the work is ongoing so it's really a big plan but we are still somehow short of hands but we're still looking for more and but we have a lot going on and we shall keep sharing the reports whenever possible but actually something is being done on ground.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that is the brief what I can talk about but I'm happy to share more details with

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's another chance maybe with some photos with the written documents for us to catch up from there.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think that's if I can summarize maybe I don't know whether Diana can add something.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you, Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo and his team are doing some great work and you know the funding hasn't come as fast as we had hoped but the commitment from our non-profit has is just about $500 shy of its $10,000 goal.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that's moving a little slower than we hoped but it is moving and we'll definitely reach that goal in the next month.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** we worked with Colombo's team and his advisory board and I don't know if you

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh that he has established an advisory board which is a very helpful I think collection of individuals that have different expertise and are supporting the initiatives that are happening there.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's individuals from Australia and from Tanzania and Nigeria and Canada and several others from the US so it's nice to see the progress that he's made in establishing some very good governance and reporting processes and transparency which is really going to be helpful I think for the international community's viewpoint and understanding.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** exactly what people are supporting.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I really applaud Colombo and his team for just their professionalism and what they have done to date.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they did actually, his advisory board helped him put together a GoFundMe project and so that was initiated last week and I'm happy to share the link with everyone if anyone's interested.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I believe I got feedback from my board that perhaps it would be useful to also put this on Kickstarter just because it draws a different audience because this is actually a business startup and a sustainable business opportunity.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think we'll probably look at that as well for an option.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the funds are going through the nonprofit here in the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** though.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is a tax donation associated with this for anyone that's interested.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's the update from my side.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're just doing some great work.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The piece that I think Anand probably saw the location of the site and it's a really great site because it's adjacent to the lake and the office of the Prime Minister actually gave the team, the organization, even a little bit more than what was originally anticipated for the land size, so at 6.2 hectares.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Colombo is also working on another program relative to potentially bringing in a portable, solar-powered greenhouse.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that would be able to support fodder production for a small livestock production system.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that would be another piece that's incorporated onto a larger plan for the 6.2 hectares.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's, I think it's a great start.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unfortunately, the funding's coming a little slower than hoped, but I'm sure it will get there.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's a great report.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe allow me to introduce Kaluke, because I think it's the first time Kaluke joined us.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and by the way, Kaluke is the pure of Inuka.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you've heard about Inuka, the project of youth for nature, and he's doing amazing work in Kenya and around the world.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think he's doing media work with his media company and a lot of things.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you can introduce yourself to the team and that thanks for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Kaluki Paul Mutuku', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Kaluki Paul Mutuku', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** colleagues.

**{'display_name': 'Kaluki Paul Mutuku', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So very nice to meet all of you.

**{'display_name': 'Kaluki Paul Mutuku', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Calukki Paul and I'm a Kenyan based climate advocate and a very big supporter of youth engagement in the space, resourcing and also supporting their stories to amplify the narratives and their contribution in climate action and restoration initiatives.

**{'display_name': 'Kaluki Paul Mutuku', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As Leonard mentioned, I was his former colleague at Youth for Nature and I implemented the Inukafrika project, which is about scanning measurements for young people who really working at the intersection of their communities and landscapes to restore them, but also beyond restoration, seeing how we can match that with business opportunities and designing business models that work for them beyond just restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Kaluki Paul Mutuku', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** touring so it's pleasure to be here and I'm also working the media space trying to amplify change makers versus from across Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Kaluki Paul Mutuku', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I received this call from Leonard and I've been planning to meet you all so it's really a pleasure to be here today or tonight Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to meet you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks Garuki for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Finally just the call was two months ago just and then you make it today.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if anyone has questions but one thing that I wanted to focus on I mean to to have an action item is about the the structure that you showed us John.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe if you can have like a timeline because sometimes we talk and we decide but we do nothing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know if we can do like we have a timeline to do these things if like we need to set the fundraising committee who are going to be in this

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** committee like Eric mentioned and when they can meet and then for the other things as well when we can come up with something tangible I don't know if you have an idea on when we can you know have like at least the you know the timeline for these things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well I'm certainly happy to to do that so with regard to funding you can see that I've I've tried to capture what I've learned today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There are multiple parallel not very effective processes underway right now to try to find external sources of funding.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've got several people working relate related to the Panama project, Silop Bogdanov and Fred Jennings and I are looking

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Granting organizations, I think Ali has been doing some surveying also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think this group should think of those as resources to tap into, but should take its own responsibility for identifying and reaching out to funders for the projects that this group, however this group, has defined collectively wants to pursue.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It seems to me it is forever going to be the case that lots of people are looking for funding for lots of things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nonetheless, I think this elective has got a proposition that it is developing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know how it's going to fit together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I would suggest that I would be happy to be on the funding committee for what I'm calling ERA Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I have access to.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** really good funding database, which I can share and make available.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But we're going to need someone who's going to focus on that, who's going to try to coordinate those activities if we're going to get external funds.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm to jump in because my hand's been up for a while in my phone, so now I'm on the computer.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have been invited to submit to a site event in the prepcom for the conference for financing for development.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's going to be in Seville, Spain.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a UN conference and I'm submitting to the New York preparation event.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the end of April, and I would like to include ERA as a key ally in that proposal in terms of what I'm talking about there at the site event, if I get it, it's just a submission, but hopefully I can.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to actually share the abstract that I've written for it in the chat, and we can take that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, and when are those events?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The PREPCOM in New York City is April, there's a form first April 28th to 29th, and then the PREPCOM itself is the 30th to May 1st.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then the event in Seville, Spain is at the end of June, June 30th to July 3rd.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, this is the beginning of a time one, just to help us.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, cool.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there is another one in France.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've also been invited to on oceans And that's the June 9th through 13th or something No, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't believe it Yeah, so that that's good just saying that I'm putting this abstract in and we'd love to get feedback on it and And where was that oceans conference the in Nice Nuts nice nice Okay Okay, well I I'll I'm sorry Colombo And I'm I'm sure yes, okay if I could go first

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So just having a different idea regarding our reporting, because like we are saying, WhatsApp could not be an effective way to make sure whatever we are doing as members of ARRA, our activities and our reports are captured.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if I can just reflect on the tool that UNHCR here uses to make sure that all the partners around maybe the whole Uganda, all the activities are captured and reported on a timely basis.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they use a tool called Activity Info and have access to it, although I know how to create one.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So just a tool, we just keep putting in figures and you find this the way it gives you the whole summary of who is doing what and the all the achievements.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So instead of sending the reports on maybe on WhatsApp or email and then someone populates it, so I suggest if maybe you can look into some of these other resources, especially the one that they use, it's a very effective tool.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** because like now by the end of this month we shall be required to put the reports I mean to enter the data that's what we have achieved in the first quarter and you find in just one day after everyone has entered the data you'll find it's automatic that everything is produced because that should be one of our ways to make sure that our achievements as the members of RAA is achieved and once RAA publishes such reports you find it really gives another sense of visibility to the other external parties so my suggestion would be to conduct a system where all partners can just be reporting instead of using maybe WhatsApp or email so something like that that was separate I get to just having thank you so I'm looking at that tool right now and it looks great and it also looks like it has a cost associated which makes sense but it's certainly I mean so I can share my screen too and show it's

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It has a map that looks sort of graph-y, which is at least coherent with the plans that we talk about, too.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as far as reporting goes, I don't think that that is a super prominent use case for the moment, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Since we're more trying to get projects going than reporting on so many of them.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But at least with reporting the existing software that we have for NASA is able to do exactly that kind of work.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But this is sort of the press point for the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You're not showing the screen, know.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, it says I am.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, you are.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You are, John.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you, Burton.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, you know, it's really interesting to me to hear that UNHCR, which I think of as being a very...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** bureaucracy actually has an effective tool that Colombo is recommending.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think their tools are good.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if their processes are internally.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I want to point out that $500 is real money.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** On the other hand, building a platform is a real adventure that takes six months to a year, which is also worth more than $500 and yet we don't have that either.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** if there's actually an existing tool, would be a global organization because the price would be 3,700 plus every user has an extra.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it would be quite right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see that.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, Colombo, how is it that you have access to it?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now it's the admin that gives access to us so for us don't pay anything so they're the ones that give us access so all the costs are made by them so for us just have they create the for us accounts in the info and we have the login details so like every quarter we just enter the information then after a period of time like because we expect the report for quarter one to be out by 11th of April next month so just enter information the pricing and other things that's up to them so for us we don't meet any costs so combo given given what we are trying to do is it possible that the admin would give us accounts the same way he's given your accounts yeah the condition is you should just be working within Uganda so because the reports on activities of Uganda and as they publish the reports is the reports of you in it's era in Uganda

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, we are working within Yukonda, but so I think it's limited to because Colombo had a project that was funded through UNHCR.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** therefore he has to report through their reporting tool.

**{'display_name': 'Diana Doheny', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's the connection.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a it's a non trivial question.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, so I worked briefly with the Red Cross as a volunteer.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the main activities that they do is collect data because that's how they do fundraising, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they will find the number of fires that any local Red Cross has responded to successfully and round that up and then put that as part of the Red Cross's activities that they then seek funding for.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't think we would want to push that data into another database because that would sort of mitigate or dilute what ERA can say it's doing, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If UNHCR is also doing the same thing because we probably can't say we we are the.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the originating factor there.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what I wanted to say and why I raised my hand to begin with was it really looks like there are, where our sort of structure and goals are maturing and it's really a good time to start to define what our kind of organizational strategies need to be.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm hearing a few different topic areas that we need to start thinking about.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Fundraising is one of them, communications and how we do that as a team and what platforms we use is obviously a big one.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Social media programs actually on the ground.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what I think would be helpful and I'll try to make a document to structure this is to get any other ideas that we have in terms of what ERAs should be doing unless it's getting done.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we can have conversations about what that looks like and how we can activate a network response.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I think for instance, Eliza, it's great that you have these opportunities to present in France.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we also want to be activating, as John was saying, Leonard and others in the African context to look for their own grants, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there might be some training that needs to happen in between.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we can identify what that looks like, then we can start to fill in the gaps.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I could do fundraising training, and then Leonard would not be waiting for us to get started and maybe he would even be able to find grants.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what are those leverage points?

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like that's kind of what I'm trying to figure out.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if anyone has thoughts on that, send them my way and I'll put some structure around it and report back in our next call.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Perfect, nice.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Ellie.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a question.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're now into the next hour and the ERA Uganda call is still on my calendar.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** are we still having those calls?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if not, can we lose them?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And is that this call now?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That we're now...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Into that call so yeah question.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a question for John.

**{'display_name': 'Ellie Young', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, I have the same question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, all I know is that I did see that someone said they were in that meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I'm going to why don't we share the link.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Go there and then debate that question without leaving anyone out.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Perfect.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So you're coming to the link.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's probably on your calendar also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll leave it there for a moment and see you there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** See you there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks everyone for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here go.

## 💬 Transcript

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can move smoothly.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think it's a challenge for so many organizations, everyone who is here, but we are still just thinking, or we can still think on how we can use even the small we have and the voices we have, and then we can see how we can fundraise some money for our initiatives.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe Michael will bring some, I don't know, because he said he has some small funding.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but it's a challenge.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't know if Jon has something to talk about it, because he has been working on the mapping of all our initiatives, and he did a great graphic.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe, Jon, if you can talk about the graphic or tell us, you know, about it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, happy to.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If I can get my computer to cooperate.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So this is the latest version of the graphic here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And the basic notion is here that I'm just trying to track, and it's actually pretty complicated, the country, city, or town, the particular people, what kinds of projects they're working on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And you can see that training is too general a term, but there you can see it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then the various organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think what I'm going to be doing is separating external organizations from internal organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have a spreadsheet, which you can all edit, which I will give you in a moment.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** have have have You

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** where it would be very helpful to get some help on this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So here's Sankey data, and this is the raw data, and I'm going to give you the link to this, and I'm just going to suggest that you add rows with correct information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So here's the chat, here's the link.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you for doing this, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is tremendous.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And, you know, with your permission, if you're willing, it would be helpful for me to just go over it in real time with you to see what kinds of changes I can make.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm sort of developing a tool for this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And for the moment, so Marius is here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have Marius associated with Uh...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Uh...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The Omoja Foundation, and Biochar, Biogen, and Permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are those the right three things, Marius?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or is Biogen and Biochar the same thing?

**{'display_name': 'MARIUS IRAGI', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Those are three different things, yes?

**{'display_name': 'MARIUS IRAGI', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'MARIUS IRAGI', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm going to start by name here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, that was Marius.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Balonza.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is Balonza here?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He was.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But he's not here right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nonetheless, you all know about him.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have him in Bukavu DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** His organization is On Time Aid.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But what are his projects?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently, Balanza has needed to leave Bukavu for obvious reasons, and he's now on a farm near Kansasha, and he's working on turning this farm into a regenerative agriculture project and a watershed restoration teaching.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And it's a working farm already?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, and his organization is on time aid?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's fine.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, this is helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it was in Bukavu.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I haven't asked him how it's, if it's translating to a new area of DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I understand.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I understand.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** understand.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it would be helpful, because there's many different angles of this, from my understanding, a very large number of all of these organizations are helping small-scale, smallholder farmers, to produce food, and so just in like either tree planting or assisting smallholder farmers to grow regeneratively with agroforestry or other regenerative methods, I think we would find a very large number, even though the project descriptions of the organizations may look like

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's many, many different things happening.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's probably less, and I think you could probably summarize it a lot, too.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Water purification, helping small-scale farmers convert to regenerative agroforestry, tree planting, and then there are nuances, education.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The irony is that I think most of these projects hit all of these points.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so I think what's going to happen is that we're going to go from a specific project, so that they don't all fall into the same generic description, and then those projects will converge on these few companies.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Common Elements.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Leonce similarly said, you know, basically it's food security, water security, and human development.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so what I'm thinking now is that I need to find some way of having all the specific projects, each of them will probably converge on all three of those legs in another, in the last tier.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And the following tier is probably where outside support organizations will sort of plug in based on the mission.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I agree that, well, does Leonce's category sound right to you?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Food security?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Water security?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he called it poverty reduction.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would call it human development.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But another way to think about it is people people people

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Planets and Climates, which I think is a particular way of couching it, which works in particular for the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I would welcome some help wrestling with these terminological issues because they end up shaping the visual, which people seem to like.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One thing is that while all of the groups are touching upon these key points, they're all at different stages of development, and the emphasis of the project that they're currently working on is generally distinct.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** right, Edward has his farm, Kareem does not, but he wants one, right, so there's, but he's doing amazing things with the blue barrel system, so there's, you know, the emphasis rather than the key core function.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I the emphasis of, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm happy to.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, I think what you had was more accurate for that column, which was core function.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, And more stages of development, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** emphasis of development.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And a key part of this for me is in the human development of capacity building.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, that's what, what, um, MUTASA was talking about.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like, we, we have all these pieces, but we need this to improve our capacity for doing this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, well, this is what happens.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So the scope is expanding here, um, which is good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Not all of these things fit into a graphic, but that's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, let's, let's use this to focus.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For attention on these themes, and later we can figure out how exactly to represent it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Deo, your hand is up.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, I just noticed a project, you put government.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was like, is this something that has to be editable later?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How would you describe your project or projects?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My project has been on advocacy, climate education, agroforestry, food security, and advocating for renewable energy.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Those have been my kind of, you know, tematic area, tree planting.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, those are what I push in most here with the government, even with the partners.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, under the food security, we'll go under women, youth empowerment, like that, like that.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, see how it stops, so depending on what.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's available, that's it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've got it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So for me, this is a good point, because what he just named off to me is his emphasis or core function, whereas the specific project, like, it's like, you're planting trees in here, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's more the specific project that, like, current project maybe, rather than project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think you're right about that, that the project should be a specific program or place that is getting something invested in.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then your point is that, what's the right way to do this, I wonder?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let's get the data, and then I can scratch my head.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So let's just go through this again with the people who are present.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Deo, Eliza's point would be that these are your contributions, if you will, your areas of expertise and emphasis, but they're...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Our specific projects, this is one of the challenges we have, we want to be able to say, this is happening here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, can you name your projects or programs?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, tree planting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In a particular place?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Tree planting, we are doing tree planting in Taraba State, back in the safe forest reserve.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the other one we are also doing is...

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Every month, Environmental Watch, which is every month's program, we call in the stakeholders of the government, researchers, scientists, activists to come share their experience.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ask the question, the audience calling from different parts of the country to add into the...

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, hold it, hold it, hold it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What was that called?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Environmental Watch.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Environmental Watch is the program.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The tree planting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have that one here.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think those are what we are currently working on this year, that we are doing this year.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think I appreciate this process.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So here we've got your themes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here you have your specific projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Edward is not here, but I think there we know that his hamlet is the specific project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so let's move.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** On Kalombo.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have Kalombo associated with RED and with the Nakavali Woodlock project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is Kalombo still with us?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Kalombo.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Started, but are likely or trying to happen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The second level is, does it go into the same table?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How do we organize the data?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I have the impression from this discussion that everybody appreciates being able to put this all in one place.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think it is a worthy project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then the third level is, course, how do we summarize and visualize it?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And we can struggle with that later.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just super quickly, Jon, I think we could just say current projects and projects and developing projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, you're quite right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That means that every project...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is where you start designing a database.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I will use this information to try to create...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** about Why will

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A database of this sort, specifically for Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For example, if I shared a spreadsheet, would you all be willing and able to add data to the spreadsheet?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What might be easier, Jon, is to create a form that feeds the spreadsheet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The problem with that, well, yes, I know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, because I think for the spreadsheet, people will not.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe we can use the form, because I have even some other letters.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe we can use the form.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's what I've seen people try to fear.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But most of people, some of the people, they don't know how to use the sheet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And maybe we can

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's what I was afraid of.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe, Jon, also something that might be also useful is, for example, for the maybe the form, it will allow us maybe to have, for example, for the project or programs, maybe we can have some category where people will fill before they add the program itself where it falls.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For example, we may have the common programs, for example, if it's tree planting or if it's agroforestry or if it is something related to capacity building the training, somebody can select that.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** later on, the following up question, maybe another part is after maybe picking, then they have to write the information again in that program.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It will help you in summarizing some of this information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's easy to say.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's hard to do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** As a matter of fact, I have created something along these lines.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me just see if it still exists.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And see if it's an example.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nope, that one is deleted.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also we have the sheet, Jon, maybe we can edit that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we will do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me show you this form and let me know whether this, you would all be willing and able to do this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is a form and you can submit it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You would click here and you would find your own name.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If your name didn't exist, you would put it here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For example, Joshua Lazer is not here yet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here would be a list of specific projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But for that one, I think we would just give it a specific name.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** we go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And here, you would pick an organization.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And if the organization doesn't exist, you would add it here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Anything else?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we are going to need location, and I'll fix that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And here we have status, and I chose to do, meaning something else, to develop, in progress, meaning I think we should have in progress but not started, and then ongoing, and then completed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, I would absolutely be ecstatic if we included watershed and catchment basin.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They could be in the scene.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, that's fair enough.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So how does that work, though?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Because if you I mean, for example, if you wanted to give a list of watersheds, then they could pick their watershed.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, they're going to say, well, I'm on, you know, Winding Creek and we're just so so I do have a list.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not a comprehensive list, but I'm starting to build it of the, at least the major rivers of the world.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if people can, like, it's easy to do the research, but even if they put Nile, you know, if they know they go into the Nile or their creek, we can find it, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the important thing is, is the water draining into Lake Victoria, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, it's the catchment basin.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the smaller watersheds inform the bigger catchment basins.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I understand the geography, and I understand the value.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know how to put it into a form.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I mean, if people don't know, then that's okay, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not like everybody will know, and so that might be a blank, so we can easily go and see who's the blank.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I would be willing to make a personal call and say, let's find your watershed, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's part of the process of education.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is great input, great feedback.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've gotten sucked into database development and maintenance for the last couple of weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm a little worried about where this is going.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Am I...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do any of us have...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The base competence beside me?

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Beyond spreadsheets?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Beyond spreadsheets, yes, because the trick here is that we do need some structure here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, this is a well-defined problem, and it's a well...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me just pause.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is this busy work, or is this really valuable?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's essential, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'd like to hear a few more voices, because I don't want to spend time building it and then have no one actually fill it in.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, it's very important, and this form is really nice.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will share the form that I have, and I think it's very crucial, actually, very crucial.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Now, is there anyone who would like...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** To get database expertise, who would like to work with me on this?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's where I was going with it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, is that you, Eliza?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I heard you, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thing is, we have to pay Leonard for his time, and sadly, we have limited funds, so here we are.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm sorry, Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What about Ellie?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Isn't that her thing?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What about Ellie?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, well, that's, and where is Ellie, by the way?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But that's another question.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, she should certainly advise us, probably.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would be happy to assist you in the process of learning.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So learning will be my payment, so if there is any way that I can help, please.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** next,機械?

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay,

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you, Joshua.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Joshua, give me your email in the chat, and I will follow up with you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it would be terrific if someone from Africa really began to know how to do this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And while I'm ambivalent about the time it takes me to do the database maintenance, I'm enthusiastic about time spent giving other people the ability to do it in the service of what we're doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's a nice offer, Joshua.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Put your email in the chat, please.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Already done that, sir.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, this has been a useful exercise.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Our work is not done, but I think this is enough for today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll try to mature.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll this a little bit, and then I'll reach out to Joshua and we'll try to take it forward.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Moses says he's willing to learn as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Who?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll try to figure it out.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll be, I really want to learn as well, so I have shared my email address in the chat box.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you both.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** See what we can do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe we are.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Back to you, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we are also, at the end of time, I think maybe we can close, but I had something that I want to share, maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If people can allow me, like, five minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Please.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I wanted to talk about the social media things, because in the last meetings we talked about how Africa members can share their stories and maybe how they can engage through social media.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I wanted to tell them, maybe if I can share my screen, my meaning.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And first, yeah, I wanted to say that we have accounts on different socials.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is our TikTok, actually.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been putting some short videos, and as you can see, we have four followers and 50 likes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But honestly, it's not bad at all, because I think maybe no one knows it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if you guys are on TikTok, please go there and check.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Follow and share, because like the videos that I've been putting, you can see some of them got 100, you know, almost 200, and yeah, we reached some people, like some numbers of people through the reads.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, on the others, like, like this is X, we also have few followers, but not really few, but we need to keep improving.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what I want to tell people is that they need to go there and check and follow and whatever, like any time when you post, please remember maybe to tag us so that you can share the stories.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll reshare your posts.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we are also on Instagram, we have like 157, and on Facebook, and everywhere it's EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also, we are using...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** YouTube, LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think LinkedIn is more active than any of these.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So where we have almost 2,500.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So yeah, to encourage you guys to always tag us, share our posts, go ahead and check, because we need more engagement.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, maybe in the future, we can use these platforms to share our stories, like African stories, like the video that I'm working on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be amazing to share the stories from, you know, the people that we met.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also some of the stories of what you are doing in your countries.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's very useful.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I wanted to shout out about this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I want to point out that if you go to the bottom of our website, every page.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Every page has got links to our LinkedIn, our Facebook, our YouTube, Instagram, Twitter.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We should add TikTok here, but if you click on one of these, it will take you directly to our place, and then you can just click on follow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And he's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Please do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hope to see them engaging with us on social media.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, thank you so much for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, can you give us the link so we can find it easily?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It what?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The link for the TikTok.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me get to you now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Second, okay, oh, it's here in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and as much as we can kind of interconnect on all the social media, the better, and especially LinkedIn, because there's a lot of good conversations happening on LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and I've seen a water unit network on LinkedIn, so thanks for being with us, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, everybody, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I will be putting the recording into the calendar invite that brought us all here, and Leonard, you can share it on WhatsApp and through other channels.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, goodbye, everyone.

## 💬 Transcript

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can move smoothly.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think it's a challenge for so many organizations, everyone who is here, but we are still just thinking, or we can still think on how we can use even the small we have and the voices we have, and then we can see how we can fundraise some money for our initiatives.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe Michael will bring some, I don't know, because he said he has some small funding.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but it's a challenge.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't know if Jon has something to talk about it, because he has been working on the mapping of all our initiatives, and he did a great graphic.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe, Jon, if you can talk about the graphic or tell us, you know, about it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, happy to.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If I can get my computer to cooperate.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So this is the latest version of the graphic here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And the basic notion is here that I'm just trying to track, and it's actually pretty complicated, the country, city, or town, the particular people, what kinds of projects they're working on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And you can see that training is too general a term, but there you can see it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then the various organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think what I'm going to be doing is separating external organizations from internal organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have a spreadsheet, which you can all edit, which I will give you in a moment.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** have have have You

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** where it would be very helpful to get some help on this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So here's Sankey data, and this is the raw data, and I'm going to give you the link to this, and I'm just going to suggest that you add rows with correct information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So here's the chat, here's the link.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you for doing this, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is tremendous.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And, you know, with your permission, if you're willing, it would be helpful for me to just go over it in real time with you to see what kinds of changes I can make.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm sort of developing a tool for this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And for the moment, so Marius is here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have Marius associated with Uh...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Uh...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The Omoja Foundation, and Biochar, Biogen, and Permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are those the right three things, Marius?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or is Biogen and Biochar the same thing?

**{'display_name': 'MARIUS IRAGI', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Those are three different things, yes?

**{'display_name': 'MARIUS IRAGI', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'MARIUS IRAGI', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm going to start by name here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, that was Marius.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Balonza.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is Balonza here?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** He was.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But he's not here right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nonetheless, you all know about him.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have him in Bukavu DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** His organization is On Time Aid.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But what are his projects?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently, Balanza has needed to leave Bukavu for obvious reasons, and he's now on a farm near Kansasha, and he's working on turning this farm into a regenerative agriculture project and a watershed restoration teaching.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And it's a working farm already?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, and his organization is on time aid?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's fine.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, this is helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it was in Bukavu.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I haven't asked him how it's, if it's translating to a new area of DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I understand.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I understand.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** understand.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it would be helpful, because there's many different angles of this, from my understanding, a very large number of all of these organizations are helping small-scale, smallholder farmers, to produce food, and so just in like either tree planting or assisting smallholder farmers to grow regeneratively with agroforestry or other regenerative methods, I think we would find a very large number, even though the project descriptions of the organizations may look like

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's many, many different things happening.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's probably less, and I think you could probably summarize it a lot, too.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Water purification, helping small-scale farmers convert to regenerative agroforestry, tree planting, and then there are nuances, education.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The irony is that I think most of these projects hit all of these points.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so I think what's going to happen is that we're going to go from a specific project, so that they don't all fall into the same generic description, and then those projects will converge on these few companies.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Common Elements.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Leonce similarly said, you know, basically it's food security, water security, and human development.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so what I'm thinking now is that I need to find some way of having all the specific projects, each of them will probably converge on all three of those legs in another, in the last tier.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And the following tier is probably where outside support organizations will sort of plug in based on the mission.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I agree that, well, does Leonce's category sound right to you?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Food security?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Water security?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he called it poverty reduction.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would call it human development.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But another way to think about it is people people people

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Planets and Climates, which I think is a particular way of couching it, which works in particular for the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I would welcome some help wrestling with these terminological issues because they end up shaping the visual, which people seem to like.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One thing is that while all of the groups are touching upon these key points, they're all at different stages of development, and the emphasis of the project that they're currently working on is generally distinct.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** right, Edward has his farm, Kareem does not, but he wants one, right, so there's, but he's doing amazing things with the blue barrel system, so there's, you know, the emphasis rather than the key core function.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I the emphasis of, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm happy to.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, I think what you had was more accurate for that column, which was core function.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, And more stages of development, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** emphasis of development.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And a key part of this for me is in the human development of capacity building.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, that's what, what, um, MUTASA was talking about.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like, we, we have all these pieces, but we need this to improve our capacity for doing this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, well, this is what happens.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So the scope is expanding here, um, which is good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Not all of these things fit into a graphic, but that's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, let's, let's use this to focus.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For attention on these themes, and later we can figure out how exactly to represent it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Deo, your hand is up.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, I just noticed a project, you put government.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was like, is this something that has to be editable later?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How would you describe your project or projects?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My project has been on advocacy, climate education, agroforestry, food security, and advocating for renewable energy.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Those have been my kind of, you know, tematic area, tree planting.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, those are what I push in most here with the government, even with the partners.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, under the food security, we'll go under women, youth empowerment, like that, like that.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, see how it stops, so depending on what.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's available, that's it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've got it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So for me, this is a good point, because what he just named off to me is his emphasis or core function, whereas the specific project, like, it's like, you're planting trees in here, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's more the specific project that, like, current project maybe, rather than project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think you're right about that, that the project should be a specific program or place that is getting something invested in.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then your point is that, what's the right way to do this, I wonder?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let's get the data, and then I can scratch my head.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So let's just go through this again with the people who are present.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Deo, Eliza's point would be that these are your contributions, if you will, your areas of expertise and emphasis, but they're...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Our specific projects, this is one of the challenges we have, we want to be able to say, this is happening here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, can you name your projects or programs?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, tree planting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In a particular place?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Tree planting, we are doing tree planting in Taraba State, back in the safe forest reserve.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the other one we are also doing is...

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Every month, Environmental Watch, which is every month's program, we call in the stakeholders of the government, researchers, scientists, activists to come share their experience.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ask the question, the audience calling from different parts of the country to add into the...

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, hold it, hold it, hold it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What was that called?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Environmental Watch.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Environmental Watch is the program.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The tree planting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have that one here.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think those are what we are currently working on this year, that we are doing this year.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think I appreciate this process.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So here we've got your themes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here you have your specific projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Edward is not here, but I think there we know that his hamlet is the specific project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so let's move.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** On Kalombo.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have Kalombo associated with RED and with the Nakavali Woodlock project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is Kalombo still with us?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Kalombo.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is that accurate, would you say?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, it is.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in red, maybe I can just maybe mention what the components that we have in red.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, we have biochar production.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have compost production.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, bamboo planting.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is also stormwater management.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And lastly, we have the cleaning up of Lake Nakey Valley.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Lake Nakey Valley cleanup.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have up of Lake Nakey Valley.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Projects with Smallholder Farmers.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you for doing this.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can also maybe put in one place, okay?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So let me just say, what Joshua has done here is extremely helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've got locations, we have organization, we have specific items, and then in this column, we have outside supporting organizations, and what is this?

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is this an organization, Joshua?

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They call Care for Conservation.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** is an organization.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** While we're just collecting the raw facts, there any more?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Dave, is your hand up on purpose?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I just want to say, like some of us, some of the organizations that are expecting projects, or they are waiting on some projects to start up, is it after this, whenever we, do we have the ability to update the data when we start such projects, like carbon credits, agroforestry, some other agroforestry projects that are waiting just to be signed and implementation will start soon, but can we add that or we should wait?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** See, when the project starts fully, then we update our information.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just want to ask about that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, it's a good question, and there are three levels to that question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One level is, do we want to know about it?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, it would be very helpful to know about projects that happen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Started, but are likely or trying to happen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The second level is, does it go into the same table?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How do we organize the data?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I have the impression from this discussion that everybody appreciates being able to put this all in one place.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think it is a worthy project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then the third level is, course, how do we summarize and visualize it?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And we can struggle with that later.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just super quickly, Jon, I think we could just say current projects and projects and developing projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, you're quite right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That means that every project...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is where you start designing a database.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I will use this information to try to create...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** about Why will

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A database of this sort, specifically for Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For example, if I shared a spreadsheet, would you all be willing and able to add data to the spreadsheet?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What might be easier, Jon, is to create a form that feeds the spreadsheet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The problem with that, well, yes, I know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, because I think for the spreadsheet, people will not.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe we can use the form, because I have even some other letters.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe we can use the form.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's what I've seen people try to fear.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But most of people, some of the people, they don't know how to use the sheet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And maybe we can

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's what I was afraid of.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe, Jon, also something that might be also useful is, for example, for the maybe the form, it will allow us maybe to have, for example, for the project or programs, maybe we can have some category where people will fill before they add the program itself where it falls.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For example, we may have the common programs, for example, if it's tree planting or if it's agroforestry or if it is something related to capacity building the training, somebody can select that.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** later on, the following up question, maybe another part is after maybe picking, then they have to write the information again in that program.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It will help you in summarizing some of this information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's easy to say.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's hard to do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** As a matter of fact, I have created something along these lines.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me just see if it still exists.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And see if it's an example.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nope, that one is deleted.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also we have the sheet, Jon, maybe we can edit that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we will do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me show you this form and let me know whether this, you would all be willing and able to do this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is a form and you can submit it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You would click here and you would find your own name.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If your name didn't exist, you would put it here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For example, Joshua Lazer is not here yet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here would be a list of specific projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But for that one, I think we would just give it a specific name.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** we go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And here, you would pick an organization.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And if the organization doesn't exist, you would add it here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Anything else?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we are going to need location, and I'll fix that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And here we have status, and I chose to do, meaning something else, to develop, in progress, meaning I think we should have in progress but not started, and then ongoing, and then completed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, I would absolutely be ecstatic if we included watershed and catchment basin.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They could be in the scene.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, that's fair enough.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So how does that work, though?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Because if you I mean, for example, if you wanted to give a list of watersheds, then they could pick their watershed.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, they're going to say, well, I'm on, you know, Winding Creek and we're just so so I do have a list.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not a comprehensive list, but I'm starting to build it of the, at least the major rivers of the world.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if people can, like, it's easy to do the research, but even if they put Nile, you know, if they know they go into the Nile or their creek, we can find it, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the important thing is, is the water draining into Lake Victoria, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, it's the catchment basin.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the smaller watersheds inform the bigger catchment basins.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I understand the geography, and I understand the value.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know how to put it into a form.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I mean, if people don't know, then that's okay, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not like everybody will know, and so that might be a blank, so we can easily go and see who's the blank.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I would be willing to make a personal call and say, let's find your watershed, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's part of the process of education.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is great input, great feedback.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've gotten sucked into database development and maintenance for the last couple of weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm a little worried about where this is going.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Am I...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do any of us have...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The base competence beside me?

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Beyond spreadsheets?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Beyond spreadsheets, yes, because the trick here is that we do need some structure here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, this is a well-defined problem, and it's a well...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me just pause.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is this busy work, or is this really valuable?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's essential, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'd like to hear a few more voices, because I don't want to spend time building it and then have no one actually fill it in.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, it's very important, and this form is really nice.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will share the form that I have, and I think it's very crucial, actually, very crucial.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Now, is there anyone who would like...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** To get database expertise, who would like to work with me on this?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's where I was going with it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, is that you, Eliza?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I heard you, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thing is, we have to pay Leonard for his time, and sadly, we have limited funds, so here we are.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm sorry, Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What about Ellie?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Isn't that her thing?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What about Ellie?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, well, that's, and where is Ellie, by the way?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But that's another question.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, she should certainly advise us, probably.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would be happy to assist you in the process of learning.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So learning will be my payment, so if there is any way that I can help, please.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** next,機械?

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay,

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you, Joshua.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Joshua, give me your email in the chat, and I will follow up with you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it would be terrific if someone from Africa really began to know how to do this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And while I'm ambivalent about the time it takes me to do the database maintenance, I'm enthusiastic about time spent giving other people the ability to do it in the service of what we're doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's a nice offer, Joshua.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Put your email in the chat, please.

**{'display_name': 'Joshua Laizer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Already done that, sir.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, this has been a useful exercise.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Our work is not done, but I think this is enough for today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll try to mature.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll this a little bit, and then I'll reach out to Joshua and we'll try to take it forward.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Moses says he's willing to learn as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Who?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll try to figure it out.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll be, I really want to learn as well, so I have shared my email address in the chat box.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you both.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** See what we can do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe we are.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Back to you, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we are also, at the end of time, I think maybe we can close, but I had something that I want to share, maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If people can allow me, like, five minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Please.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I wanted to talk about the social media things, because in the last meetings we talked about how Africa members can share their stories and maybe how they can engage through social media.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I wanted to tell them, maybe if I can share my screen, my meaning.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And first, yeah, I wanted to say that we have accounts on different socials.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is our TikTok, actually.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been putting some short videos, and as you can see, we have four followers and 50 likes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But honestly, it's not bad at all, because I think maybe no one knows it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if you guys are on TikTok, please go there and check.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Follow and share, because like the videos that I've been putting, you can see some of them got 100, you know, almost 200, and yeah, we reached some people, like some numbers of people through the reads.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, on the others, like, like this is X, we also have few followers, but not really few, but we need to keep improving.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what I want to tell people is that they need to go there and check and follow and whatever, like any time when you post, please remember maybe to tag us so that you can share the stories.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll reshare your posts.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we are also on Instagram, we have like 157, and on Facebook, and everywhere it's EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also, we are using...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** YouTube, LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think LinkedIn is more active than any of these.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So where we have almost 2,500.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So yeah, to encourage you guys to always tag us, share our posts, go ahead and check, because we need more engagement.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, maybe in the future, we can use these platforms to share our stories, like African stories, like the video that I'm working on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be amazing to share the stories from, you know, the people that we met.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also some of the stories of what you are doing in your countries.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's very useful.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I wanted to shout out about this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I want to point out that if you go to the bottom of our website, every page.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Every page has got links to our LinkedIn, our Facebook, our YouTube, Instagram, Twitter.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We should add TikTok here, but if you click on one of these, it will take you directly to our place, and then you can just click on follow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And he's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Please do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hope to see them engaging with us on social media.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, thank you so much for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, can you give us the link so we can find it easily?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It what?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The link for the TikTok.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me get to you now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Second, okay, oh, it's here in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and as much as we can kind of interconnect on all the social media, the better, and especially LinkedIn, because there's a lot of good conversations happening on LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and I've seen a water unit network on LinkedIn, so thanks for being with us, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, everybody, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This, I didn't realize this meeting was actually on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me just see what's going on here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, and I are in the Zoom.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Amanda will join us, and we can say hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, hi.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Have we met before, Mtokani?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, sir.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You have to remind me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Where are you from?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And how are things going for you there?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I imagine you're seeing more and more people from the DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it is, as all we know, the critical issue of insecurity which is going on in Congo.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Normally our part of northern part, eastern part, Goma, so where there are massive killing which is going on.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So many refugees are fleeing from the Cambria.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And coming to Kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some are fleeing from Kakuma, others are going from Tanzania.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And are the authorities...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, other, they went to Burundi, because there was a camp there in Burundi.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And is the camp keeping up with the demand?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It must be very stressful.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but the demand, nowadays the demand are very few, to the huge number of the refugees which they are coming in.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they support, are few.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As we know, when the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** aid did not, it no longer supported the people, now it is a critical issue for the country who are hosting refugees to support the refugees.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is why even here in Kenya we have a challenge of food, food, food of food station.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like now we've been told in June and July that mean we will not be given food.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, we are trying to imagine how the people that are most out of the refugees.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm very sorry to hear that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ananda, hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm just catching up with them to Connie.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We just started a few minutes ago.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was here and then left because it seemed no one was coming.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, that's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm not sure what happened with this meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It was on my calendar.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I didn't see a reminder from Leonard, so I didn't show up and he's not here either.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think we need to put things together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I wonder, Ananda, we now have a crisis-oriented appeal up where we're trying to raise money, but we haven't really been pushing it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you know what the status is?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the status is, I think we, I think that we...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** again.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's Let's Let's Let's Let's

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Upped $190, and it hasn't been going up, and it was destined to help people that are still in the Congo.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if I've posted anything about that on LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you want to give me the link, and I'll do that now?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'll try to find out.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you want to give me the to find out.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There it is.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There it is.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Opening it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There it is.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So we are the fiscal sponsors.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonce is, I think, the point person in Africa for this.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Takani is in Kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Kenya, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's in Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Takani?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Kakuma, Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And where were you originally from?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm originally from Congo DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's where the main source these days of all the refugees that are flooding the camps everywhere are all coming out of Congo.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How long have you been in Kenya, Takani?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I had been in Kenya for 15 years.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** next next to And.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, okay, so it's been quite a while, but it's getting worse and worse, like there's more and more people coming?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then, and you were saying that they're not going to be giving any food or money to the refugee?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, so people are coming and they're given nothing?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you have agriculture programs to grow food there?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, they're mostly agriculture with the, mostly refugees are practiced here to the permaculture where we grow only vegetable.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you, do you grow, you must grow corn and beans?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, so due to, yeah, ni kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have a critical season because there's no rain enough.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We don't have enough rain in kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We use water for irrigation.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's what we are using.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can grow only vegetables, but we can't grow beans, maize, maybe in the other part of Kenya where they can grow all those crops.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What about trees, tree crops?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we can, that one they can work.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I saw when I was visiting that in the places where they were growing crops underneath the trees, it was better for the dry climate because the trees keep the soil covered.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'mItalian for

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also bring water up from deeper down?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What are you doing about, do you have like nurseries where people propagate the tree crops or seed banks?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So for the trees, we have some organization here which provide trees.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But nowadays, due to the less funds, they no longer prepare the nursery for trees.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, most people, they used to go there and take trees and they come on their plants along the road, even they compared on their compound.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But due to the cut of the edge, now the 6th January, they did not provide any trees.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And are people able to learn the skills to propagate themselves, the trees that are already there?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because that would definitely be a way to go towards more self-sufficiency to try to learn from, to expand what's already there so that it improves the situation.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have seed banks?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, have prepared, we have seed beds for spinach with the local, with the local vegetable which we use here in camp, mostly in camp, we use spinach, we use kale, okra.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And other African vegetable which used to grow.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you collect the seeds and share the seeds so new farmers can start?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you said that you're also practicing permaculture?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, I practice permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's people that train others in the methods of permaculture?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And do they practice water harvesting, like water earthworks, to collect water in the ground?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we used to dig the hole, then we used a generator for pumping the water.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But you have, like, they teach you in permaculture to analyze.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Analyze with.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** When it rains, where the water could collect, and then to deepen those holes so that more water collects and sinks in the land?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we have, you know, here in Kakuma, we have some refugees who have a skill in agriculture, but only the problem which they are facing, they don't have support to support them to explore what they have in agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because we have some, like, we have some Congolese who have to study agriculture in the University of Nkongo, but reaching here in Kakuma, but they don't have the support for them to develop the skill which they have in agriculture, but they don't have the support to use that skill.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, those are the people whom I collaborate with, with one of them, who is supporting me in preparing the seed, training the youth and those teen mothers.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Which you are basically focused with, so how they can plant, how they can watering the vegetables, which they are planting like that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What kind of support do you mean, Mtokani?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What would it take for their skills to be more widely spread around?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the support most refugees they are facing, like I shared, the economical support, the economical support for them, they can be motivated, the skill which they have, they can share to others.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Fear that money is always valuable, and we wish we had more to share, and we're trying to figure out how to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But meanwhile, I'm wondering if there are other ways we can help.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, my.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm catching up.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm looking at the pictures you shared last month, and I see that it is a difficult situation.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Was that where they were shooting people for protesting?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, that's right.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, people are protesting because there's no food.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How they're going to survive without food.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is a critical challenge that they are facing.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have orphans, we have disability people.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How they're going to survive while there's no food.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is what leads other people to protect themselves, but there's no solution with that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, Tokani, I see that I don't have, it doesn't look like you are in our database.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I would like to get a little bit of information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do have your email.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me just see.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have email.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Takani Saleh?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And let's just say Takani Saleh.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You're in Kakuma?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're in Kakuma?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm in Kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Any particular town or village?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kakuma is the town.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's the town.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's in Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How large is Kakuma?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How many people live there?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in Kakuma, we have more than 3,000 refugees.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have more than 3,000 refugees.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's only the number of the refugees.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I don't know exactly the number of the host community.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We know we are closer to the host community of Kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** see.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** see.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I I see.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** was

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Town, but you also have 2,000 refugees living there, and it's managed by UNHCR.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And how does it work there?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do they give you some land that you can grow on, or are you not allowed to grow vegetables and so on?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How do they control that?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, this is something we can try to do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll reach out to her.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And how many people, so what she does is she does a workshop and she helps teach and explain to people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How many people do you think would attend a workshop where you are?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** According to mobilization, we can get more than 100 people, unless when I'm the one who have tried to minimize them.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But there are more than 100 people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** who have already expressed an interest in doing something with your new.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sight.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** More than 100 people have already said they are interested in your new project, your permaculture plan.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They are interested.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, MUTASA, I have your email.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm going to write a note to Anseema.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** me make sure I have your email.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have the MUTASA Foundation for Future Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I want to make sure I have your email.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's also Edward, who is very much closer, who could also come.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Give some advice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, let's write to both of them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is progress and this is problems, right?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It turns out we inspire people to try to do things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You've now got some land.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Now we have to make some connections so that some of the people who've done it before can help you get started.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is a good problem to have.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We were saying at the beginning of this call that we're not doing very well with money, but we are doing better, I think, with connections.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So let us see what we can do there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** MUTASA, I'm not sure I have your email address.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you put it in the chat?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My email address, let me put it there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Got it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right, son.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ananda, do you want to send this email or should I?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have an email for Grolon?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Who is Grolon?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, Anseema Roland.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, yes, yes, I do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It is Grolon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Anseema.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I'm going to share it with everyone here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I think, Ananda, you or I should just try to convey the opportunity.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** right.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me just note these emails.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I share an idea in the chat, and I would like to organize that activity on the Environment Day on June.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know if, how do you see, and what can we do to organize that day on 5 June?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good question.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we should certainly mobilise many people.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** World Environment State.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Have you posted this in the ERA Africa group, Lance?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It is only the idea which I come, Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Come again?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No, I say it is a good idea.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's a good program.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We should let everyone know about it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would like to do it and take many young youth for that day for the mobilisation of our activities.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, June 5th is not that far away.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We need to print, like, KPI.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You want to print flyers?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, flyers, banner, and maybe the big problem will be the car, the car which will help us to carry all the wastes, which will move on the lake, in the lake.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe it will be a big challenge because we must have some money to pay the car, and maybe the transport for those youth who will be with us.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, let's go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let's Let's go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let's go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's the kind of activity we really have to figure out how to support.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How much do you think the car and the flyers would cost?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or is there someone we know who can...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda, do you have an idea about the T-shirt we printed?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can ask it to Mr.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Edwards, because he knows me, I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, you should talk to Edward, especially because he's in that area.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He probably has resources that he could help you with.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So this is a local...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that can be a good activity for EcoRestoration.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I agree.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So we have two activities that we're trying to advance.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, there are two activities we're trying to advance right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The permaculture workshop and this event on Lake Victoria, they are both near Edwards Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think there are two separate events, though, because your permaculture workshop wants to be at your location of MUTASA.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do we know exactly where your where this acre is located?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you have a.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A map you can show us?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Malaba is near the Kenya border.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Mr.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This land is located in Eastern Uganda, Toro District, Malaba Townicenter.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But if people were going to show up, they'd want to go to a specific location, not just the district, maybe not even just the town, I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, it needs a share location, because when they reach Malaba, let me say they move on contacts, because it is in Malaba dialect, in Malaba Townicenter, because Malaba is not big, or it's not large at all.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's just a small town, whereby we...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They can move where we communicate, they find me waiting for them on the way, we go direct to the land.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I'm looking at Malaba on Google Maps, on Google Earth right now.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There's a produce market, I see, there's a customs and immigration office.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Where exactly?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Amagoro.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Amagoro.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Amagoro B.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In Amagoro, is that, I have an Amagoro in Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, Amagoro B.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I got it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I got it.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so your location is, here, I'll share my screen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So this is Amaguro B right here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if you can see this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And are you saying that this is your new launch?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Terrific.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Congratulations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Zooming out a little bit.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And is this the full, is this the full one and a half acres?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I didn't understand that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** MUTASA, is this your full area here, the one and a half acres?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's just within that area, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Within that area.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Terrific.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And it looks, I'm looking at it now, and, you know, usually I'm used to seeing a lot of bare ground like this, but it looks like currently you have grass on the ground.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is that true?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's true.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That suggests that the soil is not in bad shape.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is water available there?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it is available.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, I will share this.

**{'display_name': 'Climbien', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let's just, how do I do this?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Here's the link to Google Earth that will point right there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Climbien, you've got a good connection.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to see your face.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Amina, Amina.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, another issue, besides agriculture, I started a project of four hands, one  can change your life.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What can change your life?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Four hands, one .

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Four hands, one  can change your life.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I started this project according to the community I'm in, whereby I phoned people when someone is lacking, like, let me say 500 shillings Ugandan money.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I told them, instead of lacking 500 shillings, and yet we can change our life through rearing these four hands and  in a period of a year, four hands can give you 40 hands.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That means by the end of the year, you will be with 45 hands.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** By the moment moves for something like two to three years, when you can't lack 100,000 1M in your house.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, so far I've given...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But they are making it very good, they are taking care of them, and some of the hens have started laying eggs.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so that's the project, my second project I have, beside this one of schools, and beside agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I think that hens are part of agriculture, because when you have the birds, then you have compost, and then you can grow things with the compost.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They are very complementary, those two things together.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly, because even I told them, this manual of hens, we can use it, not growing it anyhow, but we make sure that we gather it in the same container, in one container, in a month we carry, we take in our garden.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** .

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** When we are not buying fertilizers, but we can make our own fertilizer through this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Excellent.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have been wondering whether microloans are available.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If someone wants a hen, I imagine, well, are the heads available or do they have to buy them?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I'm the one who looks for some money and I offer them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are you familiar with the concept of microloans?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In many parts of the world, it is possible to loan $5 or $10, to borrow $5 or $10, and you then pay it back.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe .

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Fifty cents a month.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But the point is, it's a way of helping people go from handouts to loans and develop their own businesses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And it's also potentially a way in which even if we if we only have a small amount of money, we can benefit multiple people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is there a micro loan program available to you?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, when that chance comes, we can use it so that we can change their lives.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it can work.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you is there someone who offers those loans in your area?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, right now they are not there.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Besides these ones, there is the loans which are there where by Uganda you pick money, but they need to take a percent.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They take 20 percent.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have percent 60 percent per it's 20 per...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What time period?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, a month, 30 days.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where by now for them, it's like, it's squeezed those people's life because 20% is very much money for those people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They can't afford it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I agree.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Could they afford, let's say, 10%?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, 10% they can afford.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And do you think they would be able to pay it back reliably?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, they can do it, sir.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe one, maybe, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We need someone who knows that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Now on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Seema is interested in that also, and she has some entrepreneurial and business experience.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it's time to go back to Anseema and see if she can put something along these lines together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A combination of training with microloans might be something we could really support with a small amount of money, but potentially with real impact.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think that is the perfect idea, and it will help.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You see the relevance, Okani, in a refugee camp where you are?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, there are some organizations here that are offering that opportunity for microloan from the refugees.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They used to offer them, but Not, not as

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Many as usual, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And why is that?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the problem, so the biggest problem here in Kenya, another problem we are facing is the corruption.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there are critical issues we are facing here in Kenya for corruption.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So sometimes that opportunity can come, but they are not reached to the people who are in need for that opportunity.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So sometimes the people are given that chance, maybe you have connection, relationship with the officers who are engaging with that services or offering those loans.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you need to have somebody in the camp that has access to a bank account to manage that?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And who can be trusted and who doesn't need to be bribed.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We need that one.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The Emoja Foundation has that in Naka Valley.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is that right?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They're offering micro-lounge?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they're offering also, like, for the women's groups, like a savings account.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that when the women have their little businesses and they want to save up their money and they don't want their husbands to take it all, they can put it into an account and put money aside for their children's education or clothing or different things that they want to save up for.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is great.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nanda, I, you know, if we had lots of money, we would be spending it, but we don't.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I keep returning to this notion.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** then.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Adятا, then.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That the people we're talking to, the people on this call, with appropriate training and support, could become those trustable micro-loan end-training people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And that might be a program we could put together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We have a network of people who we believe we can trust.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They say they have troubles with corruption.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They are beginning to develop programs of this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I mean, like, for example, this program of MUTASAs.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Does it seem like a possibility to you?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I mean, if it's something that can generate some income for the people concerned, and then they'd be able to pay it back.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** it.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** it.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then that money could recirculate, and small amounts of money could go places where they could do have a lot of impact.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's the way I feel about it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** MUTASA, do you have access to a bank account?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Equity Bank.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Would you be interested in piloting a loan program?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I mean, you want to get some hands.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let's start there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Would you be interested in a loan, 10% interest?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe, let's say, could you do 1% a month, just to make it very simple?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So if we were to loan you $100...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** colors.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And you would then be able to pay it back at $10 a month, and you would start distributing hens and loaning it to other people also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Something along those lines.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm making this up.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But the point is, is there a way to develop this possibility?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, this will help, will help a lot of people.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It will help.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the projects will move on well by that interest.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's affordable.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Even my community people, they can't fail to run it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One percent isn't $10 a month, it's $1.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's exactly right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** $1 a month back.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or a $100 loan.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or, you know, maybe $100 is more than is needed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So the next question is, what would be your very first action, MUTASA?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Where would you put the hens?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How would this begin?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the hens, for them, I always give them to people, the rare name, to the community people.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But because with me, where I stay, I have only 10 of them as mine.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, then the rest because What

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They are the ones which are used to pay school fees of my children and whatever, so I know the future in them.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's why I injected that program into the community so that they can also get it well.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But now, if this chance comes and I can cooperate with them again so that, because I don't deal with only young children, but these are the mature people who can understand.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they know how to move on each and every thing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, MUTASA, I would like you to send us some pictures, some pictures of your home and your eggs and the children interacting with them and of other people who would be interested in getting a few hens of their own.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And let's see if we can make a story that we can begin to test this with.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, sir.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll make it tomorrow.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll make it tomorrow, and I'll do it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let's see what we can do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We can't yet promise anything, but I think there's a good idea in here, and if we start very small, we ought to be able to find out if it works.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And so I'd like you also to think about how we can make sure it works, and then we'll talk again next week, in two weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In two weeks would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But you can send the picture sooner, and we will write to Anseema sooner.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** She has some entrepreneurial and business training, and I think she could help with this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So give us you

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Give us the materials to work with, and we'll try to put a story together.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Tokagi and Leonce, if you think this is a pattern that you could develop where you are, let's, again, give us pictures and a few words that would help us develop a pilot program of this sort.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have another call coming up, and I'm getting really hungry because I haven't had lunch.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I have only one.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a final suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're here in Kampunga, we have challenges of...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And getting someone like an entrepreneur who can come and train the people so how they can achieve.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So how can we help us in that area?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's a good question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I am hoping Anseema, who has taken entrepreneurship classes and currently is doing permaculture training, will know how to develop this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So Ananda and I, in our copious free time, will try to take this a step forward and we will follow up.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I hear that you have a specific desire for entrepreneurial training as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, see.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leave the comments.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** In to permaculture training, microloans, and a little bit of business savvy, makes sense.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it makes sense, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think even if you conduct an online meeting, I think they can work.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, that's also a good idea.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, because travel is complicated.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It takes long, and it's quite expensive.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, the cost, the price of gas in Africa is higher than it is here.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the roads are bad and difficult, so it's expensive, and it takes a long time to move people around.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in Kaupenau, you have a good road.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have a good road.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good to know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in Kaupenau.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kaupenau.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've driven between Malaba and down in Naki Valley, and it's a very long drive, and it takes a long time, and gas is expensive.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you, everybody, for your ideas.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you for inviting me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hang on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry things are so difficult right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We would like to be helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're trying to figure it out.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, all right.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was in West Africa, if I remember.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, West Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you in Nigeria or Senegal?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I am currently in Burkina Faso, but I live in northern Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if I recall, you are in Rwanda, right?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you in Kigali?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's right.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can see so many attackers changing us.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can't kick them out.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon is here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, he is not.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Leonce.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is this the first time you've come to one of these meetings, Peter?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Second, the second time.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very new, still learning.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But you've been working in Africa for quite some time, right?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, longer than I would care to admit.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They've been time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** just파, right?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a long time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** very proud to

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey, Leonce, can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How is DLS?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good afternoon.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good morning, everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are in Uganda?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I'm here in Uganda, I'm not in DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm here in Jinja.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, wow.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How is Jinja?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I miss Jinja.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's Jinja, it's good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And how about you?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You are flipping there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I'm flipping Jinja with eco-restoration and water unit.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's crazy.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so we've got some more people here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good morning, Yolanda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good morning, Yolanda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good morning.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good afternoon, MUTASA and MUTASA are here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, MUTASA.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I'm doing well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe, I think maybe we can start.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda, were you here in the last meeting, please?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I was.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we, Togani and MUTASA were here also, and we were focusing a lot on their projects the last time.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It seems like we kind of focus on the people who show up.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, maybe we can start with a check-in question, just simple.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe let's say the first name, where you come from, and tell us about how is the weather there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and so I'm Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** First, I'm from Rwanda, Kidiari.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The weather is cool here, so it's running season.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, as you can even feel, I have some flu.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but I'm really glad.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe I can pass to Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Peter Gubbels.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I work with Groundswell International as their senior advisor for West Africa, very new to ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the...

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The...

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The weather here, I'm based, I'm right now on, I am on assignment in Burkina Faso and meeting with different partners concerning the integration of peace-building into existing land restoration work.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, but normally I'm based in northern Ghana and the weather here, it is still hot, I think 40 degrees Celsius, but starting to get a few rains at the beginning of the rainy season.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you pass to someone else or maybe, yeah, you would tell us more about the initiative.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll pass on to Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi there, this is Russ Speer in California and I am working with people in several countries in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's a wonderful place.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I love the people.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wish the people in the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** were as nice as those people.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, let's pass it on to Michael Polarski.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Skeeter.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Michael, I'm in Washington State, USA, and we just had our last frost of the season yesterday.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're now in the clear for growing.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're much more likely that we can put out our warm season crops now.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I am working on reviving my global earth repair convergence.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so maybe we can talk about that in a bit.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, of course, if Peterson and Ugo Dugo in Burkina Faso, it would be lovely to get a little report on what's happening there because Burkina Faso is, you know, is certain.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very much in the news, and it'd be interesting to get a report from the ground on how things are developing there.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'll pass it on to...

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How about passing it on to Kalombo, if he's there and can do so?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe Kalombo joined the lesson, he joined the lesson.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see his face there, but...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's just arrived.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, how about Takani, or however that's pronounced, Takani, Muttakani.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, hello again, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I'm Takani.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a refugee in Kakuma refugee camp.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, we thank you, God, because we have...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nowadays, we are receiving rain.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this kakuma, to get rent is like a miracle, because we are in the same desert area, so the part where the camp is settled, it is somehow desert, and sometimes to receive rent is something which is critical, but nowadays we are receiving rent, so we thank God for that, so we are investing rent for irrigation, so that is the goodness, of the rent we are receiving.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, MUTASA.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can we be MUTASA Brian?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, hello, greetings to everyone.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** TASA Brian, as brothers said, I really take this opportunity to welcome you all from today's work.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Director of Mtasa Foundation for Future Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, as I explained before, greetings to Ananda and everyone.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me drive to...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonce is down in the area.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What else?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you introduce yourself?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My greetings to everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Leonce Boulonze.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm from GRC, but now I'm here in Jinja, Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm here as a refugee with my family, but also our...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm for Wara Unity Network and a member of Eco Restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very happy to meet you now and to share some exchange, Niall.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Perhaps we can pass it on to Bilizi Kalombo if he is available to unmute.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, hello everyone.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you again for the opportunity.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll be out of camera because I'm in darkness.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I want to be very visible.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's me.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This Kalombo is my name.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm from Nakivale, the refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the co-founder and executive director of African Youth Integrated for Socioeconomic Development.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm abbreviated as the IIST.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I work hand-in-hand with the...

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Diana Doheny, and we're implementing a regenerative ecosystem development program, which basically involves waste management, turning the waste into biochar and compost, and then distribute them to farmers.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're also doing part of stormwater management to protect Lake Nakee Valley, which is our main source of water within the settlement.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but also we're also working on other programs with Ananda and Jon to bring in more support to the refugees, especially microloans and also empowering community with the seeds, with some animals.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so we're doing this one with Roland and Sima, who is not on this call, so I'm just talking on her behalf on this.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very glad to be here, and it's my pleasure to be a member of ARA.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, Ananda, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Please come.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I'm Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the Vice President of the Eco Restoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Eastern Canada and here it is, cool and wet today.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, thanks everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that was really nice and has been a long time without hearing from you guys.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think today the thing that I landed on the agenda, like mainly what I wanted us to discuss about, I think mainly was about the synergies or collaborations among ourselves, especially LR members in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I would love to hear like your ideas on how we can collaborate if we do what we want to do because we do have like a lot of

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** things, activities, like the thing we've done in the past with knowledge sharing and maybe how we can also support each other through programs or maybe bringing in resources.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I would love to hear what you think, especially first from Ananda, because I know you've been to the AILA Steering Committee, but IAS also can give us ideas on what we can do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I also have some, but better that we talk about this if you feel comfortable.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** time Tokani and MUTASA were here and both of them were hoping for some some, some guys

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** guidance and funding and partly as a result of that conversation because we started the conversation with Roland and Seema and Bilizi about bringing some type of permaculture training combined with micro-loans.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's just the beginning of an idea, but it's starting to shape up a little bit more.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Obviously, it does involve fundraising on the part of ERA in order to get it going, but to combine the technical knowledge with some low

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the loans could also be in the form of things that are not money, such as seeds, such as trees, such as animals, but along with the skills to manage it properly so that a community can learn skills and begin to get a business going that makes them more self-sufficient.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in the long run.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I think that, you know, with all the funding cuts that everybody's experiencing these days, it's important to find ways that whatever money goes out there has the biggest impact possible and enables people to be more self-sufficient so that they don't have to keep on getting more and more money in order to keep on going.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're come Kelly.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yeah great so yeah i do really appreciate that and i think it's very very critical to focus on skills and knowledge sharing among ourselves so i don't know what the other things like peter michael and others um well i'd like to just uh maybe maybe we could talk for a minute on the permaculture training aspect now i know that when i'm on calls with africans that a very a pretty high percentage of people in africa that make it onto our zoom calls uh are trained or interested in permaculture or work with permaculture so it's very common and of course there are a few uh western people

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That, like Warren Brush, that travel in Africa and teach.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Warren, if you could ever get him, is just, I think, a very excellent permaculture teacher and has worked in Africa for a long time.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am curious of what the status of the permaculture network is in Africa at this time.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not really aware.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can anybody here give us, give me a, an update on the status of the permaculture networking community in Africa?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Make a stab at it?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can make a stab at it.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are various, I can't speak for Africa, there's 54 countries, you know, the United States.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** India and China can all fit into Africa if you include the Sahara.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I am familiar with different people.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the best run and successful permaculture groups is run by Stacia Nordini in Malawi and they do training.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Their website I think is called Never Ending Food.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I've been in contact with Stacia even though I'm here in West Africa, here in Malawi.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But she has published a lot and a lot of training and I know people who have gone through her training in permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So she's a very strong permaculture supporter and trainer and advocate.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think there's a permaculture group here in Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I'm not in Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in Ghana as well, but I'm not that familiar with them.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, there is a need, I think, to discuss a bit what we mean by permaculture because there is permaculture as it's practiced, you know, you do your master's class and you need to, you know, all of that in the United States.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I almost enrolled in that one time, but what the difference is between permaculture and its techniques and practices compared to, you know, work that's promoted by IFOAM, the different organic agricultural groups, and then those of us, like myself, that are involved in agroecology.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a lot of overlap between the principles, but permaculture is within the broader family, you know, if you want to, I call

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A group of families that all have similar principles.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't, you know, my own view, I'm not sure what others think, Michael, that we shouldn't be too, you know, we need to work together rather than be operating in our different silos.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And permaculture is great, but it's, you know, it's all part of a transition towards away from industrialization.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** farming and food systems, in my view, and more towards working with nature rather than against nature.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then different groups have different principles and ways of working.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's fine.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, you know, I know all about permaculture, I don't know all about it, but I mean, design and so many things that are not necessarily present in, in other forms of agroecology.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But my view, teaching

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can say so is that there isn't a movement that I've come across in permaculture that is African, Pan-African.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know of different groups, smaller groups that are doing localized and good work in different countries in different ways that is within what is called permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is the best I can give you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope that's been reasonably coherent and I'll stay there unless anyone has other questions.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I can send you that information from Stacey and Mardine and her group, if you wish.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be great, I suppose.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's always good to have more connections.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so, in other words, I see that Mimbilizi has his hand up.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So why don't, why doesn't he go?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I just wanted to add something about the permaculture group that our network that we have around.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I remember Aras had connected me to Widenrush and we're supposed to meet in northern Uganda in March, if I'm not mistaken, if not February, but because they are having some funding from USAID, so we couldn't meet because USAID had cut the donation and because they're supposed to give me the scholarship, they had to attend the training for a week.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But again, because of that, that one failed.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But currently it's in Uganda, though there are no scholarship opportunities, but we had planned to go and meet the Minister for Refugees in Uganda and also the Commission for Refugees and other international non-profits that are working within Uganda so that the permaculture training and the stuff that's doing in northern Uganda would be extended.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Another refugee settlement in Uganda because he told me he has a very big cost of land that was given to him by the Minister of Refugees.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So he wanted this network to continue so that we could meet and go for that bilateral meeting with these different stakeholders, like the ministers, the different NGOs, the governments, the UNHCR.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But because of that, so couldn't make it, but we're still looking for opportunities so that we can go.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I first, I first visit him, I learn what he's doing, I go through the training, and then we can move together in Kampala so that we can at least expand this network and then have such similar programs in different refugee settlements.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this is the plan that we're having with Ryan Bush, but yeah, that's the shot that we're still having now because of the USAID.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's sad to hear about that, you know, the USAID cuts affecting that, for instance.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, and um, and

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I believe that food aid in the world is being cut fairly severely as a worldwide phenomenon.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And certainly in the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** they just announced that they're cutting food aid to poor people that need help by 30% here, for instance.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So cutbacks are in this country as well.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe I'll do a little research then and see if I can prepare something useful for the group.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I would certainly like to say, though, that as a long-term member of permaculture since 1981, I've worked with a lot of permaculture people, mostly here, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** course, but just because a person's taking...

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** a permaculture design course or uses the word doesn't mean that they're really good some of some people of course are good but there's there's a lot of people that don't understand as as well as they might and of course there are people in agroecology that are are excellent you know so in every discipline or every type of agriculture there are people that are excellent and then there are people that are mediocre and there's people that are poor.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** so we always have to not just go by a name but but really look closely so I like to certainly point that out so I yes I I think that's enough if there's any other comments on this otherwise maybe switch a different agenda here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No I would just echo that I think the thing that comes from permaculture which is particularly really important.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** important and relevant is the whole aspect of water, which is not included in agroecology or regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's really the water harvesting aspect that is critical.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, I think that's really vital, especially with the issues faced in Africa, the scarcity and the irregularity of rainfalls, that it's particularly critical to understand how we can stock the water when it comes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, hear, And a lot of people, there's a lot of people that have the knowledge that, you know, it's just, it doesn't have to be permaculture training or permaculture per se, but it's really sharing the knowledge and getting it where it needs to be.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, maybe with the cuts to aid, I'm finding that, you know, know, so many people

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** People are stymied by not being able to get funding and I think that we need to get more creative about how we how we share knowledge.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, I just think that I've been I've been reading Will Ruddock's book on grassroots economy, which I find extremely interesting because it's, you know, can we can we share the resources that we have?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can we share the resources that we have and and not be so dependent on, you know, waiting for funding to come?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, like what can can we do step by step together with all the knowledge and resources that we do have?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, how can how can we we practices need use?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** buah,

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How can we facilitate the share of resources and information without always waiting for an agency to give chunks of money before we can begin?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A follow-up question for Peter on that order.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now that you're there in Burkina Faso, has the new government been able to, or getting more funding for projects like this?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Has it opened up?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** things improved as a result?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm curious because, of course, Western aid has been dropped.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One would assume that Ibrahim Tauri is actually making more money available for the grassroots.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do you find there?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ibrahim a very complex situation in Burkina Faso.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are two million people that are internally displaced.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are whole regions of the country which are no longer accessible or safe.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's ongoing conflict by jihadist elements that have increased dramatically over the last three or four years.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are stories of the government's approach of Ibrahim Taurari.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's very popular.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's seen to be like a reincarnation of Thomas Sankara.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you've heard of him, a previous leader of Burkina Faso.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He has a rhetoric of sovereignty and independence and autonomy and making use of local resources.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But so far he has given most of his attention to fighting or trying to crush the the

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jihadist elements, but it's more than just Jihadist.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, you know, it's a very complex situation.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I won't go into the detail.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's more than just Jihadist penetration.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's inter-ethnic conflict and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It gets all mixed into it.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As an ex-patriot here in Burkina, there are very few places I can go anymore outside of the capital.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's, that's not safe for me, where I used to work in almost all the regions and provinces in Burkina.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, in terms of the policies, Burkina has promulgated a national strategy for the promotion of agroecology, for the transition towards agroecology, which is, which many of...

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** us that are working in the movement that I'm involved in very pleased about to see a policy but because of the different challenges that the government is under you know bringing about the institutional changes that are needed for that is not yet in place or it's not yet you know a lot of work has to go towards the military work and a lot of work has to go towards humanitarian efforts the government the military government did try to do something to promote agriculture but unfortunately it was it wasn't a sort of in the in the way of agroecology or permaculture he bought tractors and sent them out to different places to try to encourage farmers to produce more which isn't in my view a the best you know

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think Captain Traore has the right sentiments about Burkina trying to become more self-sufficient and produce, you know, he has revived that saying, eat what you produce and produce what you eat, but is not yet fully, let's say himself, versed in the key principles of agroecology and what it takes.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and some of the reforms that need to be taken.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And a lot more is being done still by the NGOs.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm meeting with SPONG, which is the sort of the federation of all the NGOs tomorrow.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're going to talk about integrating peacebuilding into existing land restoration, evergreening, agroecology work, rather than having peacebuilding as a separate thread.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I would say, you know, that there's been less development aid coming into Burkina for reasons you've mentioned and has not been replaced by others.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the government has little, you know, insufficient resources given what they're spending on the military, yeah, what word should I use, program or efforts.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to invest in that.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know whether I've answered your question, Michael, it's very complex.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody's struggling to keep, everyone is struggling to keep, keep things going.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we are trying to devise ways of finding how to work with villages where they're no longer under our direct control.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, you know, we're trying to develop with cell phones, ways of keeping farmer leaders and We're trying commit 았어.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and women's groups active and they can leave their villages and we do training for them and then they go back but you know we can't collect people and have meetings anymore in some of those places because it's too so I hope I'm painting a picture that it's not you know it's not a very conducive atmosphere for the sort of grassroots work that we would normally like to do and we're struggling to cope with that uh so I'll leave it there unless there are other questions thank you that that does help um because reading news reports from many sources on the situation um it's good yeah some ground truthing as it were that's actually in there so I appreciate that um um

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'd be curious to hear a bit more, unless this is kind of a different track, about the efforts to include peacekeeping into the aid and agroecology work.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I can do that, Ananda, if you don't mind, if I keep talking.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is a, how should I put it?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have I have a deep motivation for doing this because I've worked in Burkina Faso for more than 10 years, I've lived here for 10 years, and since then I've continued to have partners and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's deeply distressing to see so much potential for the agroecological work, the water, the microwater catchment, the design, the moons, the agroforestry, the FMNR, the compost, all of that is going on.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** much.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, you know, it was starting to spread because Burkina normally doesn't spend a lot of money on, you know, the industrial approach.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And this is now being, what should I say, lost is not quite the right word, but, you know, we can't go forward because of the violence in many parts of the country and the insecurity.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, part of my work here that I'm doing is to try to do a scoping exercise to see what are the different peacekeeping initiatives going on in the country, what are their relative strengths, what successes have they had, and what are their weaknesses.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then what I'm going to do tomorrow with meeting with SPONG, you know, the association of all NGOs and foundations and so on in the country is convene the main sort of leaders of the peacebuilding groups and try to synthesize.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what is best practice?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What is working?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How does it differ in different places in the country?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And try to develop a model.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And one of the key weaknesses that is here is that peacebuilding specialists tend to work in isolation.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So peacebuilding is like a separate standalone type of work.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that is often not all that effective.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So needs.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So based on the work I've done before.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then on the other hand, you have all these ongoing, all this ongoing work done by a whole plethora of NGOs, local NGOs, cooperatives, women's groups that are doing more technical and income generation and agroecological work, land restoration work, very important, but they're more technically oriented.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they don't.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Don't have any specialty or experience or know how to go about, you know, identifying the causes of conflict and how to prevent it and how to engage the youth.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The youth are the main actors that get involved in violence and how to prevent that conflict from breaking out or managing it if it appears and how to keep youth out of, you know, from falling into the way of thinking of, you know, joining the jihadists so they can get money and get guns and whatever.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, the idea is to try to bring the peacekeeping specialists together with the rural development, agroecology, land restoration groups and try to train some of their staff because they have trust and reliance on the, and links with the communities and then have them develop sort of an added.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Dimension to the existing work because they already have outreach, you already meet, you know, like the one I work with that works in 128 villages and try to incorporate a peace building or a conflict resolution or not resolution but prevention aspect to the program and train people in that based on the best lessons that we hope to generate through this workshop that I'm trying to organize.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so that is the overall strategy.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I feel strongly about this.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I live in Northern Ghana and I think that it's just a question of time before this possibility of jihadist violence expands.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** know, it's already in Northern Benin, it's already in Northern Togo, it's already in Northern Ivory Coast.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's starting to spread into Senegal, you know, where it meets with Mali.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I just think

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We all need to learn more about how, you know, what are the factors that contribute to the possibility of violence and how can we prevent it and how can we give communities hope and a vision of how to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's what I'm trying to do.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Ananda, I really think that it works better if you can come on the one hand to organize women's savings and credit groups, and help them set up, you know, garden, dry season gardens and all that practical work.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's interesting for them and for men, the same thing with FMNR or agroforestry.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then you also have, you know, procedures and organization and leaders that you can then also talk about peacebuilding.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's very different than just going in and talking about peacebuilding by itself.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that is the country.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** about up feat an environment.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's back.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So underlying strategy that I'm trying to promote.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I've gone on a bit too long, perhaps, but I hope I've answered your question.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, that's very, that's very interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's interesting to hear that you're using a very grassroots approach.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think, like with people that we're working with more in East Africa, it isn't necessarily jihadists, but we have a very high number of people that are refugees.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** displaced by violence, other types of violence, but everybody, everybody's traumatized.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think the more people are hungry and stressed and have a hard time getting their basic needs met, the more likely they are to turn to violence and desperate means.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yes, people have a plan.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was here in the...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, nice discussions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if Louis has something to say, but what I get is that maybe we can start small, like having these kind of discussions around these topics that we mentioned, like permaculture, agroecology, and even trying to bring some other things, like Peter mentioned, practical expertise and experiences.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I was thinking of maybe having, like, starting with some webinars, as we did Ananda, you know, discussing on how we do things on the ground and, you know, sharing ideas with also local communities, because we really have some other people in our countries who are doing great work who can come and share their experiences, you know, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That sounds really good, Leo.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the really useful things in the past with development was farmer-to-farmer visits, oftentimes cross-country.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** People from Burkina Faso would go to Mali or other places, and they would visit model farmers or people that were doing really good work and share information, and that was really useful.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So today it's maybe not as easy.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe it wasn't very easy back then either, but having webinars, in a sense, is using the internet to do some of that farmer-to-farmer exchange.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So having some of the best people that you can find in Africa to do the training would be good.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, I mean, I can give a workshop.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter could do workshops.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, many of us here...

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have expertise to share, but if you can get the African voices to actually, that are experienced to share, that of course is even better.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I certainly support that idea.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe I will structure something and reach out to you all.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** for Inipus, but it's really nice and constructive having such kind of maybe farmer to farmer's online, you know, exchanges and yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, maybe having a project specifically for Africa to share skills and also see what people are doing on the ground, you know, come with a presentation and show us and show the world, you know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's also a good way.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But tell a story and So, today we

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and share the challenges that people are meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, Leonard, can I just make a quick, I would favor that.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Farmer to farmer and community to community is really essential for the work that we do because there are never enough government extension workers to get to every village and the best thing to do is start in a number of villages and then have the best of the farmer leaders be available as promoters and then take the best of those and go to the other villages.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is very much a part of a successful approach.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I should mention that farmer to farmer, we need to take into account the huge differences in context.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've never been to Rwanda, but I've been to Tanzania and Malawi and Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to Tanzania.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think that there's more of a community there and more commonality there.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But here, first of all, you have the language of French.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if you want to do something here, you know, it's very hard to find farmers or even NGO staff that could share, except maybe, you know, we need to take into account the language barrier.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I could help with the translation, but I just want to, but I think that, you we should try to have, I guess what I'm saying, more decentralized types of efforts.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, the Sahel is quite a different context than, even leaving aside the conflict, than East Africa and the Rift Valley and, you know, even Tanzania is a huge country, you know, compared from the North North, down to the South, down to Dar es Salaam.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's just a quick suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I like the idea, but we need to be.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thoughtful and strategic about how we would organize it and hopefully bring together people that could really learn with each other to have roughly similar context or situations or working in the same sort of agroecological zone like the Sahel would be one.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The drylands would be another.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The DRC would be more, well that's a big country as well, but forested area and so on.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we might want to think about that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, great input.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I really understand the importance of diversity, either in languages and other concepts.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a great idea and I noted that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any other person who want to jump in?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that if you had farmer to farmer, so to speak, or Africans teaching Africans, I um, think, think,

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think you might get more support and participation as well compared to what we're doing here which is good but you can see that we're you know few in numbers and and so and we could use more Africans in the conversation for sure here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay so when I did the we did the master class on cover crops we had quite a good attendance for that and people found it very interesting that I was wondering how to follow on I had following that sent around a spreadsheet which is probably not the way to do it to for people to fill in what types of cover crops they may be using or ground covers they may be using .

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been-muching.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And think So think I'm I

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I didn't get anybody filling anything in on that, so it probably wasn't the way to do it, but I guess I'm kind of feeling around for what would be the way to do that, to identify, you know, those people that are working with the ground covers and what are the kind of indigenous plants that are suitable in different environments and try to put together a resource on that.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, um, wasn't quite sure how to go about, uh, organizing that or identifying the people that have that knowledge.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wish I had more time, but I'd like to follow up on that with you, Ananda, a bit.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But one thing for Leo and for anybody in the group, what are some of the master classes or webinars or conversations, you know, that we would, uh, that would be useful, I'm sure there are many, but what are some of the, and then maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We pick a couple of the top ones and actually try to get something on board over the next couple of months, actually, because these are useful, this interchange, but when we're actually giving, passing on practical information, like the cover crops or like, in my case, medicinal forests or medicinal agroforestry systems, I know that Peter's really keen on agroforestry systems as well, but I haven't had much chance to, to relate there, but yeah, I'd be, I will put a little bit of time into this, maybe, maybe I will just say, Russ, how about getting Usman Pan to do something, I don't know, does he do many online trainings or whatever, because I bet Usman would be really good.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think he does any online trainings he might he might I'll I'll check with it and get back to you Skeeter they're they're putting they now have the two well they have the yeah Usman's in Senegal for people that don't know yeah Usman's this wonderful guy in Dakar he he was raised in a village in in Norway on the River Senegal and he has PhD in English his his village asked him to be the the mayor so he said okay you can you can elect me if you want but I'm going to put you to work so they elected him and he cleaned up the village got rid of all the plastic all the the trash looks like it it is a beautiful clean place now he took some old buildings and I'm trying to

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The Community Centers and started helping him with new farming techniques and such and the villages near him, near that village said, hey, we really like what you've done.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So he helped about 11 villages and then the Global Ecovillage Network discovered what he's doing and said, hey, we would like you to help us put together 50 ecovillages on the Senegalese side of the River Senegal and 50 on the Mauritanian side.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so he did.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he's planted or grown in nurseries.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'd say 100,000 plus, maybe closer to a million trees.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And some of you take sort of to the Mauritanian side in their canoes and they call them peace trees because they have kind of a history between Mauritania and Senegal.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** was

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sure caused by the colonizers some some kind of friction uh anyway wonderful guy in it and they have they have to have trainings that's what the hubs hubs is about and I'll check uh if you want to look at it look that's redis r e r e d e s I'll put it in the chat uh but it's it's wonderful what he's done they have a hundred villages they they just finished drilling or digging I should say they're 63rd well so almost all of the villages now have have uh some good wells and uh uh uh so it's it's very inspirational and and they're they're right on the uh the well they're in the sahel basically so they're trying to push back against the sierra sahara so uh michael i'll uh i'll i'll get back to you regarding Usman great uh

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** would be a good use of our last few minutes to just brainstorm a list of topics and potential resources to do seminars.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or maybe I can...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just a second.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Uganda, Warren Brush told me about this women's group.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's Uganda Rising.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're in Northern Senegal, excuse me, Northern Uganda, but they're expanding down into Southern Uganda, if I recall directly.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they do lots and lots and lots of training in permaculture and related subjects.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that would be my part of the brainstorming of the group to find out about.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll find them and I'll get it directly to you, Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was about to say, would you mind if maybe we can do a follow-up, like do a sheet, then we can see all the topics that we want to talk about and then think of potential speakers or farmers around the world, around Africa, and then we start moving things.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I was thinking on maybe having this webinar bi-weekly so that we cover so many people.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's my thought.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know what you think, but I think that would be nice to have enough time to bring together all these topics that we think about.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, and the group, Ananda, if you're brainstorming, I think in the Sahel that agroforestry is really and I think that's what I would call, a foundational practice, it's not sufficient to prevent degradation.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Soil and all of that, but it is an essential part of it, along with other innovations, but I would say that farm-imagined natural regeneration of trees is something that I still don't think is sufficiently widespread, even in Nisahel, much less to say other parts of Africa, and I would be ready to organize and co-facilitate a webinar on that topic.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I really think that agroforestry is essential for any type of long-term sustainable and resilience approach adaptation to climate change, especially in places where there is increased temperature, which people often are not familiar with, that the temperature is rising to the point that it crosses the threshold, the heat threshold of a lot of rain crops, and what are you going to do?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And dispersiate through agroforestry I think is one way to help farmers adapt.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there are many other benefits to trees on cropping land.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it needs more, you know, promotion and adaptation to different places.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'd be happy to do one on that topic if that is of interest for ecosystem restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Water harvesting and compost.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, I will send you all the email.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And thanks so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if there is any other issue or a question that we still have like two minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any final word?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that was a really nice conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much for the input.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, that sounds personal agroforestry systems, but maybe just even talking about producing medicines at the village level and farm level would be would be a useful I'm sure that would be useful I don't know it would be interesting to to convene people from different you know from maybe different parts of Africa but to discuss the situation in their places and what could be done to improve the situation I'd be happy to um collaborate on something along those lines yeah Mohengi Musinga probably has

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A lot of input on that.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I do have a project about medicinal plant and I think maybe I'll reach out to you, Michael.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I want to establish a medicinal garden using indigenous plants and in order to conserve some species because I've seen that in Rwanda we've been using so many indigenous medicinal plants and some of them are really extinct in the wild.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I know there's a lot of things that have been overharvested or loss of habitat.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have to check out for a couple of minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are we ending at in one minute here?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm afraid I will have to leave them.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right now, but I look forward to continuing the conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's really nice to see Peter here.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter and I were just at the Global Evergreening Alliances meeting the other day.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we cross a number of paths.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So lovely to see all of you and more next time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you all.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have a lovely day and morning, night.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREME', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye-bye.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye, Ananda, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels Groundswell-West Africa', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Take care.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you for everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I took Kenny.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I thought when I now looked at my ticket.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, I'm to arrive on the 8th, so I can't get a refund for my Airbnb, and it's going to be expensive to change the flight, so I have to, I have to eat it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and then the side event description that is in the program for the NICE event is not what I had written, so I don't know where the change happened, but it's not the talk I wrote, so I have to...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Rewrite.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...have to rewrite, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, anyway, things like that.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to get some brochures printed, but I can't print it until the description is correct or aligned, and that delay has cost me time.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, no...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, don't think I can get it printed here in New York in time, so I have to get it printed in Nice, so I have to find a printer in Nice from New York.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, those kinds of things.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, you've been quiet, and I know you are very busy.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been in preparation for this UN stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then also, we have this lovely book that I wrote, or helped write, I was the story editor on it, and it's a children's book, so this is coming out, which is exciting.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Nice or in Seville?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, this is being released on Amazon on June 21st, but it's to teach kids how to take care of the earth.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, yeah, and then we're hoping to build a game around it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's about four orphans that are...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, honey.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, sweetheart.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is Tissime's daughter.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You love your papa, don't you?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, you do.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can tell.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You love your papa.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You You love I'm a grande papa.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so it's kind of for children of all ages.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's written in rhyme.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a rhyming story, which is fun.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it brings in mathematics and herbalism and astronomy and quantum physics and music theory.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Brings in all sorts of really interesting elements.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's got nice illustrations.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I can get one for the cadence.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Might be.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, you could.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's fun.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But one of the characters is from Goma.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we wrote it before the troubles in Goma, but.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** for Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if we're in the right place.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leo said that, Leonard said that it was happening, so here I am.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm also, I thought I'm in the wrong place, but I've seen you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh-huh.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so I'm looking forward to get back my traveling shoes.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in Nice, you're going to attend which meeting?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** With Balkisa, yeah, for the Nice Ocean Conference.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm hoping to build momentum.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For the Seville event in Nice.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to connect them together.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's good.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I had a call yesterday with a woman that helps with financing, and she said that she wants to help us get in front of financiers, people that are giving money.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To our projects like ours.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was great, because we are struggling.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you see what I told you about the Hamlet?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The pictures?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The pictures at night.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was dramatic.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They look nice after the rains.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** look after rains.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** nice rains.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, everything's so green.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, well, I put a note in the chat saying that we're on the Zoom link.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon's note taker is here.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know where Leonard is.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He was trying to make sure everybody got here.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it the time?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we're at the right time.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He said meeting in five minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, we'll stay in a little bit longer.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I have to keep on going with my progress.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Trying to write the side event.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the most important thing for me in going to the United Nations is to recognize that, for me, watershed restoration is not included in their finance document that they will be ratifying in Seville.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Water is only mentioned twice, and watershed restoration is not mentioned at all.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that should be at the center of all the SDGs.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because if we don't have, if we continue to destroy our watersheds, it doesn't matter what else we do.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're not going to be able to solve the challenges we have if we don't put water at the center in everything, in all of our repair work.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have to consider that.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank You

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to build support around that idea, and we'll see.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you read about art blocks, about the untold story of how water and plants already cool our climate?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, say that again, I didn't hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is a story by Hatz.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hatz said that the untold story of how water and plants already cool our climate.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it could do much more if we let them.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's what I'm saying, is that if we could align with water, we have the greatest, most intelligent force on the planet.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We think we can, we think we can put tech to this.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We think we can create projects.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We think we can, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And all of that is, in fact.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Of course, if we don't get our relationship to water first, tech is not going to help us, because they're saying AI, but AI is using more water than anything.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, anyway, I don't know what to do here.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No one seems to be coming.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No one's answered my...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Something must have happened to Leonard Power, maybe, or something, because he's not coming out.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I get to talk to Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy about that.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's perfect.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's really...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've forwarded you what they wrote about water and plants.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** On what...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Fathom email?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Email.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that you can get some, you can pick some information there?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And LinkedIn seems to be really lighting up in terms of knowledge and watershed restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's, there's, Jon Schull is, is moving a lot of information and other people and that's, I think it's a good place to kind of catch the science and the, so I'm encouraging our, our Water Community Network members to get on to, get on to LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a lot, a lot of education that can happen there, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think when we meet, if I get the visa, I'm still struggling to get the visa.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, for Spain.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh-huh.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Balkisa said she was helping you with that.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I hope you can make it.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, my travel story is not bad.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** nice talking to you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think if I'm going to keep an eye on the WhatsApp and if people show up, then I'll come back on.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I need to keep going with stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have a good day.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Love to your family.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, I'm to arrive on the 8th, so I can't get a refund for my Airbnb, and it's going to be expensive to change the flight, so I have to, I have to eat it.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and then the side event description that is in the program for the NICE event is not what I had written, so I don't know where the change happened, but it's not the talk I wrote, so I have to...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Rewrite.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...have to rewrite, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, no...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, don't think I can get it printed here in New York in time, so I have to get it printed in Nice, so I have to find a printer in Nice from New York.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, those kinds of things.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, you've been quiet, and I know you are very busy.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been in preparation for this UN stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then also, we have this lovely book that I wrote, or helped write, I was the story editor on it, and it's a children's book, so this is coming out, which is exciting.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Nice or in Seville?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, this is being released on Amazon on June 21st, but it's to teach kids how to take care of the earth.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so it's kind of for children of all ages.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's written in rhyme.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a rhyming story, which is fun.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it brings in mathematics and herbalism and astronomy and quantum physics and music theory.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Brings in all sorts of really interesting elements.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's got nice illustrations.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I can get one for the cadence.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Might be.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, you could.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's fun.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But one of the characters is from Goma.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we wrote it before the troubles in Goma, but.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** for Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if we're in the right place.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leo said that, Leonard said that it was happening, so here I am.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm also, I thought I'm in the wrong place, but I've seen you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh-huh.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so I'm looking forward to get back my traveling shoes.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in Nice, you're going to attend which meeting?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** With Balkisa, yeah, for the Nice Ocean Conference.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm hoping to build momentum.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For the Seville event in Nice.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to connect them together.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's good.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I had a call yesterday with a woman that helps with financing, and she said that she wants to help us get in front of financiers, people that are giving money.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To our projects like ours.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was great, because we are struggling.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you see what I told you about the Hamlet?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The pictures?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The pictures at night.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was dramatic.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They look nice after the rains.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** look after rains.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** nice rains.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, everything's so green.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, well, I put a note in the chat saying that we're on the Zoom link.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon's note taker is here.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know where Leonard is.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He was trying to make sure everybody got here.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it the time?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we're at the right time.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He said meeting in five minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, we'll stay in a little bit longer.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I have to keep on going with my progress.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Trying to write the side event.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the most important thing for me in going to the United Nations is to recognize that, for me, watershed restoration is not included in their finance document that they will be ratifying in Seville.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Water is only mentioned twice, and watershed restoration is not mentioned at all.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that should be at the center of all the SDGs.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because if we don't have, if we continue to destroy our watersheds, it doesn't matter what else we do.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're not going to be able to solve the challenges we have if we don't put water at the center in everything, in all of our repair work.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have to consider that.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank You

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to build support around that idea, and we'll see.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you read about art blocks, about the untold story of how water and plants already cool our climate?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, say that again, I didn't hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is a story by Hatz.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hatz said that the untold story of how water and plants already cool our climate.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it could do much more if we let them.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's what I'm saying, is that if we could align with water, we have the greatest, most intelligent force on the planet.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We think we can, we think we can put tech to this.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We think we can create projects.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We think we can, right?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And all of that is, in fact.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Of course, if we don't get our relationship to water first, tech is not going to help us, because they're saying AI, but AI is using more water than anything.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, anyway, I don't know what to do here.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No one seems to be coming.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No one's answered my...

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Something must have happened to Leonard Power, maybe, or something, because he's not coming out.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I get to talk to Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy about that.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's perfect.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's really...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've forwarded you what they wrote about water and plants.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** On what...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Fathom email?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Email.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that you can get some, you can pick some information there?

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And LinkedIn seems to be really lighting up in terms of knowledge and watershed restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's, there's, Jon Schull is, is moving a lot of information and other people and that's, I think it's a good place to kind of catch the science and the, so I'm encouraging our, our Water Community Network members to get on to, get on to LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Eliza Herald', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a lot, a lot of education that can happen there, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think when we meet, if I get the visa, I'm still struggling to get the visa.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, for Spain.

## 💬 Transcript

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Today, if you allow me, we can have a down-off introduction.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been talking about my updates where I'm here in Kenya, so I don't know if maybe I think Greg did introduction, but maybe everyone who is here can introduce where you come from, where you are, and then, yeah, if you have like any updates that you want to give us in, maybe two minutes each, and then we will have discussions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a topic that I have it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'll pass to Greg, maybe?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I may hope you did this, but.

**{'display_name': 'Greg Jones', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, no, just four minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Greg Jones', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I represent an entity called Project Viome, involved in global rewilding, regeneration, reconnecting.

**{'display_name': 'Greg Jones', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No.

**{'display_name': 'Greg Jones', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon set up another kind of entity, but really looking to aggregate what exists, the focus beginning in Southern Africa, the lead entity here in Southern Africa is an entity called Swazi Foundation, which is the organic regenerative, born out of organic regenerative space, very much focused on agroecology, and so we have partnerships with like a global evergreening alliance, with the agroecology coalition, and then obviously, as I say, the focus, has been to try and find the support for the Southern African landscapes, and we have got projects that are ongoing at the moment, called the rewild Pumalunga, for example, a lot of alien vegetation clearing that needs to take place, which is the beginning point, but then obviously, you know, we're dealing with specifically the food security and climate resilience measures that need to be put into place, future.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm Jon Schull, I got back from the Pacific Northwest 24 hours ago, I'm in Rochester, New York, co-founder of the EcoRestoration Alliance, and very interested in seeing how we can knit all of these diverse groups into a fabric that will hold more than we can hold individually.

**{'display_name': 'Greg Jones', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mtokani, nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, nice to see you too.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Would you introduce yourself, please?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so I'm Pekani, I'm a refugee in Ikakuma refugee camp Kenya, so that's where I based.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Kenya, but Congolese by nationality.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what I'm doing here in Kakuma, we do permaculture, where we train young women, teen mothers, and youth in a permaculture field.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So apart from that also, we have another project which we have, basically will be launched on the 28th June, of kids, we do kid coding, where we gather young kids in a Kakuma refugee camp.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We will be training them after the school time.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we'll be engaging them in coding skill.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we have three topics which will be based on the introduction to computer.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Another one will be Scratch, how to design the simple game, Scratch game, and ATM ed, and how to create a basic simple website.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that are the...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** project which we are focused on doing in IKAKUMA, but mostly based on this palmaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mbilizi.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Leonard, for coordinating the session.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mbiliz Kalombo is my name, based in Nakiva Refugee Settlement, Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the Executive Director of African Youth Integrated for Socioeconomic Development.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Our work focuses on environmental protection and improving the livelihood of the refugees and the hosts in the Nakiva Refugee Settlement.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just an update.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a member of the Equal Association Alliance and the Coalition of Action for Swell Health.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Tomorrow, we are celebrating World Refugees Day, 20th of June.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I have an article that I want...

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Publish.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's already out.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, it is already written.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm waiting for the day.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is tomorrow to share it with everyone so that you can take a read on what is happening now about the refugee events in Uganda, what can be done, and the call to action.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, another update.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Today, we had a team of visitors from the European Union who came to assess the livelihood activities that are taking place across the settlements, and we are lucky that we are championing that on behalf of other refugee organizations in Akivale.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're just waiting for them to share the report of their findings, and then, once it's ready, I'll share it with the rest of the team.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you for listening.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jonathan.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you, Jonathan.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Jonathan Cloud.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm executive director of a small nonprofit called Possible Planet.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're mainly a fiscal sponsor for projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Colombia and elsewhere, and Jon mentioned that there were interesting things happening in Africa, so I thought I would join this call and learn more about them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, nice to have you here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the vice president of the EcoRestorational Alliance, and I've been working, supporting several projects, mostly in Uganda, a little bit in Kenya, and also searching for funds like many people are.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a big challenge to find funding for all the worthy projects that are going on.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Greg Jones', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's sad to see how many things are waiting to happen because there isn't enough funding being channeled to them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Elisaba, can you hear us?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Elisaba?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Elisaba, are you here?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe I think he's not here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So my quick updates that I have is that we are hosting an event that we have on 26th of June that we'll be talking about medicinal gardens establishment and how to establish.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Appreciate in agroforestry systems.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We'll be having amazing speakers like Michael and Mohanji.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think I will be posting and advertising it very soon.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I would like to request you a favor and in honor to share that to our Africa friends and members and everyone that you think that event will be interested for.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also to encourage other members to join.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know if anyone has any other updates, but I think today I'm really interested in the way we did our last meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we're going to have such kind of structure to have more discussions and engagement.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, but before I tell you what I want us

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to discuss on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I want to see if anyone has updates on anything that's related to our work or any opportunity that you want to share with us.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe Jon, Ruth, Blake.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I'd be interested in an update from Bilizi on his project, which is interesting and important.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Biliz, can you?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Go on.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a project that we are implementing together with Diana Dohin, who is also a member of Equal Restoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** called Regen.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's see if ecosystem development program, which is composed of waste management, organic waste, which should be having the belcher production and compost.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then in other phases, we should be having stormwater management to make sure that Lake Nike Valley is not contaminated.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also by putting up some formal waste management system in the settlement.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the project is still lagging behind because of a shortage of funding.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Our fundraising efforts have not been very promising.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have been redundant now for over two months because of the shortage of funding.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Diana has been playing her best, but optimal things have not yet unfolded.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are on pressure of the government because of the MOU that we have with them.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They want something to be done on the land.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are some threats that the land can be taken away or the MOU to be terminated.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've also gathered around over 200 tons now of the feedstock that's going to be converted into biochar.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's no means to transport them from different points up to the location because of logistics.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also, the land where it's positioned, it's not full of pasture.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know we're having some threads from the cattle keepers, but we're trying to manage them, but it's not easy on our side.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're still struggling, but I can say the project's really promising.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're having some pledges, but no one has committed to support Diana on the fundraising effort that she's still making.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I can say now that's what it's making us behind, and that's the struggle we are currently going through.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I believe I find myself wondering whether your project could go forward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Even if you don't have that facility that they have offered you, whether there is some place on the settlement, which would be less enclosed perhaps, but might be a way of building up your capacity without having the overhead and the burden that they have put on you.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, another place can be gotten, but which is not easy because for us to get a place, must be having, it should be formal, having the MOU with the government, maybe using other people's structure, which is sometimes you find they also have their own schedule, they have their own programs, which may not be, it may work, but may not be very easy.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Understood.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** would really like to, love to see your project get started and begin proving itself and uh,

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Generating some revenue.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** think you've got a lot of the pieces of the puzzle together, but we're all feeling your pain because it hasn't all come together yet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you for the update.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone else?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, if not, I think we, I think I'll move on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Today I have an interesting topic.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we're going to have like two breakout rooms because I want everyone to contribute.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We'll having 20 minutes to discuss on this topic.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's like three questions that I want to answer.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're going to try to imagine or featuring, featuring the

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Africa's landscapes, ecosystems.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where do you see Africa's ecosystem and landscapes in the future?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let's imagine maybe we are 50 years ahead now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where do you see our landscapes?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, I'll put the question in the chat now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, and after that, what are the current problems that you are facing in your landscape or in the work that you are doing?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is more personal.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And how are you tackling them?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Try to share like the strategies and or maybe adaptation measures or mitigation measures that you are taking to, you know, to tackle the problems that that you are meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if this one is understandable.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes, so then I will go ahead.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Please remember that we will be having maybe one representative from each loan so that the person will share what you guys discussed.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will assign people manually.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will try to be regional diverse.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One, three.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think you're all invited.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I haven't seen an invitation.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, are you going to assign you to the room, Jon?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't think so.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Brian.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, MUTASA.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, we are in the breakout room.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm going to assign you to the room one.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's used a lot of his money to help them transition from conventional agriculture over to regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what we're going to bring him into is very, very important for the island.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very, very important for the world as to its power generation and water harvesting out of the atmosphere, but in a very, very efficient way.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm hoping that once I get to know him and.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's a very good friend of a very good friend of mine, somebody I've known for 20 years.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm hoping that once he sees how this project is going to help the island of Ibiza, that I'll start a relationship with him and a lot of credibility and say, by the way, well, ideally, he'd give a bunch of money to ERA that could.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, we have so many well, you know, worthwhile projects that we know about, including yours, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we'll see.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's a multi-billionaire and he's already demonstrated that he's very concerned about how things are going with the environment.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, fingers crossed.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And a cent.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So why don'ts ERZABA and MUTASA introduce themselves?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we've heard from either of them at all today.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ERZABA, can you say something?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MUTASA, can you say something?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What country are you in, MUTASA?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Uganda, Malaba.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I didn't quite catch where you are.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you in Nakavali, or what part of Uganda are you in?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I beg your pardon?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Which part of Uganda are you in?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Eastern Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Eastern, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what, so do you, are you with an organization that's working on a project or trying to get a project started?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have, I started, I'm the founder of MUTASA Foundation for Future Uganda, whereby we basically look at...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Our street kids, bring them to go, we promote formal education, so that they go back to school.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** From there, a community member gave us a land whereby it's called MUTASA Permaculture Site.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This land, we use it to promote agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great, great, great.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, then, from there also, we have another project of Four Hands Can Change Your Life.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Four Hands, Wanokok, Can Change Your Life.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Basically, this one, we looked at how to change people's mindset.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not taking a hand like something small, but a hand can make you to be a person.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, child, we give you

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At school, we make sure that we give a package of four hands and one , so that in a period of four years, this person can be with access to pay her own tuition at school with some other small things.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wonderful.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, together we work with Water Unit Network to promote clean and safe water in the community.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry, you said you're working with the Water Unit Network?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great, great.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Elizabeth is a very, very good friend of mine, very old friend of mine, Elizabeth Harold.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Elijah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And she knows very well, because we were ever met in Jinja, this is also Eastern Uganda, with her.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where we started this program, but it's only that right now the challenges we are facing as with the organization is in financial, these are the challenges we face, whereby the projects are large, but financially, we are not stable.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yep, now like the site, the Mtasa Permaculture site, it's there, it needs a lot of support to see that we put it on a good standard whereby a child can come and learn more about agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But because of financial issues, we can't access most of plants, most of seedlings, we can't access them, just to financial issues.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, another thing, we are also planning

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We register the organization on the website, but still, those are some of the challenges we are facing right now, so that the foundation can be registered, so that the foundation can be registered to the website, to get a website.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also, we are challenged in that, due to financial issues, but with the case of working, we are committed, and we are doing as well as possible, to promote and to encourage young people in the community.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's what's needed more than anything.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I affirm the culture, the community involvement.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's too bad, I know that...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That it's hard.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, maybe, hopefully I'm wrong, but as far as being able to get volunteers to help you out, but you have a few, buy a few basic things, or do you have a plant nursery going or anything like that?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, right now, right now we started with the coffee plantations, because that's what I had access to.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh-huh.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so that's what I'm implementing in them right now, so that we can at least make it to see that we can promote our people.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...to get good citizens of the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just so I'm going to be walking pretty soon.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have to get to some place.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll have my phone.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll be there.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if someone else can plan to be the reporter for this, Colombo or Jonathan maybe, or you, MUTASA, just so you know, I won't be able to be the reporter when we get back to the main group.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Here's Ava, can you tell us something about you?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I saw you gave us a thumbs up a while back.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you're having some connectivity problems or something.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo, your voice has changed.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo, has

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I'm becoming old.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it was your daughter, actually.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's the daughter.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She was just talking next to me.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Does she have a report to give?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, sorry?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Does she have a report to give?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How old is she now?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** she doesn't.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How old she?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's now three years.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's old enough to give reports.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can't you say hi to everybody?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I mean.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Say hi.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unfortunately, you're unable to see her.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's dark here.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's hard to see her.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's dark, unfortunately.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep, yep.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** circa 530s.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So who is going to give reports on behalf of our group?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Will this be Jonathan or...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jonathan, are you there?

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I'm here, but I'm certainly not very knowledgeable about it.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As I mentioned in the main meeting, I'm a friend of Jon's.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** live in Rochester, New York, as does he.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he told me that there were some interesting things happening in the Africa work of the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I decided to join just to listen in.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I don't have anything, you know, any sense of what the kind of work that people are doing or, you know, anything.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm might friend all

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Useful.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So certainly people should, you know, report on their own actions and activities and projects.

**{'display_name': 'Jonathan Cloud, Possible Planet', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not in a position to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, we're going to be back.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're going to be back in the main meeting in about five minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I nominate MUTASA to give the report.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very, very simple.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just tell them what we talked about, which is mainly what, well, Colombo's, we have a report from Nakabali already, so you can just tell the whole group more about MUTASA.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How's that sound?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** try.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That'll be very good if you do that.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, I'll be walking and there might be traffic noise and such, so I don't want to be the one giving the...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's okay, it's okay.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, I think I'll request Elisa to get me your contact so that we shall talk more.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you should put your contact information into the chat and you can also say where you're from and a sentence or two about your group.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's some very good, you're familiar with the group in Uganda, it's mostly in northern Uganda, but they're expanding.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a group of women, I think it's called Uganda Rising.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They do a lot of work with Palabek Refugee Settlement.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there, there's an amazing permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A person named Warren Brush, and it has his base pretty much in Pallaback Refugee Settlement.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** has about 80,000 people there.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that place, I would imagine, is in really good shape as far as permaculture for the general population of the camp.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo, maybe you can tell us more about this.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** know you've had some one-on-one discussions with Warren.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yes.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've had some discussion with Warren Brush, and he's working with the African arising women in Pallaback Refugee Settlement, and they're doing a lot of work related to permaculture, water harvesting.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they have good relationship with the governments, including the Minister for the Refugees.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Currently, have been allocated over 100 hectares as a demonstration height, because they are also having some good partnership with the Danish Refugee Council, and they had some funding with the USAID, and they had plans of meeting one-on-one for a sponsorship to attend some of their trainings in Ipalabek.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But when there was the challenge with the USAID, so we were unable to make it happen.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but it's a very amazing group, and we hope very soon, maybe if things unfold, yeah, we shall be able to meet.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also in Uganda, there's a wonderful group called Edward...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hamlet, MUTASA, have you ever had any connection with them?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's largely a permaculture training center.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I believe they even have some facilities where people can come and learn and study and stay there.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, Kalombo can probably tell you more about it than I, but the, excuse me, the Edwards-Hamlet is part of the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you're connected to them already.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kalombo or Leonard, could you tell MUTASA more about Edwards-Hamlet?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I already connected with Edward-Hamlet, and I've ever reached there.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's where we met with Elisa.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We met there with Elisa, and we are together in touch with Elisa.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you want to move it?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, how many minutes do we have before we join the main group?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, it's time, but we can have like two more minutes to wrap up.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we're pretty much done here, if you want us to go back to the group.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, maybe let me visit the other group and see.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think MUTASA will be the reporter from our group.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Colombo, while we're waiting to join the main group, maybe you could tell people a little more about Edward's Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm correct, I believe, when I say it's large enough.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And established enough that they actually have people coming to learn and to, they probably have some interns that they bring there to train.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, unfortunately, me personally, I've never met or reached the Edwards Hamlets, but I just hear that they have a very good training center.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They also do some biochar, they grow coffee, they empower a lot of women, or they support a lot of women.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And currently, they are accepting some interns and they're doing experiential learning with Dr.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mara Huber.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think they have already established themselves and they're doing some great work.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I think MUTASA, who has been there, and Leonard, that have been there physically, yeah, they can have more to testify than I can do.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, thank you for the information.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm going to mute myself, and pretty soon I'm going to start walking, so I'll be listening, but I probably won't be able to participate very much.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Edward's Omelette, as you have mentioned, that is the way it is, you know.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, I don't even know what can say, but the way you have mentioned it.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everything, that's what is rare.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because it is a ...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How was it?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It has been good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Go.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Go.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You enjoyed.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, let us wait...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...to join us in 1 minute.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay, it's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** amazing oh wow i'm sorry if i cut you i'm sorry yeah but i hope you enjoyed the discussion it was really nice yeah let's hear from the first book what comes out well i'll tell you what um our group ended up talking about uh our shared vision and our shared need to find funding and we were comparing notes uh the agroecology fund and the agroecology coalition are now on my radar thanks to greg jones and susanna who you did cut off was about to share an insight and i'll i yield the floor to her so we can find out what it was yeah thank you yeah i've been uh over the years i've been in a conversation with tom bowerman who started the

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great Transition Initiative.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And his father was Bill Bowerman that created the Nike shoe.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Phil Knight is the Nike person in Eugene.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was thinking maybe if we had a letter that shows what all of you are doing and how it would connect Tom here and Eugene to the world, his think tank is also focused on climate as well as homelessness.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Eugene has the number one per capita homeless in the United States.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I thought maybe if there's something that shows our partnership and is a local project that becomes a model, perhaps they would eventually want to fund other projects as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's just an idea.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, you know, I'm in touch with Andrew Millison right now, who is based in either Eugene or Corvallis, but who is a great filmmaker and communicator about permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if he's in touch with that network, but we might try to put something together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Susanna, I'm going to put my email in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I can see that you're trying to get organized on this front, and we are too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I would really like to compare notes.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Andrew's great.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've met with him twice.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He teaches in Corvallis, and he's, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was a nice, nice discussion.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** By the way, I did a spreadsheet, I think I shared it with everyone, where we wish maybe to map donors and funders that we think are really potential for our work, especially in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if anyone has, you know, organization in mind, maybe you can feel free to fill in.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I shared the link in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we'll keep reading this maybe in the future after discussions that we will have, but I wanted to share it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just in case, MUTASA, I think you said you're going to represent the second group.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Here, in the group, we ended up discussing about MUTASA Pharmaculture site, whereby this is mostly or basically based in eastern Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is Toro District in Malaba Town Council.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we discussed also about MUTASA Foundation for Future Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This organization, it's led by me.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's led by me.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's all after looking after street kids.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** These children who lost hope in studies, we see that we make sure

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We take them back to school.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Those who can't afford this education, like these studies, we take them in vocations to learn some other things.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then from there, we do promote also a project of four hands, one  can change your life, to change our because mindset that a child who takes to school has to be given those hands in a period of four years.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** When he or she can afford some small, small needs.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then from there, we also discuss about Edward's homelette, whereby brother say that he has never reached there, but we know we shall learn more from there.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This came in after discussing about Mitasa Pharmaculture site, that we need to learn more about agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Put way up, bye.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right now in the bed we have coffee plantation in our nursery bed.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What we are mainly major, what we are majorly looking after is to promote agriculture in our area and changing mindset, people's mindset.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because this area we are in, most of the people, they don't think that agriculture can change your life.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For them, they think of daily income.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But for us, we need to change their life.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We need to change their mindset by promoting agriculture in them, or implementing agriculture in them, so that they can learn more.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So from there, also we discussed about, we discussed about giving out loans, like, because that program was in MUTASA Foundation for Future Uganda, to give out loans so that people can change their lives.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like these business people, when you get some little amount of money, you give that person so that he or she can begin and

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we ended up, when all of us, the challenge was all about finance, that all of us, have that financial issue whereby we have no way to be supported like these projects can go on well.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So those are the points we have been with today in our group.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's inspiring.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think you touched on the thing that we discussed mostly today, here I am in Kenya, attending GLAF.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like two things that we discussed mostly was touching on knowledge sharing and how we can use knowledge to change people's mindset.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the question was which strategy people should be using and how, you know, we can transfer this knowledge.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because we realized realized that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sometimes we bring knowledge that the community maybe doesn't need.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And sometimes we need to understand the needs of the community so that we share the knowledge that is based on the needs of the community.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it was really interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we keep learning on this.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But also the other thing was about the finance and funding and the challenge that I got from this.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the closing plenary was the words that spoken by ICRAF CEO, where she said that it's time for us Africans to depend on our resources, because she said that we have necessary resources that we need to bring change to our ecosystem restoration works and anything that we are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the challenge is how?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And right.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How these resources should be shared among the nations and the people who have, you know, capacity.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what you mentioned, I love the idea that you mentioned, sharing, you know, capacities and these resources through sharing chickens, you know, among the communities.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, we have the same thing in Rwanda where we share.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** People used to share cows, you know, the government established a system where they give cows to poor community, poor people, household.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then after this cow, when they give birth, then they have to share to the neighbors.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think these kind of systems, it's a game changer.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was really inspiring.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe I think in the future we can discuss more on how we can do these things.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** mean, collaborative work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I love collaboration.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And thank you, Jon, for opening my eyes, bringing a collaborative mindset.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's really powerful and very, very important for us, you know, especially Africans and people from out of Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We need to collaborate and, you know, share the power.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MUTASA, you want to talk about anything?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Please.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, like, the point you have pointed out of sharing ideas, and how can we change our community, or how can we support our community?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As me, MUTASA, what I thought first was to know what are the challenges of my people.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because you can't tell someone that you have found someone who is angry, you want to support that person, but you are telling him or her, go and plant his maize in a period of three to four months, you will eat.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's way above.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** above.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This period when the plants are still in the process of growing, how will this person survive?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, that point.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Here is where I came in, I told them, these people I'm with.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, I'm not financially stable, but let's share this small.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me take the child to school, because for me, I already go to school to request for the school to help me with some bursaries, like tushons.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then with MIMU TASA Foundation, we buy the items, like the small needs.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, this is where when the child is at school, I give you these hands.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In a period of four years, only in a period of one year, a hen gives out the rice, whereby, at least per hen, it will give you 30 chicks.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In a year.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In a period of four years, you'll be with 120 chicks from one hand.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This means 120 times four.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How many are those?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then that means even if I leave you there, you can change your life.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've already given you a step ahead.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And have you piloted or done that project already?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I started with that project.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So far, I've given out to five people.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** These are 20 hens I've given out and five .

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's fantastic.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At school, I'm already having 30 children.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 30 children, they're at school.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Can you, Andy, do you have a link that you can give us so that we can tell people about what you're doing?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it's just the right kind of thing.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I only have videos because, as you know, the way that I just started my thing, I'm not super in technology.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just get videos the way I did to you last time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I can just share those videos and the photos.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard, let's talk about creating a showcase for the kind of thing MUTASA is doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Susanna, you're on mute.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've been working on, with the African Council...

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everyone can create a profile and then have information.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we've been creating forums.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've been sharing ideas and creating collaborations.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so right now the site is not at the level that it will be, but we can certainly invite each one to create a profile so then people can reach out to each other and know about what everyone's doing.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then the fundraising team can find and group the projects that are in the same area if you're working on fundraising for women and farming or et cetera.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're working on that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you have a link that MUTASA and others can send their videos to?

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The way we do it is we would send them an invitation to create a profile.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I'm working with just who's the head of the African Council and then each head of each country so they can send it because otherwise it'll get stopped if it's on me.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We could just connect through WhatsApp or email and then connect them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, by the way, that's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I was thinking of maybe having a newsletter, a magazine, or a storybook showcasing all people and, you know, including their stories.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then that would be amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have the GCC World Newsletter that we just met about with Hilaire in DRC with the French and then Elvis in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're working on creating the newsletter.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And someone just joined us who's a cybersecurity great with emails.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we'll also have the GCC World News YouTube so people can upload videos that would be inspiring videos.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we can maybe partner on that.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just continue to create teams so that each one can work on what they're interested in working on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good to have you on board.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone who has a question or intervention?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I want to know what Russ is, what's going on with Russ?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He looks like he's in a cold place.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, I actually have a meeting with Indiana Jones.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I have another meeting I'm walking to, but he just flagged me over.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's actually a very good friend.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's a very big supporter of ocean pasture restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, excuse the interruption.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's all right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Goodbye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But great meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Susanna.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you don't know, she is one of the best organizers in the world.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Big, big network in Africa and Brazil and some other places.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we'll catch you all in two weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye-bye.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just a question about the schedule.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The 26th is next week.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We usually meet every two weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll try to leave.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll leave.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It'll just take a second.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the 26th is next week, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's next Thursday, so it's not our regular rhythm.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is the class going to be like an extra class outside of our every two weeks, or are we changing the rhythm?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, we wanted it to be an extra class.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We'll be having it...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Every two other weeks, but we took the other Thursday that we don't use.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so these classes are going to be extra.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're not part of our regular meetings.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** They are interleaved in the available slot.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, Susanna.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just wanted to mention, Ananda, your book that you wrote in French, you once connected with the school in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the people that was running the school is now in the U.S., and he has proposed an idea for people that don't have access to school to have computers.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I thought if we, at some point, partner with someone who's gathering phones and computers, maybe we could have your book as an e-book that would be available on this computer.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's just an idea for the future, but people have been, you know, continuing to do that outreach for figuring out how everyone can access some form of education.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And this is a conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's been going on.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I just wanted to mention that for the future.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have another book now, and they're both available as e-books.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, fantastic.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any other comments?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we are on time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MUTOKANI, seems like you have something in your mind.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For nothing which I have, I'm trying to generate ideas.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm learning, but before I have a pen, I'm taking some notes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll take down some notes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I have nothing to share at the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I did appreciate our conversation and the meeting for today.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** By the way, I'm still in Nailobi until 1st of July.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If we can meet anyway, but I know Kenya is so big, and again, I get a to meet Joshua, if you know him, you all, so he's here in Nairobi as well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Joshua, someone who is attending our meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He was in our meeting last time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you all.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't have any other business.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** See you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye, Goodbye, everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Susanna Meyer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard IYAMUREMYE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was nice to meet you, Susan.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How have you been?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been fine.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have you seen my email, the email that I sent to you?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not sure if you've seen it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've not seen it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been a behind in my emails.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** When did you send it?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Probably last week, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I might have missed it then.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, yeah, we are supposed to have our next...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For us, on 10th, and we were guessing that you can be among the speakers on agroforestry, because you, I don't know if you remember this.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's been a bit hectic for me.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been busy traveling, so I might have missed it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm sorry about that.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you can resend that to me, and then the 10th is still a ways away, and if you can let me know the time, then I can try to prepare something.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So do you mind doing that?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry, I've missed it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, it's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are we sending?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are we sending?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are we

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, hi, Marius, it's been a long time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Marius, can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, hi, Luce.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey, how you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great, great, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I like this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe before we start our meeting, I think maybe we can do some round of introduction and updates on what you are doing today, these days, and what you have been doing in a couple of weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I don't know if we can start with Peter, who has been traveling a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What's up?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Peter Gubbels.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm normally based in Ghana, northern Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My role is Senior Advisor for West Africa for Groundswell International, an organization that I helped co-found, co-create.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And our overall mission is to strengthen the capacity of rural communities to transform their farming and food systems from the ground up.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ok.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I've been involved in promoting agroforestry as a way to undertake land restoration with our network of partners in four countries across West Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I am retired now, and it took a bit of time.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My brother and niece came to Ghana for the first time.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was taking them around, and now I'm in Canada, where I spend about half the year.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's my background.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you want to pass to someone?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, Russ, over to you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, thank you, Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Russ Speer.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Oakland, California, and I'm a member of the ERA and the Environmental Climate.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have some...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** some...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** some...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have some...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have have some...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Projects I'm involved with in six different countries in Africa, including Ghana, and so it's nice to meet you all, and I can't really see who else is here on the screen, so Leonard, could you introduce somebody else, please?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe Mtokani.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, hi, so nice to meet you too, so I'm Tokani Saleh Amisi, so I'm Congolese, but currently I'm living in Kakuma refugee camp, it is a camp which is located in northern part of Kenya, so that's where I'm doing some project permaculture, so where we train youth and...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The basic training of agriculture and gives them some seed and support also the local farmer which we have within the Kavkuma to provide them with the seed that is the current food we are doing here in the Kavkuma Refugee Camp.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Jon Schull, co-founder of EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Once Ananda can introduce herself, then I want to circle back and I have a few questions for Peter and Takani.

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Ananda.

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the Vice President of the EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I work with regenerative agriculture and I am the author of two books, Hydrate the Earth and Restoring the Pillars of Life.

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All about...

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How restoring ecosystems can help mitigate climate change.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter, I'm trying to think through how Groundswell International supports.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, I've looked at your webpage and I've heard you present before, but it occurs to me I don't quite understand how or whether, for example, Groundswell International could support the activities that, Takani is doing in Kakumo or the ones we're trying to get organized in Nakavali.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have food shortages and a really impoverished agricultural and hydrological situation.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Seems relevant to Groundswell, and yet we haven't actually talked about connecting with them and seeing if we can support them in collaboration with Groundswell.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I am no longer part of Groundswell's staff.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And these sort of requests would either go to our executive director or to our regional coordinator.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what I can say is that we tend to concentrate on long-term partnerships with a network of partners, NGOs, and support them to develop, contribute to wider movements, contribute to advocacy.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And undertake work of their own to scale out and scale up their own activities in their respective countries.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we focus on Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we are a small network.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We don't want to become too, you know, a larger network is more complicated to manage.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we really look for partners.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That are, what should I say, compatible in terms of values, in terms of mission, in terms of orientation, in terms of their approach to working with communities, bottom up.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's not always easy to find those sorts of partners and also partners that are willing to document and share their experiences.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, our role is more one of cross-pollination, if I could use that term, an ecological term, between partners that are doing relatively the same thing in the same sort of larger eco-region, which would be the Sahel or the Guinea Savannah, and where there's a lot of overlap.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're not really structured to provide support for either in the humanitarian field, not at all.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** flownctos.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Puha.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unless it's a dire emergency, we did some things during COVID, but more in terms of capacity building for community-based type of work in the longer term.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, that's the framework in which I can answer.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, the countries you've mentioned, either the Congo or Kenya, we're not really, we don't have staff there and we just don't send money.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it has to be part of a, you know, a capacity to interact.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We bring, convene our different partners together, you know, to meet and to exchange around planned themes around, you know, what best lessons and land restoration, nutrition and water conservation, that type of thing.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, so we have those selected themes around which, you know, we have a collective learning experience.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll stop there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope I've answered your question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have, and it's fine.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It sounds to me like Groundswell International is the kind of organization we are gradually becoming to be, and we, really for reasons of just abstance, have converged on Uganda and its neighboring countries.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I wanted to get a sense of how you work and what you do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I do understand that a key part of your, of Groundswell's methodology is that your staff then go and work with the communities.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did I get that right?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, our staff, we only have minimal staff.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have three people and maybe a half.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You want to include me as a volunteer.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's our local partners, Jon, that do the work with communities, Yes, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we try to see what is it that you are doing well that works

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can try to support you to scale out, you know, to if you're working in 20 villages, how can we help you reach 60 villages, that type of thing.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then what is it that you are sort of lacking from a more holistic or systems-oriented approach?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sometimes it's gender, sometimes it's working with women's groups, sometimes it's nutrition.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, there are certain aspects, some are more strong in local marketing of tree, you know, non-forest tree products and that type of thing, and not so much into land restoration, you know.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we try to help diversify their program orientation as well.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So each partner can learn from the other, and we try to coordinate and support that in terms of a more holistic approach towards agroecology, food sovereignty, and land, and of course, that is based on land restoration in those places where they're working in degraded environments.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I asked the question as a fellow greybeard to see if, however, as a greybeard with more experience in the field and in these practices, you can help us figure out our ammo and what we do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I didn't mean to take the moderationship away from Leonard, so I'm going to hand it back and let him now regain control of his meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, no, it's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's very important, too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am a bit long-winded sometimes, but it depends on the type of question.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some can be answered yes or no.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Others require a bit more context.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, back to you, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe we can hear from Bilizi if you have any updates or for luncho.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's been a long time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, maybe Fala-Luncher, can you go first?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, good evening, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening, Arjun.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening, Leonel.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening, Liz.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice presentation I had from the speaker.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, it's been a busy time for me out here because there's a lot of work, field work.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So sometimes I miss the timing, and sometimes because of busy schedules, you can be on the feed and also be attending, won't show much concentration as expected.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I'm a guy of a learn shop, and I'm from Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm based in Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the ED of the Initiative for Climate Change and Neighborhood Energy Advocacy.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I saw what he spoke about, which is about land degradation, which is one of our traumatic area, and land forest restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also...

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Climate Change Advocacy.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So those are my thematic area and my focus points, which are we carry out our activities and being a part of this team has really helped me, you know, giving me a broad knowledge of how we can do these things differently and achieve greater results together.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you're welcome and I'd like to meet and work with everyone as I've always opened to.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think that is all for now.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I want to say Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I say hi.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you doing, Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey, Ruz.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bilizi, do you have any updates from your end?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, good evening, good morning, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bilizi Kalombo is my name, based in Nakee Valley, refugee settlement.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nothing big, but just to update you that there is an article that I wrote.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I shared it with the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I expected to get some more comments so that I can improve next time, because these days I want to inform the world about what is taking place.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, some people have already given some comments, but I'm just waiting to hear from the side of ERA, so that next time at least it can be better than how it is.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And currently, I can say it's somewhat positive, the refugee influx in Akiva is reducing, possibly because of the agreement that the government of USA signed with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the number of refugees that we are receiving is currently reducing compared to before.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, and currently we are doing an assessment to get the Office of the Prime Minister to see how many refugees are going back, how many are staying, who are coming to assess and to write a comprehensive report about, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly, because currently there are a lot of numbers of the returnees, like the refugees who are coming and then they go back to their home countries, but there's not any database or any data regarding how many are still around, so that's what they currently are doing, and I'm part of that team to do that, but I'm very hopeful that once the report is shared, I'll also be able to share it with the rest of the team.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so thank you, that's just a brief update from my side.

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Belize, can you share the project that you were raising money for, for the Combo biochar, what's happening with that?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I thought it's not the right platform to share what's really taking place, yeah, but there's a program that we launched here, I think since last year, with the, with the Diana Dohini, who is also a member of ERA.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you're...

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're facing some challenge because we're given land and we have some infrastructure, but because we have the memorandum of understanding with the government, they carried out the MOU mid-term review, and they found that what is on the system or what we're supposed to report by now is not really matching.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then, yeah, because there was joint monitoring, it was last week, it was on 26th and 27th last week, then we had the wrap-up meeting this Monday, so some projects have already been terminated, like the MOUs, some of them have been terminated, and some land have been grabbed already, but good enough, I had informed the Commissioner for Refugees at the High Office in Kampala, and also at the regional level, and the settlement commandant, knew what level we are going through.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** regarding funding, but we're just given the grace period of up to 15th of this month, so failure to abide or failure to do have anything implemented.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then our MO is also going to be terminated, and then they take everything that you have invested.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's why currently the head is so hot, very stressed.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But that's the reality, and that's what is taking place.

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The things that you have already bought, are they going to seize those?

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, whatever is on the land, they take everything.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because with the MO, what they do, so the land belongs to the government.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you're not using it.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if you're using it, you keep with the land for as many years as you can.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But as the commander said, there's nothing that you're doing because the population is big, and then some land is idle, and they have to give it to the organization or the partner that has maybe funding to develop it for the benefits of the community.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's the philosophy behind it.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** whenever there's that saga like you find, you are given a land, but you're not using it for the benefit of the community, they grab everything including infrastructure.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Raksha.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is on that land.

**{'display_name': "Jon's Fathom Notetaker and Recorder.", 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, did you hear that?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we are doing a round of introductions and updates on what we are doing and what we have been doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if you are hearing, you can go on and then we jump into the discussion of today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I have a specific topic.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I did so Well, sorry, sorry for joining Ledge.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wait, wait.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Go ahead, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry for joining Ledge.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was in another meeting with the GFCCA.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was with Dras and Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They left during this meeting earlier.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I stayed just to finish the other meeting.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** were from...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** were I

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is MOSES Ojunju.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been here for a very long time, since last year.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a project in Kenya, a non-profit organization, Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We work with smallholder farmers on regenerative farming.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so currently we have about 1,800 farmers because we've just recruited recently about 600 farmers in our community.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in our system, in our database.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so we are planting trees.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** we are planting a lot of local trees.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For creating local or native species in our system.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, we've been working with schools.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The schools are greening initiative to plant trees and also to take our climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So will

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is to young learners in schools that probably need this information at a younger stage, at an early stage, so that they can grow, you know, having all this information through their systems.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been here long enough, I've interacted with Leonard physically, he visited sometimes early this year in Hatch with Ananda, and I've also had some conversations with Russ, Dayo, we were joined in another class, I was with Folorunsho, Dayo, and I'm, you know, of course, willing to discuss this, and every other time, when I don't have a lot of activities, willing to join the meetings, and have a very productive call, as the African Council.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh great, thanks, thanks Folorunsho, thanks Moses, thanks Folorunsho, for just updating us that you're expecting to, to receive Diana.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you can tell us more in two minutes if you want.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not receiving Diana yet.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm receiving Diana's team member because we want to carry out a due diligence with the Kuku Farmers here in Taraba State.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's been a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been visiting the necessary association and those that really matter to make these three resources for us.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And fortunately, the deputy governor of Taraba State is the chairman of the Kuku Farmers Association.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's really going to help to give the organization a proper recognition of future reference and partnership.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it was when I met with the permanent secretary because the deputy governor was not on seat.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** With a team member and some other, we're told that they are really ready to partner and see how they can make whatever kind of work they want to do, success, and that they will see the way that the government can come in, which they say they are very open to support and any other team, but no.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we're just being careful not to give them the details, full details of what we want to do so that it will not be sabotaged or seeing our idea being copied or, you know, so we're just trying to make sure that we do our due diligence, get the necessary data, work with them, and see how to manage a very good relationship.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we all have a success and make Parabas State Cocoa Farmers, you know, to strive and come up because it's really been a very, the farmers, I had one or two interviews with them, and they're really complaining that the government have not been supporting, not been looking at their side, do everything on their own.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they need organizations like this to see how they can come up there, maybe the government will jump up and make things happen for them here.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is the latest that my new speaker should be expecting, a team member coming from Port-Arcourt, but not Diana herself.

**{'display_name': 'Folorunsho DAyo Oluwafemi', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's very important, you know, and I believe in collaboration and partnerships.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, I think my updates were that, oh, last time I was in Kenya, attending GLF Africa and Landscape Readership Camp, which is a big initiative that brings together African restoration stewards and actors.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Especially the camp holds more than 50 young people from across Africa, where they came and share stories, experience, and learn from each other and what they are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And at the end of it, we joined GLF Africa, which is a global forum, global restoration forum, where experts, so many people join at ICRAF, World Agroforestry, to discuss all these things we've been discussing, either finance, how Africa's, you know, economy should be basing on their natural resources, but also, it was amazing to see and to remind us that Africa is powerful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have powerful, we have resources, we have good environment, but still we have challenges on how to manage it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, I think from my end, I wrote a report, a short report, a recap, that a story that I wish to share to GLF about my experience and, yeah, everything that I got from that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you want, maybe I can share that with you for personal needs.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** yeah, that was my makeup.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if there is no question, we still have 30 minutes that we can use for discussion because last meeting, I don't know the date, but there is a meeting that we had discussions about the challenges that we have and what do you think ELA can do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And among the top, top challenges, we talked about financing and funding grants.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I know ELA is developing something around having committees, but I think this will be a good start for us, African members, to discuss on this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I brought some questions that we can read on in this discussion.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you allow me to share this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see we are 10 people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe we can use four or four people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I found this on the web for ten people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Check it out.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe we can help break out some more.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Four, four, five.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Four, five.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, let start discussing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me share the questions.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if I can share them in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But first, I want to break on those questions.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you can see my screen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you see my screen?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we have a few time, but we can try to discuss on these questions because seeing how we can do, resources, mobilization, the main objective of this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is to find innovative way on how we can secure funding on our ongoing and new projects that we have in our members.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So first question that we'll be discussing on will be, what are the effective funding sources do you think we can start thinking on?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Either government, international organization, or private sectors, or also how we can use our projects, again, to generate more incomes, because I realize that sometimes we need to use also the projects that we have to generate some income for the project's sustainability.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And how can we create a comparing proposal for our members, for Equal Estoration Alliance members, if we do think this is doable, how do you think we can do this?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Should we consider creating a revolving fund or joint funding activities or initiatives across our members, organization?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, this kind of brainstorming.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I was thinking maybe we can list the funders or funding organization or donors that we think are really interested in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some of them we know, like I may mention some, but I know you know more than me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I also have created the sheet.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you can use that, but maybe each group will have a note taker, person who can try to note these things, if it's organization, to note them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe I can share the link to this document for us to use.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, then I will send you to the groups if you don't have any questions.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any question, comment?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see no question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we try to, yeah, we try to use like 20 minutes, 20 minutes maximum.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we come back, yeah, after 20 minutes, then we share, each team will have representatives to share what they have.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then, so, try to assign people, just to kind of, in this, send them, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank You can write something that makes sense, and don't just concentrate on that one, it makes more sense, that was our perception.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because the money is recycled in this way.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can put a donor, ERA donor fund, and then get some grant money to seed into that, then as the people are able to pay back their loan, then it keeps expanding.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it does become more self-sustaining in the end.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The trick is to get the lump of money at the beginning.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But this project that Roland and Bilizi wrote, I mean, they only want $40,000 to get it started.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it will have a tremendous impact.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, it will impact hundreds of families, and then it can, if the money returns, or the, the, the chicken.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pigs and Goats return.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It can be reused.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda, missed Roland, and who else?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Who wrote the proposal with her?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Belize.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi there.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know him.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, they sat down together and they came up with a plan to do a micro-loan project.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there was different categories of loans.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sometimes it could be a financial loan of money to start some type of small business.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it can also be a loan of seeds or tree seedlings or goats or pigs.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Along with training in how to manage the money, how to manage a business.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...and...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...and...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The idea is that that money comes back.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So when the person is successful, then they return, either they return pigs or they return money or they return seeds or whatever they do.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's along with the along with the training to help them get some basic notions about how to manage money and how to how to actually grow the seeds or raise the pigs or whatever it is.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know that Roland took that course about four years ago on entrepreneurship, and I'm sure she's I know she she gives some great classes in a lot of different areas.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I just keep hearing everywhere I go that people are looking for the same things, you know.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I actually connected Roland with a good friend of mine in Germany, Eric Schneider.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kalombo knows him some.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She has the personality that got Eric really excited because he has heroes.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they'll actually, a very, very small percentage of people in the world have this kind of a personality that can get people real excited.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so hopefully you'll get some funding coming into Nakavali from some fundraisers in other countries.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And she would share that around Nakavali through her organization and this thing she just put together with Kalombo.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I just...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I had a note to have an update meeting with Roland and Eric and see how things are coming along with that.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Eric is doing it with schools?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For example, there's a village in Germany that does a fundraiser.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Every year they've done it for the last 10 years.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a marathon.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's 48 hours straight.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's the most exciting thing that happens in this village of about 20,000 people, I think it is, in Germany.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they just love it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** then the personalities that he hooked them up with, the people he hooked them up with in Nepal, they have frequent or, you know, as needed, they have video meetings, plus the kids.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm sure a couple of adults from supervision.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** supervision.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Go to Nepal every year.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They, you know, they pay their own expenses to do that, I'm sure, but they come up with 40,000 euros every year for the last 10 years.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They've built hospitals, they've built schools, they've really done amazing things for this village in Nepal.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the money goes to this village with no strings attached.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They don't have to even write down what they do with it and report back to the people who gave them the 40,000 because those people visit the village.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, they know what's going on and they see how important it is.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm hoping, and Eric is working on getting some fundraisers going for Roland, which is getting fundraisers for Macavalli.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we get 40,000.,000.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Year coming in, Euros, they do so much with that at Sacavalli.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will, I'm looking at my notes here, I'll contact the two of them today and put together a three-person update.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know they have been talking periodically, just the two of them, which is great.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In fact, Ananda, the first time we met is for about two hours.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And for part of the meeting, I requested that they speak just in French.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Of course, I have no French at all, but it's lovely.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a lovely language.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have you noticed that, Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so it is so fun.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Roland is super bright.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's a refugee, she and her family, 13 of them.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She has a mom and a dad and three siblings, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But all in all, they brought 13 people from the DRC, and they all live in this one house.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, oh, but the thing is, I told her the first time I met her on a video call, said, you know, your English is really good.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And she said, and she kind of smiled, and she said, yeah, when she was eight years old, she decided that it'd be a good idea to learn English.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So she took a class, and then she just kept teaching herself.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So she's a real mover and shaker, as is Columbo, and Samuel, of course, but there's some electric chemistry going on when they met, because he recognized some heroes from his past, heroes and heroines.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Which, uh, you You

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's had a group of youth leaders for 20 plus years that all of them do fundraisers of some kind, but just a few of them are these, they have the whole package that he can put on display to connect with the right groups and get those groups excited.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we'll see what happens, but I have very, very strong hope for this and to get some money flowing into Nakavali sooner rather than later.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, once the success with some programs in Nakavali could also be expanded to other refugee camps if we get the model proven.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Columbo is still, of course, wanting.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very much to get Mary Carvajal's bios into there.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It turns out, just so you know, I was talking to Mary not that long ago, and Palabat could probably be the first place to start because it only has 80,000 people.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it'd be more manageable.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But once we get it going, I think we'll get some funding for many, many plants because it is going to make such profound differences for everybody at that, everybody anywhere.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as far as helping out with the health care and so many other things, as you know, for refugee settlements.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What was the name of the camp you mentioned that had less people?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Palabat, it's in northern Uganda, and it's, there's a training center there, an amazing training center that Colombo knows about.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's run by Warren Brown.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, so, right, and, and as, is, you know, once they cut back on USAID, they had to cut back on the programs at Polybeck, so that the scholarships that, uh, Colombo, Samuel, and, uh, Roland had to go there, uh, had to be withdrawn.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, it's so horrible what our government's doing to create chaos over the world with all the funds that have been pulled out.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, uh, absolutely criminal, as you two are well aware.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh, Mike, hello.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey, John.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh, Michael was just about to show us something, and now he's probably, I suppose,

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's to get pulled back into the space, right?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard might be able to answer that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I see.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I got pulled into room one.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wanted us to exchange.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe I can take you back there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Columbo, how much in funding would you need to make it so, well, you said you need it by the middle of this month, right?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We need it by the middle of this month.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How much would keep things in place for you?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently, we are looking for $15,000.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** $15,000.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You take this.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so that's out of the total of...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** let's Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Diana's church gave you $5,000 to get things started, right?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yes.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** need, because Diana, for the first year, $5,000, and we need the $20,000 in total to make sure everything starts.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so, and unfortunately, her church probably can't come up with that amount, right?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, she's still struggling, but as if she has failed.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, yeah, that's, money's so tight.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, as you know, I'm hoping, well, I am going to be meeting, I hope, within a month with this billionaire from Sweden.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, and he, bringing him into some actually money-making.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Projects, but he's very generous anyway, and once he finds out that there's some place where he can get some really big, big, big bangs for his philanthropic buck, like at Nakavali, just fingers crossed.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I believe you do know that Nakavali's always on the top of the list when I'm looking around, but it's tricky to get the funding, but I'd really like to have a breakthrough with this or another, you know, some other wealthy, wealthy people, person that can give a lump of a million or two million to ERA and start funding these great things that are sitting out there.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Waiting for the funding.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, funding is really a challenge, especially these days.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, now that most NGOs are closing up, main donors are no longer giving to the kiosk all over the world.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, funding is really becoming a problem.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Warren Brush, one of his old friends and strong partners there, has a great, solid, long-standing connection with the Crown Family Foundation, as you know.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as soon as USAID pulled out, the Crown family just had to put all their money into feeding people, which is understandable.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the timing was horrible.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we'd be getting bios into Polybeck by now.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Yeah, you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Trump hadn't done all his horrible, made all his horrible changes.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, he'll keep working at it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a lot of the right kind of people that have money that just need to find out that these are some really legitimate programs like yours.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And people can benefit so much.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, so keep plugging away.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are actually lots of positive things going on.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I told you about the company Ocean Pasture Restoration that can really start to cool off the planet.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's coming along very, very well as far as I think we're going to get some funding for it pretty soon.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey, Skeeter, how are you?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm pretty good.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** was just in the room.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My connection broke down, so they just sent me over here, so I get to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, Leonard's been shifting people around pretty systematically, really, to let everybody have a little small group time.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ah, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, uh, so Michael, or Skeeter, I was just, uh, telling Columbo that the Ocean Pasture Estoration were, I think we're going to get some funding pretty soon, um, and start cooling off the planet.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, you know Dennis Garrity, I would imagine, with, uh, Evergreening Alliance, but also with the Health and Planet Action Coalition.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's very excited.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I talked to him for about 90, well, for example,

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, 96 minutes, about a week ago, and then I set up a meeting with him and Russ George.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That lasted 96 minutes, and it was like we handed Dennis the Holy Grail.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's very excited because, were you at the meeting?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I came because it says something about cooling.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know Dennis a little bit through Rob DeLapp, but I always thought of him as mostly a tree guy.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But then I found out about the Healthy Planet Action Coalition.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's actually going to be meeting, he and one of the members from India.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Dennis will be in India this coming month, meeting with Modi and presenting various ideas to help out India, which, of course, what about the world, kind of EcoRestoration anywhere.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** uh

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they really have a lot of things set to go, and they were ready to do some kind of a Hail Mary.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They didn't really have anything they were that excited about that they thought could do that much, but now they have something they're really excited about.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're meeting again this coming Saturday, our time will be Sunday, 7 a.m.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** in the Philippines, where Dennis is, Dennis and his wife.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, some very positive action there, and I'll keep you in the loop.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Leo.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Alicia, I think you're there.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, Emily.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Michael.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Busy.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A little bit.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's hard to keep up.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can't.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** can't.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's impossible.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think actually we were discussing about fundraising and I know it's all about money.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it seems like you are going to close our breakout looms in a second and then we go back to my loom.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Colombo, how's your financing lately?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have, you used up all your money or is more still coming?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are still, we are having a challenge with the financing and the projects are under risk.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very soon they are going to shut down because of failure to comply with the recommendations and the requirements of the office of the prime minister.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so that's the situation we are in now.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so far, whatever we have invested in, they are likely to take everything.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's the stress that we are currently fighting with.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, that's bad news there.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's the sometimes the reporting and all the things you have to do, they need to be funded as well.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's hard to do.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't do that very well myself.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I've always had the idea.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, hi.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I cast you off, but sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, that's all right.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, but time to go.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Time to come back.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** See who else is here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I mixed you all up.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe you can share some learnings from the groups.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see the time is maybe two minutes each.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll go for two.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's, we've been talking about this, this strange and difficult moment when there's no funding, and there's greater need.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we have a particular proposal that Ananda has been developing that involves Anzima and Colombo, that says, you know, this notion of training and microloans is a way of building self-reliance without with a very small amount of money.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I think we're really going to try to pitch, develop a pitch for that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think Ananda and Peter Adama, who was at the last meeting and a colleague of Diana Doheny's named John Adobo, I think are going to try to prioritize that in the next week.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's my two-minute summary of what I got.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone from group two?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, no, one.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a little hard to tell which group we were in because we got switched in the middle, so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, Belize was not in with me for the breakout period, so anything he has to say will be news.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was with every other person apart from Jon and Peter.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in the group that I was with Enanda, we were also discussing about the same program that we were having with Ansima Roland, so I don't have to repeat that.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but again, of latest, we were in the same meeting with Michael, and we were looking at maybe identifying some small projects.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** at same

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that can be easily funded, instead of looking at the bigger projects, which getting their financing is hard, because currently there's a crisis of finance, yeah, we can see across the globe, but looking at small projects and finding small donors who can support that would be an ideal.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then also, I was in another group with Russ for some few minutes, and he was pointing out some key families and wealth individuals who could potentially meet and talk to them, so that they can bring in money to ERA, so that ERA can also be in position to keep funding some projects of their own members.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's what I can summarize.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was very good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Both points are ones I'm pleased to hear.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Who has the list of those wealthy families that Russ is talking about?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are we supposed to, what's the plan for connecting with them?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I'm going to be talking to a couple of them, hopefully within...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A week or so.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As soon as I get off here, I'm going to do some emails to Sally Calhoun and a few others.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Cool.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, I now know Sally fairly.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great, Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Please do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know Sally fairly well right now because I've been hanging out with her at this threshold meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But that's just FYI.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think you should indeed see who you can interest in this specific situation and proposition.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I, I, Anseema is the trainer that I really have my eye on and the news that she's collaborating, continuing to collaborate with Colombo is very good and useful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think when we pursue that particular proposition, we'll get you guys in a loop also, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks both for sharing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter, do you have anything?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, Jon summarized it well, succinctly.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So thanks, Jon, for that.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it sounds like you have an action plan, and that's good.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, these meetings, they go on, and we don't move forward.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's good to hear that action plan being articulated, even though it might need to be refined a bit.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm glad to hear that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are trying to go to actual action, and you're right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's easy to keep on talking about what we're going to do and not quite get to it.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I do think we're getting closer.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it sounds like it.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have to jump off.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to talk with all of you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Take care.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think we can even close the meeting here, because he gave us the action item.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So thank you so much for coming.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was really great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank having me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, I'm going to send you the Fathom, the recording.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Your job is to share it with whoever might be interested, but also your job, please, is to remember what we claim we're going to do at the end of one of these meetings and begin the next meeting by saying, have we made any progress on our action plan?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because that's where it falls apart, okay?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'd like you to be the institutional memory for these meetings which you've organized.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yeah, perfect.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, thanks, everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Michael?

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll be writing a letter to people here soon, so follow up from the medicinal plant thing, so.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** These are pieces of the puzzle.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, you'll have to nag him two weeks from now, too.

**{'display_name': 'Global Earth Repair', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, hopefully not.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hopefully not.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** See you later.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, let know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Oh, hi, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Happy to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Motokani.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, how are you?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How is Kenya?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it okay?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We doing well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, we'll be starting in three minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you, Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Ikigari.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But today I'm calling from, there is a conference that is going on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, it's a forum.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a forum I hosted today.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's about, it's about youth entrepreneurship for future of agri-food system.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's really connected to what I do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it was supported by AGRA, which is Arians for Green Revolution Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, uh...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mastercard Foundation, yeah, it's a cross-regional meeting, yeah, it's just gathering, I think, six countries, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, and Burundi, so the participants are from those countries, and they are all young people who are doing climate, and related to agriculture, restoration, works, so it was amazing, hearing from all the young people, the work they are doing, actually, almost all the participants presented the initiatives, and, yeah, it was amazing, that's where I am, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Was that recorded, Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not really, but I recorded, just, I took the

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Transcript, I have the notes, because I will be also the one to do reports.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you want, I can share that with you as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** By all means.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I'd love to know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I also invited Leonard to try to figure out how we might work with the Agra Foundation and make connection to the MasterCard Foundation.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if you've made any progress there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But often it's in the follow-ups that you make progress.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, actually for MasterCard, the issue was there is no one from MasterCard who came, but what I only saw is there is potential in collaboration with Agra, which is a big network as well, doing agricultural work in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And one of the Climate Adaptation and Resilience heads.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Head person, reading person was here, and we shared the contact, we keep in touch, I think that's where maybe we can start from, because they have so much big and big plans for youth and even supporting agricultural initiatives.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I told him that we visit the office maybe in the future, so we can talk more.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Our man in Kenya, well done, in Rwanda, well done.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so the forum will continue tomorrow, and tomorrow's focus will be, we want to, the outcome to be a statement, a youth statement on the future of agri-food system and climate resilience.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, that will be the focus, and I think we'll be very interactive as well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm excited to be part of that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe because I started that, I don't know if anyone has a question or we can do some updates and then we talk about what I want us to talk about today.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone can jump in.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I saw a video just a little while ago of Natalie Topa doing a workshop under the auspices of the World Food Program in, if I remember correctly, Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I recommend it to you all.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I'm really thinking that I think she is extraordinarily capable and well-connected person who really understands these issues.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm beginning to wonder what it would take to get something like that going in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So the video...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This includes an academic from Uganda who participated in that event.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So in a few minutes, I'm going to share the link in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm going to recommend it to everybody just as a model of what can be done, and I think a right way to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then maybe in the future we can talk about trying to connect with her.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have a week.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've had some connections with her in the past.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And perhaps to try to organize something with her program, which is called Olara.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any other person?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe Peter?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter, do you have any help with it here?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** more.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just, you know, some of the discussion we had last time about self-financing and savings and credit groups, and I'm not sure any idea of a collective proposal, I mean, I don't know where that is, and a very short notice, but hopefully helpful presentations that you organized, that was well done.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And lots of information there, how do we spread that, that approach to, you know, using agroforestry and associated techniques for ecosystem restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's, I'm just sort of in a listening mode to know what next steps are.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks to bring that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I, I was thinking even to ask that one, maybe, don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, to talk about it, if there is any progress made on our last action, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I can't say there's been progress made.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ananda, why don't you go?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, nothing is finalized, but there is a lot of weaving going on.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're accumulating a list of people's projects, and we have a tool to find potential foundations that might be amenable to giving money to that type of project.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's initially something that takes a lot of work, but takes a long time to connect up.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** something we could of And we've all Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Although, in the process, there's been more and more connection building between different organizations who are members, like, for example, the different organizations that are all working within the Naka Valley Refugee Camp, starting to identify more synergies and ways that they might collaborate and help each other out.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** been working with Belizi, who has just appeared here, and Moses, different different ERA members and other people that are trying to like, so we're, we're spinning the web, you know, we're creating the web, we don't have any real tangible results yet.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But yeah, I think there's a lot of work of

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Getting to know people and connecting and talking about collaborations that will eventually lead to progress.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I can be a little bit more concrete because, Peter, you have, course, asked exactly the right question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And frankly, the struggle is to go from knowing what ought to happen to actually making what ought to happen happen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And we are still working our way.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But it's also true that since the last meeting, Colombo has managed to keep his project in Nakavali alive, and I think we played an important role there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's and that could become a site for some of the kinds of things we talked about permaculture or entrepreneurship training.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it's not like we've done nothing, and it's also the case, and I don't know if you saw it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So looks very

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But Evan has given us his blessing for supporting Moses' project as a fiscal sponsor.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So we are doing what we can to support our African members as they try to move these things through.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, we also need them to show us where the gaps are that we are actually capable of filling.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think that's the update right now, Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're working at it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Colombo.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** is still noise here.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Muslims are still praying.

**{'display_name': 'mbilizi Kalombo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe we'll just give them a few minutes to finish their prayers.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so today I think we can brainstorm about the thing that I already mentioned it to Jon, which is World Agroforestry Congress, which is happening in Rwanda in October 20 to 24th.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think this is very interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Personally, I wanted just to bring it to Africa members and even wide members of EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was thinking of maybe doing something around it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe, I think the possible thing is a side event, or maybe exhibition, but I don't know if we have things to exhibit.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The site event make more sense.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Either people are here on the ground or even some people can participate online if we really organize that very well, but having something representing CoRestoration Alliance, so maybe I can share, I think I can share my screen to give you more details about this, and yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope you can see my screen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, sir.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, people from high-income countries are supposed to pay $350, and students and farmers from these countries, $140.45, but I've checked for most of African, they're supposed to pay $110.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 100%% 100%% 100

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or registration, and the regular one is $245.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think the interest that is there is the people that I've seen that will attend, like agri-key prayers in agroforestry, and I think it's a good way for us to really connect and engage with this kind of like-minded prayers.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, I personally submitted an abstract before, but they didn't reply yet.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just I did one for my project that I'm doing in Rwanda about agroforestry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not a research paper, but a submission for abstract ended in May, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the Congress...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Focusing on many things, especially contribution of agroforestry in climate change and agroforestry biodiversity and ecosystem services, agroforestry for improved livelihood, you know, it's all about agroforestry, so many things, even our members in Africa are doing mostly, and I think even not only in Africa, even other members who are doing agroforestry-related work and agriculture work should be interested.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, these are the featured speakers, like the main, main ones.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is our Ministry of Environment, Valentin, and Patrick from International Union for Agroforestry, and Eliane from ICRAF, CFO, this is World Agroforestry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And our CEO of Rwanda Green Fund.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is a big fund that is promoting green projects in Rwanda and restoration projects.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So these are the main speakers.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know what people think about, or maybe if they want to read more details about this, but I think from what I said, we can maybe brainstorm on how you think we can do anything if you think it's something interesting for EcoRestoration Alliance, especially for African members.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if some of us knew this before or had interest to join or to participate or to host anything.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm curious to know, but also I will send this to other members who are not here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So yeah, the floor is yours now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will put the link.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The conference website in the chat now.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, can I take a first stab at that?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I know Patrick Worms very well.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I worked with him.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, work with him.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We've had a lot of exchanges because he's also part of the Global Evergreening Alliance, as I am.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we've met, he came to see some of the FMNR work, supported by World Vision and other, the Regreening Africa program in its first phase, came to Ghana, and I met him and we went touring together.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So he is an excellent speaker, an excellent promoter.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I also know the ICRAF C4.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know her personally, but I know of their work and they're engaged in a number of different, very exciting programs.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, .

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Having said that, my understanding of the Agroforestry Congress, it tends to be quite scientific in its scope, and there'll be speakers, but I think, you know, like C4 and ICRAF, they're one of the CGIAR, now Unified Group, so, you know, the most of the people there, they will be submitting, if I, I never went to one, but I've read some of the outcomes, more, yeah, scientific might be too strong, but quite, you know, strongly evidence-based and, yeah, scientific, so I'm not sure what you're thinking is about the benefit of us, or some of us attending, unless we want to

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If something, which I don't think we're in a position to do, I could be wrong about that.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or if we attend maybe a side event of some kind, certainly I can't, you know, pay to go to all the way to Rwanda, even though I'd like to, or pay, you know, even the participation fee is quite, it's more of a networking among people that are sort of higher level Yeah, more than practitioners, scientists and so on, engaged in higher level programs for agroforestry.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe you could clarify what you see as a potential benefit for us, ERA, in doing this.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know if any of that makes sense, but that those are my initial impressions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I get you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think what is really...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If possible and what can work for us, first, I think it's hosting a side event because the application is open, like having our own side event, one or two, I don't know, because I also applied one for my local initiative because there are so many thematic areas that are really based on community engagement and livelihood improvement.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think as ecosystem restoration, first, we can do that kind of side event, but also try to engage these high-level people because even if they will be in a high-level conference, like the main alum, but also they can still participate in side events as speakers and also people meet them, you know, in the conference halls and whatever.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And sometimes you can even, you know… know…

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ask them an appointment while you are there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If they have time, they can have a dinner with you, or whatever, or meeting loans.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the first thing always is connection and the networks, because when you don't meet someone, there is no business, I think, from my side.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's what I was thinking, for people who can make it on the ground, but also there is another way that we can do, especially because I'm here in Rwanda, if people can't make it, maybe I can organize everything and then invite people to speak from their homes through the screen online engagement and then talk to the audience.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that will be kind of letting people know that EcoRestoration Alliance is there, and again, engage with some audience, but also...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you know we will be using our social media that we are engaging in that event yeah sometime and most of the time things may come that that's what I think yeah can I can I sorry I didn't want to dominate but um just another quick reaction to that um you know the co-presenter of our recent webinar is his name is Lucky right is he not from Malawi Malawi is not that far from Rwanda he's from Uganda oh yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uganda rather sorry um well that's right next door um he he had such an excellent presentation and his concept um and his work and his practical experience um I think really and you know as an african as a Ugandan um he'd be much more suitable for an agroforestry congress in in in Rwanda you know if Iraq know if

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We could find ways to have him go and present with you based on his work and then other work that we want to perhaps highlight that would represent ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that would be excellent.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then he would be a much better suited person to network and coordinate and so on with you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Being alone, I've been to some of these conferences.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You don't even know what sessions they go to.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you could double up having someone as enthusiastic and as seasoned and as impressive a speaker as Lucky, I think that would be helpful for ERA if he could also go.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's just a suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I really like his farm forest.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, you know, that's what he was presenting for me is like in my concept of farm forest approach, which is also another approach to agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Agroforestry, sort of distinct from what I presented.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's more like, if I can just briefly outline this, like in Senegal and other places, just making a live fence made from acacia trees, and then within that, where there's water, put in all these other types of trees.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's called a farm forest approach.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But anyway, that, you know, that concept, I think, needs much more emphasis within the agroforestry realm.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, I would really support, if we could, lucky going to join you there and help you co-present a, you know, something from ERA as a side event.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's true.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think also, it's not even lucky alone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, I don't know if people should be interested maybe in using buses, which is more cheaper.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would also bring some people, like, think about some people.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like Mohanji, like, you know, other people who are doing amazing works around, because, like last time I went there by bus, though it requires some time, but yeah, I don't know if people should have time to do that, but also, yeah, what you are saying is true.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, think Peter's idea is a great one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think upping the ante and imagining a bus and lots of people going may be too ambitious a proposition if we can't get additional funding, but I agree that Lucky was really an exemplary speaker.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I know one of the featured speakers at Agroforestry, Patrick Worms, and he's spectacular.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So this is going to be a good conference.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it would be worth talking to Lucky and thinking about what is our strategic goal.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And attending that meeting, it would be certainly good to network.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It would be great if, for example, we had some ideas about what would come out of it that would be more than just conversations and visibility raising.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But the truth is, I think that the people at that conference are some of the people we would like to, for example, get to Don Cavalli or something.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So just giving some thought to what we're trying to do with the event.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But I would be proud to be represented by Leonard and Lucky, for example.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard helping with coordinating.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Lucky, perhaps, has a speaker representing the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And when that falls in place, then we think about, is there a way of bringing other people there as well?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'd like to have a follow up conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I would say that's the next step, is to talk to Lucky, learn more about him.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I certainly would like to develop his collaboration with us in the ERA, and let's see if that develops into a plan for this agroforestry conference.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but also, yeah, I think even we need to ask him, because sometimes he should even have a plan to come.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Why not?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I've seen that he's really much engaged with agroforestry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm quite sure that he knows about this event.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe he will even come.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that will be much, much easier.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** so Leonard, can, you're the person to carry this forward, to try to make the connections, probably arrange a meeting with, sir.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Certainly you, and Lucky, I'd like to be there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Anyone else who wants to be there should raise their hand.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But just see what might come of that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can see Moses in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Moses is another.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So there are two issues.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One is what would be our event and strategy at the conference, and the other is, how do we manage to get all the people who'd be interested in getting their there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And that may require that they will have to figure that out.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks for calling it to our attention.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, can I come in?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, I didn't put up my hand.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, John raised a very important point.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What is our strategic objective as ERA to be there?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** let's When little

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And although most of the people there will be either scientists or higher level people in institutions doing agroforestry, I would expect there to be funders or potential funders there.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I keep coming back to the idea of some sort of era, collective, regionally oriented proposal, right, where we would identify our strategic or competitive advantage, which is more, I think, which is more community oriented, grassroots based work with our network of members, especially in East and Southern Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And having something sort of a concept note or something in our pocket that we could sort of refer to.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, I hope I'm

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not exceeding my bounds, but that's a suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you're occupying the space.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would love to have you occupy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's exactly right.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, does that make sense to you?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, I've been to quite a few conferences.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You meet good people.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You make connections.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, you know, Jon has raised the right word, strategic, for ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, one of our key limitations now is funding.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And part of the networking is not to, you know, immediately say, well, how can you fund us, but to make those personal connections, and then follow up and then see where collaboration can occur.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that might be an occasion to do so, based on the, you know, good work that some of the network members, including Lucky, or mainly Lucky that I know of, could help bolster.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** work work that some some some some

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Peter, you have some experience in succeeding in this kind of a venture, correct?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Your past work has brought you to conferences, and you've encountered funders, and you've pitched them, and you've gotten some support in the past, right?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, on behalf of Groundswell, I went to represent Groundswell at a recent agroecology meeting in Tanzania.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I met with Rockefeller, and I met with, you know, but it takes some active, you know, engagement and identifying who might be potential leaders, and it led to a connection that was beneficial for Groundswell in terms of the GIZ, the German Development Agency, and they, yeah, and one thing led to another.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm not sure if there was any funding forthcoming, but there's some foundations as well.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So yeah, it doesn't always work.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's no formula for it.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we're in a very competitive stance, as you've alluded to before, which is true.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, but still, there's no harm in trying.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, so I say that just to reinforce that I think it's terrific that you're coaching us on this, and I want to encourage you to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, Ananda and I, and I think all of us are very aware that it's a difficult environment, and that we need to get better strategically and in terms of implementing our strategies if we're going to get this kind of funding.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This is a good example.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So what would follow from what you're suggesting?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It would be great to do some exploration, Leonard, and see what kinds of funders might be at the meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** important?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What kinds of connections we have to them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** With regard to, concept note, to have in Leonard and Lucky's back pocket, if you will, you know, I'll just say that I still think that we have a couple of propositions that are quite strong right now, in principle, but we're not quite strong in figuring out how to get them funded.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, Nanda has raised her hand.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You might want to take it from here, or I can articulate what I think of those propositions.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I just wanted to say we have a new guest here, Greg Jones, who is connected with a foundation, I see.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I would love to have him introduce himself and perhaps weigh in on this topic, because he may have some very relevant experience.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm looking at Greg's door.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are you with

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is that correct?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, while we're waiting for him to return, I will say that we have, and this is partly our challenge, we have a number of interesting propositions at a number of levels of organization.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We have not latched onto one in particular, but let me just enumerate some things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The refugee camp proposition, I'll just allude to it, and in one sentence, there are places like Nakavali, where we've identified some very inspiring young leaders like Kalombo, and Roland, and Marius, and we have the sense that if they could work together, then large numbers of climate refugees could become climate… …

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Solution experts, while bettering their own lives.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's sort of the refugee climate champion scenario.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've also identified a network around Lake Victoria of people who are interested in creating ecological innovation hubs, and Ananda's visit within the last year went a long way towards introducing them to each other.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And identifying a potential network that we think we can facilitate.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think those are our two major initiatives right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One is trying to develop things with Nakavali as a pilot refugee camp, and the other is trying to act as facilitators of an emerging network of restorationists in the Lake Victoria area.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think we have concept notes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** have concept notes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** For both of them, actually, at this point, and maybe we should unearth them, share them with Peter to see what he thinks of them, ask Leonard to look into the funders' question, and let's see if we can't get a little more adept at being strategic.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Peter?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that sounds good, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'm still relatively new to ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, unpacking a bit the concept of strategic, there are a lot of agroforestry projects out there, so if we had a concept note and so on, then, you know, what would be, what you know, competitive advantage?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or what would be innovative about it?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not quite sure that we're there yet.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** we could emphasize, like, what is the sort of identity or branding, if I could use those concepts, you know, I know they come from another field of endeavor, but, you know, they do have some application to nonprofit and networks as well.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if we did want to, again, another sort of word, pitch ourselves at a conference like this, or to, you know, any other financial partner, potential financial partners, then we need a hook of some kind.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm not sure that we are there yet, but forgive me, because I've not been part of many other previous conversations that you've had.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Perhaps the idea of working with refugees in refugee camps for agroforestry or agroecology could be one.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe working with youth or mobile.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we need to hone down a bit more because working with communities or developing these hubs where we spread with community involvement and having sort of a special expertise in that, you would know better, you and Ananda would know better and Leonard than I.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, you know, it's not yet clear to me as a relative newcomer about what is, you know, one or more of our distinctive competencies with ERA that would interest potential financial partners to any sort of concept note.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll just make that point.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think I think I you're I think you're right in your diagnosis.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I mean, we can we can identify the elements, but we certainly haven't.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've down our unique value proposition with regard to ERA Global and ERA Africa, and that's exactly what we would need to be strategic when we get there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I do think you've identified some of the key elements.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The other key element I would identify is that we have a global network of experts, like Ananda, for example, who are on tap.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** As a brain trust for this kind of thing, and as you can see, maybe we're not unique in this regard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We are using Internet communications to sort of connect that global community to these local issues.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think that's the other piece I would add.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think that's definitely a big part of it, that we are an alliance, and so we are like a brain trust.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That we have access to experts from all over the place that we can call on and put together collaborations.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think another major feature is our kind of raison d'être, our main thing is that we are advocating ecosystem restoration as a climate mitigation strategy.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So just that knowledge about how doing things such as regenerative agriculture and agroforestry are part of a climate mitigation strategy that restores watersheds and outlining the importance of doing these things in such a way that people also meets the needs of communities.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So trying to reconcile that – that urgency to access.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For climate mitigation, but also making, giving people ways to to meet their own needs, while at the same time being restorers.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if that...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No, I think that's, I agree with that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That is sort of the core unifying feature of ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The question is, how do you bolt those attributes together to make a clear and distinguishing proposition?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Peter's probing questions are helping, so here comes his next probing question, or trenchant comment, or perhaps just a little bit of rambling.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Another bit of rambling, maybe.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will express my own, I don't know what word to use, bias or inclination might be a better word.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** again

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And stated because I'm not part of the, I haven't, yeah, I'll leave that, I've already articulated that, but my sort of interest or what I would find interesting and for a potential area of exploration to discuss is this whole idea of, as an alliance, having grassroot level members, is this idea of learning hubs.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we have, let's call them centers of excellence or lighthouses, you know, that can, that are doing good work.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then through our members in a regional context, probably finding ways to bring in other people and expand or scale or amplify existing agroforestry work or agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or work or ecosystem restoration work or ecosystem different.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that could be a refugee, could be with youth or whatever, but the overarching framework would be, you know, a lighthouse thinking, or the centers of excellence thinking, or learning hubs thinking, and spreading what we already have going on.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that might be of interest to, especially at the community level, and how to do that in creating learning materials and guidance by the people within the alliance that can provide that sort of guidance.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be, for me, a suggestion for you to think about, if that's of interest.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll stop there.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that's exactly what Edward is doing.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I actually would say, all the Africans on this call are actually trying to do just that.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe a way of packaging, packaging that up, or...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** do it's

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Reenforcing it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I think that's good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This notion, and I think it's accurate, that we have been trying to identify, you know, I might think of them as acupuncture points, centers of activity where we can use our relatively limited resources to make a big difference.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Don Cavalli, Edwards, Hamlet, and perhaps helping to create this network of micro hubs around Lake Victoria begins to tell a story along those lines.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if that captures ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Whether that's coherent enough, Peter, for Peter's critique, but there's a little diagram that tries to just order some of the issues we're talking about.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Edward, you're here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I didn't realize that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** As you can see, we are thinking of you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, Jon, I think that resonates with me.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the Great Lakes Regional Perspective, I've mentioned that several times, makes a lot of sense.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's appealing and provides coherence geographically or, you know, ecosystemally.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's system-oriented as well as, you know, in terms of our network and our sort of concentration of potential members.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so, yeah, that makes sense.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So perhaps the next step would be to develop a concept node based on sort of the brainstorming we're doing now.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And since, Jon, I was pleased to know that you know Patrick Worms, because he is, as you've said, an excellent advocate, and especially interested in community-oriented types of things.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And some of the discussions I've had with him or, you know, in our evergreening, global evergreening alliance has been around this idea of spreading and amplification.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know he's interested in that, that we might or you might want to reach out to him since he's a featured speaker.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of it's very dedicated, can 싹penser and you

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And just say, you know, these are some of things we're thinking about within ERA, do you have any suggestions, and who might we meet, and would you, you know, ask for his support, because he's going to be there, and he's very well-connected.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he's an ERA member.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he, pardon me?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He is an ERA member.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I didn't know that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I had forgotten that myself.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, then, all the more reason to reach out to him, and saying, what can we do, and can we organize a side event, what suggestions do you have, get him, you know, more involved.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know he's very, very busy, but that might be a way to, to get some, you know, more insights into how to structure this to be of strategic value for us.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it would be great to do a little more homework about.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Um...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, maybe not.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I guess I am particularly interested in the, in the question of what potential funders or allies might be there so we can see if there's a concrete goal we can ask them to help us achieve.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think that's true.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I don't know if, because some conferences, they may even share the list of participants, like participating organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not sure if that one is available for this conference, but, uh, we can still ask.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter, you want to speak?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I'm trying to read.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Am my hands still up?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but, uh, I didn't get to worry who is going to think about leeching out to Patrick.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it or Jon?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, it wouldn't be me.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It it has to be Jon, especially.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Especially since he's an ARAP member.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If that's true, then...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, that's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I'm happy to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And this brainstorming has reminded me that we have the opportunity to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm, as you can see, I'm just continually trying to refine our specific proposition.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Let me just run it past.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** First, using our Global Brain Trust, that's the Global ERA, to help latent networks in Africa cohere and develop climate-positive self-sufficiency.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And this is, you know, goaded by, by Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is it, is it true?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is it distinctive enough?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is it, uh, pitchable?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** people?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Is, Peter Frote, who's thinking...

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, no, no, I didn't know.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I sometimes talk too much at meetings and I just want to give space to other people, but it shouldn't be a discussion between you and I.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No, but I think, listen, we're in the fishbowl.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And one of the advantages in your case is that you're less embedded in it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So you're sort of forcing us to try to articulate why we think we do, in fact, have a unique proposition.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I think the network of micro hubs around Lake Victoria, if I'm reading that now, is a value proposition that would be of interest.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we can integrate into that different scenarios or different sort of sub-themes, whether it be refugee camp or youth or other ones that are lucky's work of farm.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So see see, see you

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, that seems to me like we want to make it broad enough that it's coherent and of interest, but not make it too, you know, refined so that we can incorporate different types of experiences and ways of working that reflect a more diverse network.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that, to me, makes sense.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then, you know, some of the architecture around that would be like, how does that network work?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How do we foster learning?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How do we help encourage people who are maybe more focused on their own villages or area to help, you know, spread that and how much, what resources would that take and what guidance can we provide?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there's a lot of work to be done there, but that's the purpose of the, would be the purpose of the concept note to, to spell that out a bit.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So let me suggest that, that, uh,

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And here's the revised, revised diagram, which just includes this network of micro hubs, that this should be the basis for our conversation with Lucky, and I actually think that I'd be willing to share this diagram with Patrick and just say we're thinking about participating in that conference and we wonder if what you make of this is our value proposition.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** and how you think we might make best use of the event that you're a featured speaker as.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That sound right?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yep.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, I feel I have the urge to point out to Colombo and to Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That, as we are demonstrating, we are all trying to figure out what is the strategic way of doing it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think we're all aware that none of us are playing with a full deck.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And that's actually, you know, the way new initiatives actually have to get started.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it's unfortunate that we don't just know how to open the floodgates and make things happen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But this is, as they say, pioneers always have arrows in their backs.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's how you can recognize them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're doing our best and we're trying to figure out how to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda, I see Greg Jones, SAOSO.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I've come across them before.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think they're based in South Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they are more like anti-pesticide and, but also very, you know, pro-agricology group.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're quite a very progressive group.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But have you come across them before?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't see Greg.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon Schull, Jon No, I was just curious, because he's joined the meeting, and he has not been here before, so I was hoping to hear from him, hoping he would introduce himself, but not sure what the genesis was that he ended up finding himself here today, and I'm curious.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon Do you have his contact?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, that's, for me, the SAOSO is South Africa or something, something foundation.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not sure if it's a foundation, then it might be something else I'm thinking about, but I could be wrong.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But anyway, let's, do you have his contact there?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is he a member, or I just see his name in the...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon No, actually, I think he joined the one of our meeting last time, and it's true, he's from South Africa, so I don't remember much, but...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He introduced at that time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's from South Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, I just don't recall seeing him before.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but he's not a member.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, he joined from the webinars that we did.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I just looked him up on LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My mission is to maximize philanthropic impact at the UO.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's awesome to help donors achieve their impact while giving goals, while positively impacting our students.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's at the University of Oregon.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oregon.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unless it's not the, well.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Lots of Greg Jones, I'm sure.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I'm reaching out to him on LinkedIn also.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sounds like he will be a good contributor to this conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** When he's actually in the conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, folks, I have to go.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, but I've got another engagement.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to have to leave you to continue on.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So nice talking with all of you and onwards.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Coming up to the end of the hour, which was our scheduled meeting time, right?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if anyone has any other business, because I also feel tired.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I need to go and take some rest.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think we're good.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are greetings from Uganda, and I'm happy I joined though a little bit late, but I've been following the conversation.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And please, I've been requesting to share with me the recordings of the first 20 minutes, which I didn't see.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah,

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I attend.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, I've been following.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And greetings from Eliza.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's Dizzy at the Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's here with us for two months and a half.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I didn't realize that.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's in me at the Hamlet, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, that's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, actually, we were talking about our engagement or if it's, do we engage with Agroforestry Congress that is happening in Rwanda, October.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe you can check the website and see if maybe Edwards Hamlet should engage with it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's all about the discussion that we have.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will put that in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll be very grateful if you send me the link and I'm happy that the Edwards Hamlet is again in the program for Italian Development Agency.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been earmarked as one of the partners in the country.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Uganda to plant over 20 million trees funded by the European Union, but it's under the government of Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're going to supply the indigenous trees.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll be happy.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** us some more information about that, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Congratulations.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will do that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very good.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we also, Eliza has just completed today the baseline questionnaires.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are doing baseline in the Lake Victoria Basin for the watershed.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I will share with you the questionnaire so they might start the baseline next week.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think at our next African meeting, you and Eliza need to give us a full report about what you're doing together.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, sure, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We will.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So thanks, then.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think the next...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The action item is to draft a concept, and then Jon leaching out to Patrick and see how.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And you investigating the organizations, the funding organizations that might be at that meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, then, thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have a lovely day.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I see all the notetakers are on time.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A lot of notetakers, but okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm officially declaring a note-taker crisis.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think this is a problem that needs solving.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One recording is great, but everyone recording and emailing everyone else just ain't the solution.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I suppose...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm declining all of the other notetakers.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Daniel.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to meet you.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just as a heads up, I need to, yeah, hello.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just as a heads up, I unfortunately need to leave for the airport shortly, so I'm going to be participating, but more in listening mode and probably off video.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's all fine.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you going, dude?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Heading to California for a sort of, not quite a wedding, but kind of a get-together with some college friends and then staying in L.A.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** with the cousins for a week, so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, Leonard is beating the bushes now for the crowd, which usually does show up, but rarely on time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No worries.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll I'll I'll be.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Be ready when we get started, then.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Daniel, I have not met you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Would you like to introduce yourself?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to meet you.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I imagine Jon will have me do introductions.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think I've met anyone on this call except for Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I imagine I can do introductions all at once.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the short version is until earlier this year, I worked for one of the major USAID contractors and have done about, well, almost 15 years of work, mostly overseas, on sort of economic development, private sector engagement around sort of, I guess, social and environmentally responsible enterprises.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm coming from a little bit more of, you know, economics and business mindset to some of these topics.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to meet you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Daniel introduced himself at the last town hall meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The next one, by the way.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's Wednesday at 3 p.m.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And while we're talking about discoveries like people like Daniel, I have become aware recently of the Realliance, which has projects in Nakavali as well as all over Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And there's a very sort of allied, not identical organization to ours, although they're farther along and they've got a great collection of guides, which I'm pasting a link to, designed specifically for refugee and humanitarian aid communities.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that's a relationship I'm hoping to pursue and suggest we all become aware of them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Peter, were you aware of the Realliance?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Lance?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You're on mute, Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I'm not aware of them, as far as I know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I was very impressed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think they're worth checking out.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll tell you the truth.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I also have started digging into Bioneers.org recently.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I'm embarrassed that it's taken me several years to dig into them, because they're doing a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And they're very much aligned with us.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that's good to make those contacts.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Mtokani.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How are you?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, hello.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm doing...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to see you here.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think we're starting a few understanding reminders.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll be back in a minute.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It seems like people are really late.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe it's because of summer, so I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, what if we do kind of...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Check-ins now, because we, it's been some times without checking in, so let's do this, tell us a name, where you are now, and what are you excited about in your work.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Fair enough.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Also, be aware that Daniel is going to be leaving soon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So we'll start with hellos.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm Jon Schull.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm in Rochester, New York, for the EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll pass it to Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm with Regeneration Canada and the EcoRestoration Alliance, and I'm in Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Schull available ahead and

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Eastern Canada, south of Montreal.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Should pass to someone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And Takani?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're mute, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, I'm Takani Saleh.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a refugee in the Kakuma refugee camp.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm doing a project of formal culture.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think that is what I can share.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Welcome, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Peter, maybe you want to introduce yourself?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, hello.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Peter Gubbels.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I work with Groundswell International, where I'm one of the co-founders.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter Gubbels, I'm a veteran.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Volunteer with a title of Senior Advisor.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm normally based in northern Ghana, but I'm visiting family for an extended period in Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Canada is a large place, as Ananda will admit to.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So to localize me more, I'm in Gatineau, so probably not too far from you in south of Montreal.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not too far from me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And that leaves with Moses.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Morning, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So my name is Moses Ojunju.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the founder of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We work with smallholder farmers on regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been here long enough, and I still continue to be part of this team.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been very excited to Cool.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Moses, I would be interested in your opinion on the documents that I put in the chat from ReAlliance.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It seems to me they ought to be, they're designed to be useful for people in refugee camps, and they look pretty good to me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But Takani and Moses, I'd be interested in your thoughts.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And you too, Daniel.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, all right.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will have a look at the publication.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can see it in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I'll be able to share my thoughts with you, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, have a feeling Leonard is trying to beat the bushes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Interestingly, the last couple of meetings of this group, we've had 10 to 30 people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Today, we have very few.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But Daniel, one of the.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One of I wanted to hear more about from you was this notion that there are a lot of people like you knocking around these days who are highly experienced at the kind of sort of supporting grassroots development work who are suddenly at large and whether there's some way of tapping into that USAID refugee community.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think that's a great question.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Still something I'm figuring out myself.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe just by way of an introduction for those of those of you who joined a minute or two later.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Daniel Langfitt.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm actually just a little bit further south from our Canadian friends in northern Vermont, where I live, but I've spent...

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I guess I spent about half of my 15-year career in international development living and working in Haiti, Mozambique, and the eastern DR Congo.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was in, for the Ugandans, I lived in Bunia in a Turi province and spent, you know, spent a bit of time in Kampala now and then when I needed to shop for things or needed somewhere with stable internet.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, so really worked, really focused on economic development work in really fragile environments and the sort of subspecialty that I work in, which is called market systems development, really focuses on figuring out sort of, you know, economically viable ways and even like commercial models for making economies more inclusive through more socially and environmentally responsible business, sort of, business plans.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we'll do work, like, directly with communities.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** communities or with government or on policy sometimes, but we tend to be really focused on figuring out, you know, what models work and how can we make, you know, businesses and their suppliers or clients more effective.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I, you know, did a variety of roles and sort of the other half of my career when I've been based in the U.S., I was, you know, frequently traveling to a lot of these places, including, I don't know, Cote d'Ivoire, Kosovo.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, Madagascar on sort of, you know, a variety of, of, of assignments.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I also did some, um, work on, uh, sort of, uh, like high level innovation programming, um, sort of more directly with, uh, USAID.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, um, I've been around for a while, um, and then with all of the changes, uh, that happened at the beginning of this year, um, my, you know, sort of former employer is, is still around, but, but much smaller.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I, I, I, I, I, I, I them.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Since we have, you I've worked for the EU as well, like we have some clients that were not the federal government, but like many have, you know, massively downsized.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I've been using that time for a little bit of a sabbatical because I felt like I could use a break and was lucky enough to be able to afford it.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But also to do more, you know, sort of volunteer consulting and volunteer work around things that I thought would both, they were both important in this kind of turbulent time and also would help me learn and sort of expand my horizons as I figure out what's next.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think to sort of seg into your question, Jon, the, I think the profile of, of all of these, you know, ex USAID employees and the much larger number of USA, ex USAID.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Project employees and USAID partner non-profits and contractor employees, which sort of doesn't get covered as much in the media discussion of this, but we're a much larger number.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And unlike USAID staff who had a rough time, but they sort of got paid out through September and things like that, and only recently actually officially left their jobs.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Most of us have been, we're sort of summarily fired, you know, like last week of January, first week of February, and so have been sort of exploring a very chaotic job market.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I would say that many folks have responded by pivoting, sort of pivoting away.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in areas like communications, or project management, or even just proposal writing, I have a close colleague who just shifted into the IT sector because she needed a high-paying job.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and health insurance for her family, and within a couple months was able to get a proposal writing job for an IT firm.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some more, you know, generalist folks have been able to move into other industries, but for those of us that have, that are sort of committed to international development, um, uh, like, these values, I would say, uh, there have been a few people, there are a few people who have, like, gotten something, um, adjacent to what they were doing, often with, you pay cuts, um, many people sort of have been forced to sell their homes, um, and downsize just to, like, adjust to the new reality, but for most of us it's been sort of intermittent consulting gigs, um, and a lot of, um, unhelpful job applications, and so I give that kind of, like, personal, um, background, um, because as you are thinking about maybe, uh, former colleagues of yours who are talking and sort of networking into...

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Into these folks, or even just like looking on LinkedIn, or for people with expertise in these areas, just be aware that like everyone's situations are quite different.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, some people, you know, sort of have the financial wear with all and the health and, you know, um, maybe a spouse who is the primary, um, you know, income earner, uh, and don't have like medical liabilities or mortgages and have been able to weather things more or less okay and others are in, um, pretty rough shape.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think there is a, there is a mix of people, I'm getting a little bit of feedback, um, the, I think there's a big mix of people and it would be useful as you're sort of exploring or, you know, making contact with these people to figure out, are they people like me who can sort of, you know, afford to be employed, you know, or semi-employed, um, for six to 12 months while I figure out what's next.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm actually really eager to talk to folks who value the things that I do, since I don't sort of get to do my job as much anymore.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And other people who really, you know, they are in really dire straits and they need to spend, you know, every minute they can either, you know, looking for jobs or, you know, doing, you know, little consulting work or other things like that.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think that that's, you know, that's a fair thing if you make contact with somebody to just ask them, like, where are they in this process?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What kind of time and energy do they have?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And to sort of calibrate what you can get out, you know, what you can get out of that relationship.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what I would say is for folks like me that are more sort of technically focused, whether it's an environmental, you know, environmental or climate change mitigation adaptation area, or if it's private sector engagement or economic.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So development or health or work in, you know, sort of like countering violent extremism or working in the humanitarian or refugee space.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Most of us feel to some extent like all of our, you know, sort of our whole careers have been under sort of under attack and a lot of work was a lot of hard work was undone.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And generally when people have, you when they have the time and energy to talk to you, that really does them some good, right, to hear about the initiatives you're taking and to understand that their experience is valued.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are a lot of WhatsApp and Signal Groups that I know of that are, you know, sort of former, a lot of sort of people that were formerly in this space.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some of that is, you know, connected to job networking.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if I were to recommend to, you know, ERA, how to approach.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would think about starting with people like me that you already know, and just sort of talk to us about what kinds of challenges you're facing, what kinds of advice or expertise you might be interested in.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And keep in mind that, you know, for different organizations, we're going to be very tightly networked with our former colleagues for the most part.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, for instance, I know, you know, I know almost all the former technical experts from DAI, which is, I don't know, you know, 70 or 80 people around the world, as well as sort of a subset of project staff.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But then if you look at another implementer like a contractor like Chemonics or a nonprofit like ACDI Voca, they'll be sort of their own network.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there's some like overlap.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if I were in your shoes and trying to tap into tap into that, that.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Network and sort of figure out, figure things out.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would be trying to cultivate, you know, some people with long tenure at, you know, one or more of the, you know, different implementing partners for USAID.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For, you know, so for like the Ugandans on this call, I actually haven't done a whole lot of work in Uganda, but my colleagues have and DAI had a lot of projects there.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Those people all know each other because they've worked together on generations and generations of USAID projects.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then sort of the different bureaus within USAID.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think if you can sort of cultivate, you know, one person who kind of understands what you're doing and is willing to help you network, that would be a really efficient starting point.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And maybe I'll stop there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very, very interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, it makes me realize that the people who are.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're fired from USAID are the tip of the iceberg.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Then there are the contractors like you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then, of course, there are all the people on the ground who were engaged and benefiting from the work of the contractors.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And there's probably a five to tenfold expansion as you go from, you know, former USAID employees to contractors to collaborators and beneficiaries.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Which is to say, that's a lot of people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I'm curious as to whether, I mean, you know, these are all potential workforces, not that we know how to employ them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm wondering whether there are any ideas afoot as to how to take this, these cohorts of trained and pre-aligned people and organize them into some new energy.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That will be able to carry on the work under some other model than, you know, USAID largesse, even, and I call it largesse, ironically.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it was a tremendous contribution and investment, and it's just ridiculous that we've pulled the plug on it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But that was an editorial.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** My question is, there any moves to reorganize this community under some other kind of model?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not that I'm aware of.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm probably not the, like, the very most informed of the sort of ex, you ex USAID, ex USAID contractor implementing partner, ex USAID project staff people.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'm also not the least informed, and I, you I talk a couple times a week with different, you know, cohorts of former colleagues, partly for, you know, more.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And partly to sort of continue learning from each other and keep tabs on what everyone's doing.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What I've seen so far has mostly been a little bit more opportunistic.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A lot of the, you know, some of the organizations that used to be like, I would say like medium-sized players in that space, like TechnoServe, because they didn't have as much USAID work, you know, maybe it was 20% or 30%.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 30% of their portfolio, they are still high, you they will still have consulting assignments.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So my colleague Melanie actually was just out in Uganda to do some new business work, some proposal preparation work for TechnoServe.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think she got, you know, she got like a two-week consulting contract or something for that.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, there are other, I was actually on a proposal as well for actually some work in northern Quebec that would have been cut.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** New and cool for me, mostly because it would have had me driving around Northern Quebec in September and October, but we didn't win that proposal, and that was bidding, that was going to be a private sector client.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think it's been, I think because a lot of the, you know, there's sort of shells or sort of smaller versions of the previous structure, Jon, I'm not seeing like new patterns emerge yet.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But part of that is just because, you know, there are hiring freezes in place with almost all the usual suspects.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I think that there's so much uncertainty about what the money will look like, where it's coming from.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To editorialize a little bit, one of my frustrations has been with sort of large, like big philanthropy right now, and sort of the opportunity that they would have, for instance, to sort of constitute a new team.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, they're the ones with money.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They could draw on right now with, you know, sort of a global recession kind of looming or already here for some of us.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, you know, the university system under fire and most, like, bilateral donors and multilateral organizations facing big funding crunches, there's a big source of capital, you know, like, there are giant endowments for philanthropies and there are folks like Gates and others that have committed to spending down their endowments.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But they're not moving, based on everyone I've talked to, to do anything really strategic and proactive.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody I've asked about how is philanthropy approaching this is very conservative and trying to, you know, sort of, what would you say in English, circle the wagons, really protect their existing partners and help their existing partner base that's lost funding from so many other sources.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I've been, I work about, I volunteer work about, for.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're about 15 to 20 hours a week with one of those organizations in northern Vermont that does refugee resettlement.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Foundations are not interested in, or most of them do not seem to be interested in new things and new initiatives, which I'm a little bit angry about, not just because it would help me and my industry and would help a lot of struggling nonprofits and new exciting initiatives like ERA, but also because I think it's a strategic blunder that could actually sort of undermine sort of progressive philanthropy in the long run if they don't take a really, really strong stand and put a lot of money where their values are right now.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm not seeing that, and I would, you know, I'm certainly not just one observer in the sort of borderline chaotic system that is the sort of ex-USAID world and international development world right now.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But my take is that it's still a little bit too chaotic to predict any emerging trends.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the informal networks are there.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, I mean, if someone was like, you know, I don't know, if some philanthropy was like, we want to hire a new climate mitigation team, and we want an amazing team of the top experts, you know, next week, they could probably have, you if they put a ton of money behind it.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And sped up the paperwork, they could probably have it just import that team, essentially, as you said.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I just haven't heard about anybody doing that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I put my hand up to encourage other people to put their hands up.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you still have a few more minutes, Dan?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do, and I will be, I will stay on the call on my way to the airport and things.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was just giving you a heads up before that, you know, that's why I'm just not on video.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm putting the last things in my bag.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I call.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I do have a few more minutes to talk.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I was touched and heartened to hear you say that having people like us who appreciate what you do and who might be able to avail of your services is encouraging rather than maddening at this point.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So for those who came late, I'm going to point out that Daniel is an expert, formerly a contractor with USAID, whose specialty was helping develop commercial and market value chains for people doing permaculture or agriculture or other things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** in DRC and in other countries in the region.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I wonder whether Leonce, who, if I recall, is from DRC or Klimian, might like to introduce themselves and also...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Ask any questions or identify any potential commercial or sustainability initiatives that they could use some advice from, about, use some advice about.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, good morning, good evening, everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good morning, good evening.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, we do hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm afraid you don't hear us.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, can you hear me, please?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that's not going to work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, to work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well,

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm from the Democratic Republic of Congo, now I'm here in Jinja, which is in Gomba, Yudhavu.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, we hear you now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I said that I'm here in Jinja, prisons of the war as refugees here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, I'm from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we work on agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm the national coordinator of a NGO called Save the Planet.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We work in Gomba, in Bukavu, and we are thinking how we can extend activities to other provinces.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's very good, Leonce.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What kinds of agriculture are you pursuing, for Daniel's benefit?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have like 1,000 farmers who work on coffee.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And on that sector, we are trying to to make agroforestry and agroecology to help them producing more and get other incomes from the other activities which are associated with the coffee.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that is being done in Kalehe, in Kazeba, in Kamaniola, in the plain of Ruzizi.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the line we them style,

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And at Ruchuru, but now because of war, any activity is being done now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And those, Khaleesi is in the DRC, so your 1,000 farmers are still in the DRC at this point, yes?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, they are still in DRC, they are in Kalehe, they are in Minova, they are in Idri, they are in Kaziba, they are in the plain of Ruzizi, I know you, you know it, the way to go to Uvira.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Got it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But you fled to Uganda, yes?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, but because of the war, well, now,

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, and as I'm here, there are many activities, that I can say, but they're still working, as they usually do every day.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I'm wondering, the coffee, where does the coffee that your farmers grow go?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What is the distribution system for their harvests?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Come again, I don't understand, maybe, the network.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do they sell their coffee, and to whom?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ah, their coffee.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, that is the big challenge now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Before the work, before the work come, we had like 10,000 tons that we would like to sell.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the challenge they have.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They don't have any company to buy, so that they have a big problem, and they're still looking for those who are going to buy, to sign some contracts with them, and support some activities in agroforestry, in agroecology, in empowering.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then they will not depend on the coffee, but they can have other source of revenue, and fix a good price for the coffee.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, as I understand it, Daniel, we've now sort of hit your zone of competence.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you have any ideas to offer?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sir, mean, it's, it's, I mean, Eastern, um, you know, DRC's is really tricky right now, especially, I guess I would ask Leonce a little bit about about...

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What buyers he's working with or could be working with, and what is their posture towards the security situation in the East, and what are they willing to invest in and not able to invest in?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are you with us, Leonce?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I didn't understand the question.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Who is buying the coffee?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's what I said.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For now, the coffee don't have a real customer to buy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's only some people who come, they come to the farmers and they buy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But our plan, it is what?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's to empower them, to...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** help them to develop other alternatives, other activities that will help them to get income, incomes, so that they will not depend on coffee only.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because if they depend on coffee only, they sell their coffee at a cheaper price.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are looking for those, the customers, who will buy to a good price.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that they can improve their, their revenue every year.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, no, that's, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And diversification is, is really important.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, so, you know, the, the, the sort of short version, um, you know, of, of advice there would be to see what, you know, research and networking you could do to, to, um, to,

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So figure out which, and in the East anyway, they're mostly international buyers, but you also have actors like Varunga Coffee and things, who are interested in increasing their volumes and would be willing to buy from those areas if they could meet the quality and quantity that they needed.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because often, you know, it's great to be doing the grassroots community development side, but it's most effective if this is sort of in conjunction with, you know, a single or several medium-sized or larger enterprises that can be the market, right?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because they actually have an incentive to support those farmers to produce more, produce better.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And produce on time.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's when you get into, you know, figuring out what role, that's when you get into sort of a community partnership with what we would call an offtaker, right, with a crop buyer.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so for me, like, the next step with this would be to at least figure out who you could approach, who's interested in this commercially, or maybe sort of semi-commercially.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know I've talked to the sustainability people at Olam, and they have, you know, they have a certain budget to buy kind of like higher risk crops where they know, you know, maybe they're not going to make their normal profit margin, but are sometimes interested in sort of experimenting.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's the, that's kind of the lens that I would, I would look, I would use to look at that.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are also, if depending, I'm assuming that these farmers do not have.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a lot of spare money to buy inputs, so I'm talking, for the DRC, I'm mostly just talking about seeds, but can also be tools or if they're paying for, you know, for land preparation, right, for the laborage.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is the other angle that you can often look for the private sector, and sometimes they can bundle things to help diversify.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if, for instance, there was a seed company that maybe also sold, you know, or maybe worked with seedling providers for coffee trees, or sold anything else to small farmers, that's very difficult to reach that market.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But sometimes if you can aggregate orders and coordinate with the community, then it can become profitable.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, and so if you were to work with, uh, uh, them...

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They might say, well, you know, you guys aren't going to buy enough inputs for coffee to make it worth us taking the risk and incurring the logistics costs of going up there to deliver, you know, to take an order and then go deliver the materials and take payment.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But maybe if those same communities were also interested in buying horticultural seeds, right, if they were buying, yeah, like vegetables and maize and maybe, you know, potatoes and things like that, they could say, oh, actually, like we could put together a nice partnership with a couple different seed companies where we sort of deliver all the inputs together.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So those are kind of the two angles that you can start thinking about how the private sector fits into both the coffee value chain and to some of these other value chains you want to help your communities diversify into.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'll stop there, but there's, I did put, I will note that probably at the moment, given how many resources have now gone offline, probably the single best repository of resources on market systems development and, you know, private sector engagement to do these kinds of things is held by an organization called the Beam Exchange.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I put their, um, email address in the chat, um, and they have lots of examples of this kind of, um, this kind of approach, Leonce.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, and I've also worked to get much of it in French as well, um, which is sometimes, sometimes helpful to get sort of French, French versions of a lot of these, um, uh, these case studies and, uh, approaches.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You're saying that the Beam Exchange, the Beam Exchange has case studies, including in French, of this kind of thing.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Correct.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so if you're not familiar with that resource, it's worth looking at.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because in French, we will talk more and understand one another and develop many things.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because now I'm still learning English, there is something which sometimes I don't understand.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if we put it in French, it will be like the water to drink and develop many things.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, there problem.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can speak in French with our players.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In any case, I would be happy if you could put us in contact with other organizations who are in the sector of the value chain, the production chain, see how they can help us to able to associate our farmers.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So agroecology and agroforestry, all that mixed with our coffee I even got to send the samples to the United States where we made an exchange, and the coffee had shown that it was a good quality, with 80% of the good quality of coffee in Africa produced in Congo.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Félicitations.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great news.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well done.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, so we've just been reminded that the language challenge exists, but also can be transcended by people like you and Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, my thoughts, by the way, I encourage you all to speak French, but my...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I thought listening to Leonce and listening to Daniel is, first of all, Daniel had lots of good advice in English, but I will give you a French translation using our AI sources, because he did have some good strategies that you should consider.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The one that I think I heard is that, on the one hand, Leonce wants to reduce dependence on coffee by developing agroforestry and agroecology.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That makes sense.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Daniel points out that, to do that, you're probably going to need seedlings and inputs, and that the suppliers who are in the business of selling those inputs for what you're doing, might be recruitable to act as buyers of coffee beans, if there's a symbiote, if there's a collaborative relationship with that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And also that under the present circumstances, if the agroforestry you were doing, if the complementary species you were trying to add to the coffee plantations were sources of food, that might also increase resilience for the farmers.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Those are the pieces of the puzzle that I could imagine potentially coming together.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And one small correction, except in pretty rare cases, it's rare that you can get input supply companies like, you know, companies that sell, that produce and sell seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, tools, usually they will not be interested in purchasing the outputs because they don't, it's just not their business.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're not well structured for that.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, they can partner perhaps with a, with a,

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A buyer, and there, you know, you can find examples on the Beam Exchange of this kind of thing to say, so for example, I know there is, you know, there is a lot of pressure for some of the large coffee buyers like, you know, Olam to, for instance, source its coffee from places where, you know, the rainforest is not being cut down, right?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And in places where it's already been degraded or is going to degrade anyway, shade grown, like agroforestry grown coffee, they can sell it to consumers at a higher, you know, at a higher margin, at a higher price, because consumers don't want their coffee to be causing the, you know, causing soil degradation and all these things.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you could imagine a scenario where a coffee buyer who's only interested in buying the

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Coffee also helps either investing or just encouraging, for instance, by guaranteeing to buy a certain quantity at a certain time at a certain price, and maybe offering some kind of credit scheme to bring in some of the input suppliers, right, to then go and work in those communities to sell them the, you know, the different seeds and the seedlings and other materials that they would need to convert their farm operations to something that is more resilient, right?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, an actor like Olam is not going to buy sweet potato or, you know, or pigeon peas or something else that you might be growing in association with your coffee, you know, coffee plants.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Olam is not going to sell directly tree seedlings, but its buyers might be willing.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To help you, Leonce, and the communities network with other vendors of, you know, tree seedlings or improved potato.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Tsutsanga is one company that I worked with in Ituri, you know, that does, you know, sells improved potato varieties.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like there may be some other seed companies that are probably a little bit smaller that could be recruited to sell those.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If they knew that they're, that they had customers in large numbers who were willing to pay and able to pay because they knew that they were going to produce this coffee that they were going to sell onward.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you're sort of opening, you're sort of opening up the value chain so that money can flow through in one direction and inputs, agricultural inputs and outputs can flow in the other direction.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And in a place like the DRC, if you can even find partners who are willing to, to deal with the risk of working in that kind.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A of challenging business environment.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's often effective to work on both sides, right?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You need to work on the output side, the commodity buyers, and also on the input side, the seed vendors.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Usually, you're not going to get an output buyer who wants to get into the business of selling seeds, especially in the DRC.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you're not going to get an input buyer who's going to say, OK, we'll sell you the seeds, and then we'll buy your harvest from you.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's partly, Leonce, where you, as an organization, like facilitating a market transaction, can help them figure out how to make that work.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that was a little bit more, Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** En fait, les programmes, c'est un programme...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Transversal.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Les programmes transversent des communautés producteurs de cafés avec leurs dépendants.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Les programmes visent également à lutter contre le changement climatique.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Les programmes visent également à lutter contre l'insécurité alimentaire en promouvant une agriculture, une agroécologie.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Et je suis d'accord avec vous qu'avec les autres organisations avec lesquelles on peut travailler, en nous offrant des séments comme les patates, les haricots, le maïs, ça peut être une bonne chose.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Et un second lieu maintenant, c'est la chaîne de valeur, de value chain.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Donc, lorsque nous aurons exécuté toutes les deux étapes, à ce moment-là, on arrive sur la production du café.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At this moment, local communities will not sell their coffee at a small price, but they will benefit from a quality price from international.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's the logic of the program.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and that's great, and well noted that it's a sort of cross-cutting approach, as you said, and will help with, yeah, help these farmers access a fairer price.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, that's, that's sort of how, that's sort of how I would approach, always approach those, those negotiations, right, with the private sector, is how does, how does everyone benefit from a, from a partnership.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, know a lot more about what Leonce does and what Daniel does now than I did at the start of this meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I, for one, really appreciate what each of you are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And it seems to me that 1,000 coffee farmers in DRC is a substantial target for seeing if we can address some of these issues.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have a feeling it might be useful for Daniel and Leonce to have an exchange in France to see if they can take it forward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I say that only because, Daniel, you suggested that you have an interest in providing this kind of advice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think you clearly sort of understand things at a level of organization, a level of detail that I do not.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And similarly, Leonce, it seems to me, has got a group of people who would benefit from your council.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** chat about the forum.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, would love that, and please put it in touch.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can share with the group.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So all of our emails are, I believe, in the invitation, the calendar invitation that brought us here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I will respond to that calendar invitation with this transcript translated into French.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think I can do that pretty quickly with our AI friends.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I would encourage you two to compare notes and see if there's a way of breaking the logjam here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a bridge.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I have a call coming in, and we're coming to the end.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I'm going to say goodbye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm to Leonard, the host, just in case people want to continue the conversation, but I have to go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll be with you in a second.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe we can have an introduction from Melyn Abisa, who is new to us, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Though I know I have been working with Melyn, but maybe Melyn, if you can introduce yourself to the rest of the group, it be nice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hi, Melyn.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Melyn.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, maybe she's not allowed.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Perhaps Edward could give us an update on the tour.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's doing, he has some visitors in Jinja, I believe.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Edward, are you there?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you able to share what's going on with Hamza and Elizabeth?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hi, you were muted.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if you were speaking.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I unmute you now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe you can start again.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Talk again, I'll be...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the question, I'm running short of, what was it?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was just wondering if you wanted to give us an update on your plans for the project that you're doing with Mutaza and Hamza and Elizabeth and Mubendi, in Mubendi as well?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening, everyone, and good morning from wherever you are.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy to inform you that Hamza has arrived in the country, and we are receiving him tomorrow at the Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are waiting for him, and we have engagements and negotiations with the smallholder farmers.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They will be touring.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They will be, he's going to be at the Hamlet for one month, and Elisa is going to be here for, as well, two months.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So far she has been here for two, two weeks, and we hope by...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At the end of the engagement, I can't give you a full report because we are waiting for Hamza and other parties.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then we come up with our AVN program, the Avgree Business Value Chain Network, whereby we're going to be adding, we're going to onboard 500 coffee farmers, and we try to, the center, the Edward's Hamlet is going to be facilitating marketing for the coffee buyer, farmers around.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To enjoy better prices.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As you know, the coffee prices are falling every now and then, and they are given, even if it doesn't fall, they often get the least amount.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think, Ananda, you can be a witness, when we were in Fresberg, half kilo, a quarter, a quarter, 250 grams of coffee was costing almost $18, and here, when you count, a coffee farmer cannot get $3, $4 from the yields, including myself.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this model is going to be shared with you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I hopefully, by the end of next week, if you have an engagement, Hamza, the brainchild behind it, will be able to communicate to you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So our Hamlet is just facilitating the marketing of coffee.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And today, we hosted 110 students I will share with you.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm happy that 52 tour companies have signed up with Edward's Hamlet to bring students from as far as Wakiso district in Piji, Kampala, and they visit the farm.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So again, we've got another appointment for another school.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we hopefully, by the close of the year, we will have hosted around 200,000 students.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And on the farm, well, we're trying to teach them regenerative practices.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's better to start while they are still young than training older people.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Having said so, we are still looking forward for funding, as you know, Ananda, you've built the place.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Many things are really lacking, and we need infrastructure development.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Currently, we are also offering catering services because these students need to eat food, but we don't even have the utensils, so we were hiring out, and my wife and the rest were doing the cooking.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think every day we have other wishes and other necessities which are coming.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Having said that, we are now also offering catering to the students who come to stay at the farm.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 100 students, when they are hungry, they are not even ready to learn.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is what has transpired.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This week, Elisa is working very hard, and I thank her for she's working day and night to make everything a success.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But now we need ERA support in fundraising since we got the physical support from ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I know that you are not good fundraisers, but still, if you bring one or two friends, Elisa started donating to the Z5, and Jon Schull acknowledged that the money reached on the account.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think now it's open for the whole crew to donate generously towards the Amlet.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Edward, you're making progress despite the fact that we're all trying to figure out where the money will come from.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's a valiant effort.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much, Jon, and we always thank you for your good encouragement.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are still on the track, and I hope there is light at the end of the tunnel.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I hope so, too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, we've come to the end of the hour.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think we've managed to make good use of it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I will follow up by email, as I said, and I'll see you at the next meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** See you.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you've got a special guest today.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was very helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, lovely, lovely to meet you all and hear about what you're working on.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

## 💬 Transcript

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, how are you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good, how are you?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm doing very well, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just us and the bots here.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, that's unfortunate.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sure some other people will join.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sure they will.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So how are things in Canada?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good, good.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We just, the heat spell just broke.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're breathing a little easier today.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you get a chance to read the, regarding cloud cover?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think I've sent it to you yet.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I don't think so.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Ocean Pasture Restoration and Cloud Cover.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It turns out that, speaking of heat spills, okay, it turns out that actually just 40 ocean pastures, once they're restored, you know, kind of distributed around the world, is there's enough cooling power in the clouds that are generated to...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Excuse me, to counteract all of the warming power of all of the CO2 that goes up from mankind and nature every year.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we could get that put together in, well, if we had the funding, within three years.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are those kelp forests?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pardon?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** By pastures, you mean like kelp forests?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, it's a whole amazing ecosystem.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's iron replenishment.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I will send you some stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there's going to be a meeting where I'm standing right now.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In the dining room next door with some, hopefully we will get some of this initial funding to get us started.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's all.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Investing.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's all investments.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No philanthropy is needed.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's incredibly profitable, which is good because you need to scale it up.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** need to get...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there's so much more cooling power because of the ecosystem that gets restored once you get the kelp going.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's all photosynthesis.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So once you get...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not the kelp, but once you get the algae started, that's the bottom of the food chain, and everybody comes.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Whales come from 2,000 miles away.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, this happened off the coast of Canada in 2012.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they increased the salmon catch as anticipated there'd be 50 million pink salmon.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there were two...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 225 million that were caught.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the orcas, there's a big increase in the amount of babies that were born because you have this healthy ocean pasture.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're about 100 to 200 miles offshore.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The one that was restored in 2012, they restored 12.4 million acres.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It took them two weeks for the implementation.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It took them four weeks to set up everything, get the funding and everything.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it took them two weeks for the implementation.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This was one guy named Russ George and 11 Indians from the Haida tribe, which a lot of the green groups don't like that.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They brought down 82, well, it brought down more than 100 million tons of sea.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** CO2, 82 million tons of that were sequestered in the abyss for a thousand years.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's, I mean, that's another part of the cooling.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You bring down enough CO2, you get rid of, you know, lessen the thermal blanket around us.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so it really is incredible.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will send you some information and hopefully we'll get it going pretty soon.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, there's a good meeting happening today that'll probably start bringing in the 2 million we need.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, that's investment.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It'll probably make the initial investors in Apple jealous.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, I'm kind of.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm jumping around, rambling a bit, but what I send you'll be organized, and I'll be careful not to inundate you with too much information.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I look forward to reading it.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hi, can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, we hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's good, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, last time I lost my laptop, and this one, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The time I joined it, I can't hear you, so I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I needed to remove the Zoom and come again.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I don't know if you did, like, a round of introduction.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Been a long time, so.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, uh, Russ was talking about restoring ocean.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pastors, but that is not the topic of our meeting, so we can begin.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have Peter, we have Daniel, we have Moses, and we have Takani.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, so I think maybe we can do a kind of check-in question, just because we know each other, think, we know everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So maybe saying a name, and where you come from, and how is the weather look like in your country?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe I can start.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm Leonard, I'm in Rwanda, so yeah, we are in a dry season, it's summer.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So this means that mostly we don't do agriculture, we don't do planting in this season.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I may pass to Ananda who is next to me.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Eastern Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it is growing season here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we've just had a heat spell for the last number of weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very, very hot temperatures.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And very much, there's a lot of wildfires burning across the country.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so the air quality, the air is drifting far away.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in the province of Quebec, which is not at all close, but we've had hazy skies, orange sun and orange moon on many days because of fires that are burning in the middle of the country.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The heat spell just broke today.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We had some rain yesterday.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can breathe more easily.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry, Ananda, for that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Peter?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Ananda has already said all I was going to say.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not too far from her.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe about 200 kilometers or so away.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, there are wildfires all across the country.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Newfoundland and New Brunswick, different provinces, as she has said.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so that's an ongoing thing.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yes, we had rain yesterday, finally, a little bit anyway.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm based in Canada, as I said, and I'm with Groundswell International.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Part of the year, I'm in Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm happy to be part of this meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you right now?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Peter?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, no?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's close.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then Mtokani.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Mtokani Saleh.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a refugee ANK refugee camp, which is located in a northern country of Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I do permaculture, where we train youth and clean mother on permaculture.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So our week has been well, and we thank you, God, because even the current situation which we had in camp, the protest because of the food situation, I think there are some solutions which have been taken by UPNCR and the World Food.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, even though it is not yet solved very much, but we thank you, God, because we have some few security at the moment here in Kakuma Refugee Camp.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, that is what I can share, my weekly training, okay?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And let us have a nice meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And sorry for that, Mtokani.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Moses, how are you?

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good morning.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening, team.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, we are doing check-in, actually.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Tell us, how is the weather look like in Kenya?

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's raining.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For the past few days, we are experiencing rains.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a bit cold now.

**{'display_name': 'Moses Ojunju', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are just beginning to...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hi, Hashim.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Long time.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think you are at Edwards, right?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening to all.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Hashim from Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm from Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, think, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's 4.13 now in Ghana, and the weather is cool.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are in the cool season.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** These days, for one month now, we have drizzling in the weather.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Every day, there is a little bit drizzling in the weather.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the weather is a bit cold now.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we are also doing our best to address the sustainability challenges.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The system, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For me, I'm an entrepreneur.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Again, I have my plastic re-processing plants that I process plastic weeds.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm onto it.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also, advocacy for green walls.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is what I think.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much, Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Nice to have you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe you will share more about your initiative.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Daniel, over to you.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm Daniel.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I live in northern Vermont.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm actually very close to Amanda and Peter in Quebec, but on the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** side of the border.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I have spent most of my career doing market systems development work with the private sector, mainly for USAID until recently.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, I think our, my, you know, Canadian neighbors described my weather situation very well.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We, farmers here, are dealing with kind of a mild drought at the moment, and we're really hoping and praying for more rain in the near future.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, wow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks for sharing, Daniel.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Last we lose.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you say Russ?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Oakland, California.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's been right next to the ocean here, right next to San Francisco Bay, and it's been beautiful weather.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** California, I haven't been able, I haven't had the time to pay that much attention, but the state of California California could certainly use a lot more rain.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 37., stage

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I haven't heard anything about heat spills.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sure with fires, I've been concentrating on cooling off the planet, which I won't go into right now, but I'll share some stuff with Amanda.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I see some reasons for optimism, but cooling off the planet is the key, else nothing else is going to work.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So go to the next person, please.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, I think you are the last.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So then you can move on with our agenda today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think I'll on with some updates.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think it's not the updates, actually.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did Peter talk yet?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Did Peter talk yet?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There was a woman who was here shortly named Betty, but she had...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think she left, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She dropped off, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, let's hope that she will come back.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I wanted to share some updates.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** One is that I think even today we'll be discussing mostly on capacity-building and knowledge sharing among our members, especially in Africa, because we have been doing this for a couple of months.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And thanks for Ananda who started this kind of movement.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, but before we go into that, I want to share some, let me put the agenda in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And yeah, first we, I want to tell the team, we've been discussing about many, many things, but I want to remind you that we've been discussing about World Agroforestry Congress, that is happening.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** October 20th to 24th in Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And today I wanted to talk about, yeah, especially for the folks in Africa, about Africa Climate Summit that is happening as well in September, I think from 1st to 10th, that will be in Ethiopia.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So there is a link in the chat, people could check it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And there is a Climate Justice Impact Fund for Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** This one is mostly for Africans.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think our member in Africa should check this out and see if they can apply.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I don't know if EcoRestoration Alliance can support in any ways, but I've been checking that one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Seems very nice for Africans, the people who are doing their works around climate.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And And And

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think all of our members are doing works around that, and are mostly eligible.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, yeah, I'm happy to maybe help out of this, if anyone is interested.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I tried to do application for that for my local initiative here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So I think it's still open, so people can check that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't know if anyone else has any updates or opportunity to share, then we can discuss on the business of the meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Anyone who has anything you want to share, either opportunity, updates, the floor is yours.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are you all okay?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Any questions?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So if not, I will proceed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But also I want to remind you that, sorry?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry for not raising my hand.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** wanted to ask, my own is a private company.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So am I welcome?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we are also into business.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know whether we are welcome.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not an NGO.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a private company.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a private sector.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So maybe you know, I get you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Maybe you can check, maybe you can check the link, but I hope if your company is doing social enterprise, because even mine is a company, but I applied for that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You can check the link.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That I put in the chat and see if it aligns with what you're doing.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And feel free to reach out to me if you want Is this the first time you're here, Hashim?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you could, maybe he could have some time to say more about himself and what he does since it's his first time with us.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, Hashim, do you mind using like three minutes to introduce yourself, what you do?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a climate activist and climate and environmental sustainability activist.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am working to climate change and all this, working, volunteering with...

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** NGOs like Greenpeace, ICANN, a lot of organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** volunteer.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a volunteer with a lot of organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do voluntary works.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But through my engagement with climate change and issues, I decided to put up my own enterprise.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is a social enterprise to at least also address the issues of climate change in Ghana by delving into the plastic waste minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because it's part of the three planetary crises.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's the climate change, biodiversity loss, and plastic waste minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's a very big problem here in the plastic waste minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a very big problem here in Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I decided to start with it.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we do digital transformation too on logistics and supply chain management.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** getting change, We're we're getting that's there the environment.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Renewable energies, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We deal with solar energy products too.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have a project called Green Campus, where we wanted to at least look at the schools that wanted to transit from orthodox energy systems to the green renewable energy systems like solar energy, which is common here in Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are still working on that and see whatever will happen here.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are always into climate activities and all kind of stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also into a little bit of, we are now trying to start farming ventures in some part of our region because we have people always coming to the city for punto.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank Thank the two

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Looking for greener pastures, which is not there.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we want to help them with their farms so that they can at least finance small grants to them, small money to them, so that they can continue doing their farming ventures in the villages.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not necessarily to go into the city to come and look for greener pastures, which are not there, because sometimes they come to the city, they come and sleep outside, they're looking for jobs, and they don't get the jobs, and they fall out into other meetings like drug addicts, gambling, armed robbery, and those things.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we want to stay from that type.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** want to stop that kind of situation.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are still working with this.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a very long journey, but at least with the starting one foot, will reach that.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that is my mom.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sounds like you're...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're in the right place, Hashim.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Russ?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hashim, sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you based in Ghana?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm normally in Ghana as well, but I'm visiting Canada at the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you in Accra?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you in Kumasi or where?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in Accra.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm in Accra.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was born and bred in Accra.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any part of Accra in Uveruo.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, any part of Accra, any way in Accra in Uveruo, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And do you have some sort of technique to recycle plastic?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did I hear that correctly?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, normally we have machines that do that.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have machines.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have people who are trained to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we hire them to do it for us.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we have the machines, so we hire them to resettle them.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we sell it to the plastic to these companies.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They produce these stocks, these buckets, plastic bags, plastic chairs, plastic, all these plastic that is plastic caps and plastic containers and all these stuff.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we normally recycle the waste into granules, into a product and sell it to them, so that they will continue their job.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry, Leonard, just one more question.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you have a website, Hashim, that I can learn more?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the website is corrupt, but we are now trying to create one, yeah, because it's a private one, our own is private one, it's not an NGO, but I have an NGO, too, that we, that one we need to wash, that's water sanitation and hygiene.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That one is a different organization, that one is an NGO, but with this, with my company, social enterprise company, we are dealing with a plastic piece, yeah, and we wanted it to be because there are not a lot of people in it, and there is still plastic in the system, people throw plastic around and do this, and we need a lot of effort to at least address this issue, to take it out of the system, the city will be plastic-free, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That is what, that is our aim.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you have any website, even if it's a, you know, another NGO, but it gives an explanation of the work you are doing, please post it in the chat, so we can access it, those of us who are interested.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and could you put your email address also?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I have some, some good friends in Ghana.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** that I'd like to connect you with, Hashim.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, that's great, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hashim, if you can put your email in the chat, that would be nice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or maybe some other social media, like LinkedIn and whatever.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's my email and my phone number.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, great, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So then, I think next we are going to have like 20 minutes of discussions.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** As I've been saying, specifically allowing knowledge sharing and the capacity building.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I hope you can see my screen light.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's It's You

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah, so let us have an exercise, maybe let's have very small breakout rooms of two people so that we can communicate very well, just like in a person, two people in one breakout room.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So each group will be answering two questions, like first room will answer first two questions, the second one will answer next two questions, then the last one will discuss on the last one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So, and then each individual, each individual will present on what you get from the discussion that you had.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I hope this one is clear, right?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So you will start with the first question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You are going to discuss on one question within seven minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then after seven minutes, I will bring you back to come and discuss on the only one question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And then we will go back and discuss on the last.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right, let's try this.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, this is all about capacity building, about knowledge, skills, mentorship, or any sort of knowledge sharing that may help.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I hope it's clear.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And also questions in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I already assigned you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So it's time to go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Any questions?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay, if no, let's go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is anybody there?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody's in the breakout room.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also tell us like here in Karkuma, the crops with the crops, which you can, all the vegetables which you can plant in Karkuma, we can focus like on this kind of vegetable, normally the local vegetable which the local refugees normally eat, so that is because of the climate of the Karkuma.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this local food which you normally have in Karkuma, they can work well.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And this, this person has trained how many, how many people are actually putting this into prayer.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently, currently, currently, because we are not quite spanned enough, but currently now we have five, five, ten, ten youth who we have been trained.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also, apart from that, also we have collaborated with our local farmers, which we have.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we also, they normally practice the farmaculture and kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there are farmers which came from Burundi, and some that came from Congo, they were doing farming in their country, but the time they come in kakuma, they start practicing their skill on the agriculture sector.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the kind of collaboration we normally have with them is sometimes we normally, if we get money, sometimes we normally buy seed and tools, then we give them, then we give them so that they can start.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Natural fertilizers and pesticides, like from natural ingredients, or you're buying them?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we normally buy them.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, so it would be helpful to learn how to make fertilizers and pesticides from natural ingredients that you can find around?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, we can appreciate if we have that skill on how we can apply the local fertilizer for the natural resource which we have, I think it can help us a lot.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And one thing I noticed when I was in the Naka Valley camp is that there was not a lot of plants growing around.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like there's a lot of places.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is where the soil is bare.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you have the same thing in Kakuma?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So sometimes Kakuma is very tricky in the area.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mostly normally the northern part of Kenya, like any Kakuma, so this area is normally tricky, tricky, tricky, because first of all, receiving rent is a big issue in Kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And sometimes the land we have is not good enough, so sometimes, but what we normally demand is only to apply the fertilizer.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If no fertilizer, nothing can grow in Kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Except that if you're buying the fertilizer, if you're buying the chemical fertilizer, it's destroying your soil.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you need to learn how to, to, because the soil.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, if you have the natural fertilizers made from manure and plants and things like that, the soil holds more water.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's important to learn how to use the natural fertilizers, but you also need to have a source to get those.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, from, like, grass or from wood or from animals.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So are there, is there, is there animals, are there animals around?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Nikaokuma, we have animal, but the, but we refugee, we don't have access to keep the animal, but we, only the host community of Nikaokuma will keep the animals.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, and the animals, are they, are you?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you able to get the manure?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If we can recommend and we can book earlier, we can get the manure.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you had animals, if you had animals, I wonder if you could feed them.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like say you had chickens.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So chicken, we have only two, we have only, we have two chicken.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We say we have three, we have three chicken, one, one, one, one, we have one  and two, two, and two chicken.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You do have a  and two chickens?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I mean we have, we have three.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is  and three are...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And two are hen.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they make babies?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not yet.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Not yet.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because that one, the one normally give us the eggs, We use that one normally, that one for egg.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, yeah, I'm just trying to see if it would be possible to...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to get the animals so that you get the manure, but you have to keep the animals.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, of course, that does provide some food if they lay eggs.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the manure is important, and compost is important, too.

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you know how to pick it up?

**{'display_name': 'read.ai meeting notes', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll getting up.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, nice.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Welcome back.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope you had nice discussions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been visiting St.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Louis, almost all of you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe everyone is here, so let's start sharing back.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Seems like we have like 12 minutes, so everyone will be having like two minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Please don't go over two minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will start with, I will give the floor to everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Don't be fearful if you didn't choose them by your group.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everyone has two minutes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe we can start with Peter.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, our group had an interesting talk, but we didn't, unfortunately, copy the questions down before we got into the breakout group, so we might not have replied directly to the questions, so our apologies to the bigger group for that.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But then MUTASA and I had a good conversation, and I will try to summarize that, and then MUTASA can add his comments or corrections.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we felt that in terms of capacity building and strengthening our ability to act together as under the auspices of ERA, that we need to consider forming regional networks.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And probably because a lot of our members seem to come from East Africa, then East Africa would be one of those geographical areas where we have quite a few members and that they would meet sort of independently, but under the auspices and under the coordination of ERA generally.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then the purpose of their meeting as a network in terms of capacity building would be to decide collectively what is it that we can do, what are our needs, but rather than each of us continuing to work alone, what can we do as a network that would add value to what we already are doing, maybe ending up in a joint proposal of some kind, an initiative that would help each of us to do better, and that ERA's role would be then to support, provide linkages, perhaps organize some webinars or so around certain key.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Points.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that the final issue was that MUTASA raised is that, well, we need to have somebody to have a base in East Africa so that somebody would, you know, be elected as a coordinator of that regional network under the auspices of ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's, and then Michael came in and he gave us some news, but it was just to us, and I'll leave it to Michael to give that news after our, because I think it's important, after our sharing.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, MUTASA, do you have anything to add to what I've said?

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have I captured our discussion accurately?

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much, Peter, but I can't add anything on that because you have related everything.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I have nothing to add on.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Leonard, that's our group.

**{'display_name': 'Peter Gubbels', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If anyone has any questions, if anything I've mentioned is not clear, then we're happy to, MUTASA and I would be happy to clarify.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's powerful.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe recently we've been trying to map all our members where they are located, mostly to make sure that we are basing on the regions, maybe West Africa, East Africa, where we do have so many members.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that would be good.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then let's go to Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was speaking with Takani Saleh, who is in Kakuma refugee camp.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, of course, everybody needs funding, even small amounts of funding.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because they have a permaculture teacher that is in the camp, but even so, to organize a training, it takes a small amount of money just to pay the fees.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It takes a small amount of money to get seeds and tools for people.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we were talking about getting off of dependence on chemical fertilizer.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then the challenges with being able to even to use animal manures or plants.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So there is a need to learn those skills, to get small amounts of funding, but, you know, just to do some basic, basic things.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To, to get started, but I think there's, there's also a need for training in some of those skills, so without, aside from, you know, raising money to pay people to go in person, the, I think the, the group, support groups and, and webinars and, and skill classes would also be very helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In trying to, trying to get through some of the challenges that they face in the, in the refugee camp.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, wow.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think this question, I mean, this issue is always coming back in our discussions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, everyone needs funding.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I have a simple question to everyone, but specifically to you, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what do you think we can do like as a EcoRestoration Alliance, specifically for our

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** African's member, either in terms of empowering them, in terms of capacity, their knowledge, but also in supporting their small initiatives within that kind of small money.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe Ananda can give us a reflection, and then others, I will ask the same question to other members who are in this call, to give us ideas.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do you think Ella can do, or what do you think we can do?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ada, if you want to say personally, we would appreciate.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I mean, what we are trying to do right now is, we have a few projects that are written up, that have a clear budget and intention.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we're looking through grants from...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Philanthropical Organizations and trying to match up potential funders.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So as a fiscal sponsor, that is one thing that we hope to do.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the more we do it, the more success that we will have.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, it's the first ones that are the most difficult because ERA has not been around for that long and doesn't have a track record of managing projects and funds.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the more we do it, the more attractive you become to other projects.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's what we are trying to get started.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the other piece for when we're talking about small amounts of funds is having an ERA fund.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Which is taking smaller investments from members or different people to have the capacity to receive and then administer funds to our members.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that would involve having, first of all, getting the money flowing.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And secondly, having descriptions and budgets for small projects where we could see a small amount of money accomplishing a great deal.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, just a few thousand dollars or a few hundred dollars here and there.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you can have, you can demonstrate that with a small amount of money people have taken this, it's had a great impact.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then that gives us momentum to keep doing more of that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy to hear that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I knew that Ella is doing something about fundraising and whatever with our community.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But also, I'd love to hear from other members like Michael, Daniel, Peter, and others.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Feel free to jump in.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do you think we can do to support our members, especially African members?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can see Lars' mic is open.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you can go first.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, maybe it'd be nice to hear a little bit more from Tokani himself.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What country is he in?

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just heard...

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Refugee Camp, but I didn't hear where are you located, the place.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Northern Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, since I came in late, it seems like I should be one of the last people.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, but I believe, is it, asking Ananda, isn't it, is it Sam O'Beni, Samuel O'Beni, that was looking for some funds for Nakavali, is that right?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of many.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to think, is it one of many, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, and recently, they, that they'd asked to, that for $800, they could set up a particular demonstration.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I was going to volunteer to send him $800 for one of those sites.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have, I've helped, I've sent a little bit of money to Leo at one point, I've funded Colombo and Iraghi at Camp Nacavalli, and so I have been doing small money to Africa, and I think, and that's what I can, that's the kind of scale I can afford.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would really love to get more of my friends here in the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to do similar work, you know, $1,000 here, $1,000 there, but I haven't had much luck.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'll go try again, but I think small individual funds, uh, is maybe more achievable than...

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the big grants.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think we need to aim for all levels of help.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's why the ERA fund is if we can get like recurring donations or things like that, we accumulate a certain amount of money and then we get our members to submit clear projects with budgets that where you can, you know, when you have, you know, smaller amounts of money, if you can, if you can do a lot with a few hundred dollars or a thousand dollars here and there and get good impact, that's a wonderful way to really get the ball rolling.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So anyway, that was just my, my personal suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do have some news to pass on, but maybe, you know, if you have other people that want to do report backs first.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone want to go?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Why don't you go ahead, Skeeter?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Skeeter, why don't you go ahead?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nobody's talking.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Of we're out of time.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do have to get to another meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, let me, here's my, the hot news from my end.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was just talking to Dennis Garrity of the, you know, ex-director of ECRAF, ex-chairman of the board of the Global Greening Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he's with a group called Habitat, no, excuse me, Healthy Planet Action Coalition, which is a group of a couple of hundred scientists, mainly, who are working for Earth restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they plan a major conference.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And- Creatingands and PTA Thank

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** October 15th to 16th to ring the alarm bells on how fast global warming is rising, it's much faster than, it's just been recently found out or that it's increased, the temperatures are increasing a lot quicker than they thought they were, and so we're at a real crisis time and we need to really move forward with fast action for global cooling and they have going to have a conference on that topic online, and they hope to bring in several thousand peoples including the heads of the state in Africa particularly and in also the COP negotiating team, so they're really going for reaching people at policy levels as well as the, you might say, the EcoRestoration crowd like we are.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, at any rate.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I am going to be putting on my Global Earth Repair Convergence in May, 2026.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to be trying to do something similar, a large international meeting of people that want that generation and global cooling.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so we're going to tie our conference, you know, link our conferences, I'll be promoting his.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He'll be promoting mine, mine will be later, so what we hopefully will build on whatever they achieve.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So anyway, I'm pretty excited about these dual conferences, which will be really useful for the planet.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And of course, I will be wanting a strong Africa contingent, whatever I do as well.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll be sending that information as it becomes more available.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is just very.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Breaking news, as they say, so I don't have my, I can't put anything in chat right now, but I will be sending it to the, to you all, and so anyway, it's nice to be just here briefly, even if I couldn't make the whole thing.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's really helpful when Leo sends those last minute reminders, because it caught my attention.

**{'display_name': 'Michael Pilarski', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So anyway, good to see you all, and that's my news.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, Thanks, Michael.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's great gatherings.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And thanks everyone for contributions.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also, I would not forget that Daniel said, is much, much into maybe doing some mentorship, allowing some topics, maybe fundraising, and among others.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because, and I think we need some trainings around mentorship, mean, around fundraising, proposal writing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe in the future we can do like some webinars or one-on-one, of course.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm not going to hold you for long because we are over the time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I want to only thank you so much for joining the call and hope to see you next time.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But yeah, remember on Thursday we have our webinar that we'll be talking about composting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's a powerful one that we need to join.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have Inga and Nanda and Jackson talking.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Otherwise, thank you so much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I want to say bye if no one has a question.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much for the meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How long are you going to stay over there?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just until September 2nd.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I have two little grandsons to see and my son and his wife.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, good time with family, I can imagine.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Beautiful, beautiful.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The west coast is very beautiful, very different from the east coast.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, okay.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In regards to the climate, the weather, or in regards to what?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, both.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's right on the ocean, so it's much milder.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It gets a lot of rain, and the vegetation is very different.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, it's on the seaside, and there's really, really big, like, coniferous trees, not so much broadleaf trees, and lots and lots of forest.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very, very forested.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's less agriculture there.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's more forest.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Beautiful.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That looks like a beautiful place.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it is a very beautiful place.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So how are things going for you?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Things are, we are waiting for an investor.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To have a meeting with the local county government of Wilma Bay together with us so that we can move things.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can sign MOUs and then we can start the implementation phase, which is going to start with the pilot phase for the carbon project.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that should be done.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The meeting should be done next week.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So some of the projects that you described for the lever for change grant, are you're going ahead with those things in any case?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this one with the investor is purely the implementation of a carbon project, but more or less they are related because a seed bank would be needed even in the implementation of a carbon project.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, so they are more or less related.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I just hope we can also get that money and leave us for change.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that would be amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's truly amazing to have a million dollars to carry out what you want to do.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There was an advice from Jill Wagner that we potentially should remove the aspect of a carbon project in that application.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because the aspect of carbon project makes it a really different scenario.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so she felt that we did not need to include the business side of our project in that application.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, a philanthropic contribution allows you to develop things that you can't finance in other ways.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you guys ever look into, I think I gave you the connection to Bumitra?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, you sent me the...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The website, I checked out on them, but I've not had any contact from Bumitra.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you try to contact them and they didn't contact you back?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think I emailed, there was an email for the contact and I did not get a response.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I thought maybe I needed a direct contact, someone who works there, for example, to be in touch with them and probably start a conversation.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I did not, I've not found up to date.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I might be connected to somebody from there on LinkedIn.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll try to look into that.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** See if I can.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I mean, that will be very helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Interesting, the idea of having a way to count soil carbon, not just tree carbon.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, exactly.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we've also been talking to One Carbon World.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's also a very beautiful organization that deals with carbon removal and projects like ours.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have a lot of projects ongoing now in East Africa.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They are willing to help our project from the initial stages, just that they do not give you the money to do those processes, but they can do those processes on your behalf.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if there is something that needs to be done, they get in contact with whoever is going to do that process and pay, and then that's how they contribute to helping your project and co-developing.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I had a conversation with Bowen, the CEO, recently last week on Thursday.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm looking forward to building more of that conversation going forward.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They can also potentially help.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** With the registration of our carbon projects with the VERA standards.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I just hope we can have something solid with them as well.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just looking at their website.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Something about access 50% funding to support your organization.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, to net zero, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't think your organization has to worry very much about your personal carbon footprint.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, you are at their website, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I just, I had not heard about them before.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I was just looking up their website.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, One Carbon Wild.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It looks very interesting organization from whatever I have heard from them.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, their CEO is such a warm guy.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What's his name?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ben Fogel?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's called Andrew Bowen.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Andrew Bowen.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will send you his LinkedIn profile.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Seemingly, people are not joining this call today.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do not know whether it was not advertised, it was not communicated.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, it's funny.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Usually, if you just go by the calendar, which I usually do, it's always...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like myself.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But usually, Leonard puts out stuff on the WhatsApp, and that seems to be the thing that brings the people to the meeting, is WhatsApp notifications.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I guess we're not having that.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, probably forgot today to remind people.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know what his process is, because this has happened a couple of times.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's on the calendar, but he doesn't send the WhatsApp and then the meeting doesn't take place.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, well.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I did.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've shared with you.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've shared with you Bowen's LinkedIn profile.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, where did you share it?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** On WhatsApp?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** On WhatsApp, yeah, but I can as share it here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, somebody is here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Orkus.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Andrew Bowen, he's in the UK.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good morning, this is Brendan from Global Earth Repair.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a different name on because I was in a different group.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's my gravity research organization, ORQAS.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in the morning, I saw the notification on my calendar.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was like, oh, hey, I'm actually up for this.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's funny because most of the people that come to this meeting, they only come when Leonard sends a notification on WhatsApp.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he has not sent one, and he's not here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Even though he had asked me to give a presentation on

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's composting today, but he's not here.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm so sorry.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, he works really hard.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, he's got so many irons in the fire, I wouldn't be surprised if he just passed out for a second.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, his body just succumbs to all the, you know, all the forces fighting.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And he might be snoozing somewhere.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wouldn't blame him, because I've seen what he does on social media and stuff.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So he's a very busy guy, and sometimes we drop the ball.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, or for some reason he decided that we weren't having the meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, in any case, here we are.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's a few of us here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can introduce ourselves and get to know each other a little bit and use the time.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** making time.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Moses, I don't know if you've met Moses.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Moses and I know each other.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I've run across Moses.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was editing a couple of these presentations for Michael Polarski.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I have a parasocial relationship slightly with Moses.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've seen his work.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think, were you talking in the one where Peter was speaking?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and Ananda, I've posted a piece about a book that you wrote.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Rewilding Ireland, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, that wasn't me.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, no.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The Restoring the Flores of Life.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that one.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Michael sends me stuff to put on the website.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I see faces.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** recognize names.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But there's so many, I mix them up.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm trying.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Remind me your name again.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I passed.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name's Brendan.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Brendan McNamara.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Brendan McNamara.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I haven't had a chance to change my name.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was hoping to just drop in and do my morning chores while I listen to people give presentations.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it risks to be shorter because I'm not going to give my presentation with so few people here.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Especially not people who probably already know what I have to present.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So not much point.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** point.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** seen this don't know I

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I haven't seen the whole nine yards, but yeah, and especially if it's not being recorded or anything like that for the posterity, there's not much point in that.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But yeah, that's what I'm up to.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You guys can introduce yourselves to me more.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I might just, I'm going to go on mute and try to change my name back to my name.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, good morning.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We see you, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's evening, my time.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm doing pretty well.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pleasure.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pleasure is mine to meet you.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so maybe we can just, I'll just introduce myself a little bit more about me.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I live in Eastern Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Canada.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just below Montreal on the border with the US.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I've been growing food and farming organically for more than 40 years, but mostly just subsistence farming, just not to make a business out of it.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I used to have an ag company that made soil amendments out of beneficial microbials.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But now I'm retired, and I work with Regeneration Canada and the Eco-Restoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm the author of a couple of books.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The first one is called Hydrate the Earth, the Forgotten Role of Water in the Climate Crisis.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the second one is called Restoring the Pillars of Life, which I think is the one that...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You saw through Michael, so that's kind of...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that really developed.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In a nutshell.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you've been at this for a while.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Doing this restoration thing.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's awesome.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mostly focused on soil.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But you can't focus on soil without also focusing on everything else, so...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The soil is...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What is it?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Somebody said it's an animal that's all mouth.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or something like...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that was...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My brain just doesn't work this morning.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But yeah, I'd say it's all mouth and all butt.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's just an eating, living, pooping machine.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's lots of different things.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a community, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's an amazing community.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like there's more living things in that little crust of soil than there is almost anywhere else.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And all of those little creatures end up being part of just about everything else in our guts.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's quite an amazing thing.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we've just learned about it.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, it's pretty recent.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's only recently that they discovered the extent of the microbiome.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so this is the, there's the post that I made about you.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's, yeah, restoring the life to me, that graphic for that.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, yeah, and it's right next to the lineup.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And was like a week later that we had this, the, we are the arc, so.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this is the webpage where we post books and progress and different things like that.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** the blog, but, like, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda Fitzsimmons is cool.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I admire the work you guys do, all the work that you guys do.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe I introduce myself.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, go ahead, Moses.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so my name is Moses Ojunju.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I live in Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I live just around the Lake Victoria watershed region.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We normally call it the western region of Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I founded a project, a non-profit organization that is called the Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are basically dealing with smaller farmers.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** god.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** beginning We're my

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have a signature training model called the forest farmland agroforestry system, where our farmers do incorporate the growth of their crops and native trees.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are doing this because we also need to restore the soil, a lot of other aspects around it.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, we are increasing the food productivity within their forest farmlands.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have different components around these, where we also train them on how to make compost heaps that they use to replace the fertilizer that they buy from agrovets.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently we have about 1,800 farmers.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We enrolled about 600 recently in the past three months.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we do train them, do follow our visits, and do support them.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll have, I'll have...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The is basically in its very initial stages where we are looking for funding to scale it up and funding to support these farmers in the best way that we can.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have had a one-on-one with Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She visited when she came to Africa.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I also have the Restoring Pillars of Life books that are under, you know, authored.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are trying just to sell it in Kenya and in Africa so that it can also be able to support a bit of our work that we are doing.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so that is me in a nutshell.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I would love my project also to appear in your...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've seen you doing a lot of publications.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I would love our project to appear in whatever you do.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, gladly.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I will look into that.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, hold on.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You probably want to email info at globalearthrepairfoundation.org.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll do it on my own, but be cool if we had some correspondence.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Here, will run your contact information, and that sounds like a really good idea.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'd love to do a feature on you.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I'm actually kind of looking for something.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me write this down.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm just sharing with you my email address, and if you can also share yours in the chat, then I can email you after this call.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I am doing that.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm getting used to using the phone for this, usually on my computer, but I'm trying to save power and all of this.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So bear with me here.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like I'm learning to walk all over again.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they send you this one, it's my email address just set up for my correspondence for this particular stuff.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I have, like, several different identities on the internet, and this is but one.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll send that one.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And click your link just to...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm sending.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've seen it.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Cool.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we'll show you guys some of my stuff really quick here.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Tell us a little bit more about yourself besides the fact that you work for Global Earth Repair.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I am.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm also a regenerative farmer.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, I'm not feeding my rabbits right now.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I developed these.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I have like a few rabbits and chickens, obviously.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm on five acres here.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the rabbits are in this...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I sort of developed these little rabbit tractors.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank Thank

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have an open bottom, or the bottom has a chicken wire on the bottom, so I pull them a little bit every day, like three or four times a day.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they can eat the grass?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly, yeah, but they can't dig.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, they would love to dig, but if they were able to dig, they would dig their way out.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we've got a little brooding box right there, and I just move them along.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I already did the thing for the day, or for now, but yeah, and then I give them a little bit of supplement, supplemental feed.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In the evening, when I go into bed, I do it again, and I give them a little bit to get through the night.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, I'm not doing a lot of veggies yet, but we're trying to restore and rewild this property where the former landlord...

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I got grandfathered through, he would drive his riding mower all over the place constantly.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And since he stopped doing that, he's not the landlord anymore, but he stopped doing that, all the prairies started to come back.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** On the opposite side of the pond, if I go there, I'll lose signal, but we have more acreage over there, and it's getting huge, huge tall grasses and prairie.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And a pond down there, we didn't build the pond, but we're working on making inroads to it so the kids can go enjoy it and swim in the pond and stuff while it's still summertime.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Trying to get some of the brush.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've got a bunch of the alder, and this is a project right now, we're starting to strip down some of the alder and clear brush and strip it down to turn this stuff into waddle and dobs.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So to make some terraces down the mountain or planters or fences, anti-chicken fences and just different stuff.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I live in a couple of tiny homes.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've got a shed and a trailer and a greenhouse that I converted into an outdoor bathroom.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like literally our bathroom and got a composting toilet.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A makeshift Rubbermaid Pond that I fill up and I have an Amazon space heater.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're not entirely on the solar, but we've got some solar and not entirely on the wind, but we've got some wind.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is my life.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Some people are like, why do you live this way?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And some people are like, how can I live this way?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's homesteading though.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's not, uh, it's not a business.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's, um, I'm a carpenter as well.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I sell, um, planter boxes for other people to be able to do similar stuff.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, and, uh, and I'm also, I, I was working toward getting involved in the farmer's market, but I just had a friend that set up a table and she needs product.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to pick some blackberries and herbs and other stuff, um, to, to sell at her table.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Cause I never really had enough farmed goods to really make a table.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, and, uh, so that's, that's happening.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that might be a little bit of profit, um, financial, financial profit like that.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, uh, so there's business aspects.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In my carpentry business, I'd like to say it's more like, um,

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's more like an ecology and landscaping business with the carpentry front, you know?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm secretly or not so secretly trying to teach as many people as I can about these ecological principles and sell them the materials to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's what I'm up to, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's the advantage of being able to walk around with a phone.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can't do that with your computer.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just a little.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've got four kids, and that's most of my energy.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So where are you based?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you currently?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the furthest.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Left part of Washington and the United States.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just below British Columbia, where I'm going to my son.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ah, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The same coast, except the north part is Canada and the south part is the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and I was actually born on Vancouver Island, but came here when I was an infant, but still was drawn back to the area in general because this is just such a beautiful area.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I grew up in Southern California, where it was very dry, parched, and was always pining for trees and orcas and rain and stuff.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, it's really nice.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My son lives on Bowen Island, just off of Vancouver.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to be going there for the next 10 days.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is that on the inside?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's the closest Gulf Island to Vancouver.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's in the archipelago, kind of.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right on.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That landscape of trees and beaches and little towns of very ecologically minded people.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My older brother grew up on Hornby Island, which sounds like a much smaller island in the inside passage there.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it was very similar, very similar vibes.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just a lot of people making it work on a small space.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, very small-scale farming, lots of forests, lots of ocean.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe you need to take a look at an opportunity that is coming, that is going to Idaho, being organized by Masterminding Eden.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that conference needs brands and people like you.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if you would be able to check Masterminding, let me just try it, then I think you can upload them.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have you seen them?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, we were in conversation, I think, with one of the founders there, Aya.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I did look, it looks like a really cool conference.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It is MastermindingEden.com.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Was that Kamara?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Did you have a conversation with Kamara?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kamara Kassim?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I didn't.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I did not.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I talked to Aya.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not sure.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That sounds like somebody's nickname.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if his actual name is Aya.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So who was the contact?

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How do you spell it?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The contact should be Kamara Kassim.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kamara Kassim.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you know how to spell that?

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm just...

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It should be this one.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and we also tend to do different things with EcoRistar.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm also focusing on Africa.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sure if you've been here, you know a lot more that we are trying to do.

**{'display_name': 'MOSES, GFCCA', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I thought today we could have our whole quorum, but it seems a lot of people forgot to put these on their calendars, so they didn't know there was a meeting today.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm only here because I added it to my automatic reminder, so I set them every two weeks, and I've been keep rolling it over and meaning to join, and I finally did, and nobody's here.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's fine.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I enjoyed meeting you two a little bit more and hearing more about what you do.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll try to make the next one.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm trying to get up earlier.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know I'm a farmer, but I'm a bad farmer in that respect.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I start late.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm a night owl.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I love the night, and I like to build things when the hour is drawing thin, and when there's not a lot happening.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nobody talks to me.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that can play.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, exactly.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because bless their heart, they always have good things to say and come to me with brilliant ideas and stuff.

**{'display_name': 'ORQAS', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it's hard to juggle so many balls at once.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'm just trying to send a link for those who don't have it in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So we're still in the pre-meeting warm-up stage.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so I'm joining for a certain organization, which I used to go and join some meetings, then I would go back.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I saw that you had some government officials visiting you recently.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I had the chief of staff of Uganda Air Force.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They came with a delegation of 25 military officers.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They visited the Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, we had a good talk.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I also met the Belgium Ambassador to Uganda and the director for Ghent University yesterday.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are trying to, the other, the other program which we were intending to, to host the 20 interns, yesterday we were hosted at the Ambassador's Residence in Kampala.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll share with you the details.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think, Edward, I think the agenda of today, I think we, I wish we can use this meeting to, to update each other.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** what we are doing, and the plan is, I think maybe, the question is to update us, maybe, what are you doing with Edward's Hamlets, what are the plans for the future, and, yeah, anything related to LR, especially Africa, if you can share that, and we, we give the flow to each other, so.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You mean, I'm the one to begin, or?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, because it's just, you already started.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you reading out of the agenda, or?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly, exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know you are reading out of the whole agenda for today.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think, yeah, the agenda is just sharing the work we are doing, like what you are doing with Edward Hamritz, and what are the future plans, and and, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You're on mute now.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think, basically, you know all that is going around at the Hamlet?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's, we are strengthening the capacity of the Hamlet, to deliver on its objectives and goals.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Which, right now, we are trying to ...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** look ...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** look for more partners.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry, want to block first.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I want to block off them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, basically, we are building this, our local base, by looking for more partners, as you very well know, most of our activities are to deliver on the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Article 4, creating awareness, capacity building, research, and education.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And with the education, I think, basically, know that we are focusing on regenerative agriculture, which encompasses nature-based solutions, cover groups, minimum ...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Village, mulching, and water conservation.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, as you know that we are just in the long-term transition, and being that even the UN can cry over the funds to deliver on its goals, we are also trying to look for more partners to widen our resource base so that we can have the capacity to deliver.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The biggest problem is how do we strengthen, how do we deliver?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So this week, we had engagements with the government, the military, the Ugandai People's Defense Force.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No, you broke up.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Which is, it's developing a poor environmental

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they've been trying to visit potential stakeholders on the ground, and the hamlet having, in the past, in the past, donation fruit trees to the military, to the security barracks, we did that because we knew that they are so they protect the environment.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you give them the trees, if you give them the trees, they can always conserve and protect them.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we had that engagement with the Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Gonyi of the Uganda Air Force.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also we had the engagement with the Royal Guards because they are trying to, they have a zero draft on their policy for the Ministry of Defence, we had zero

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We engagement with the CodeAid Netherlands, we are trying to look for ways of partnering, be it material, moral, and financial support, and also we had an engagement with the Belgium Ambassador and the Rector, Vice-Rector for Ghent University, who is on a visit left, they are leaving today, the delegation back to Belgium, having spent here one week, and all having said so, we are in the hunt to have as many potential partners as possible, so that we can walk the talk, and we can deliver, as you very well know after you said pulling out the donors team, many countries also have paid a blind eye on funding projects, so now we are just trying to look for partners.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And ...

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are also working with the CFF, it's a climate and environment platform in Israel, working with the UN, with Goodwill Ambassador Damoran, who is going to present on the Hamlet during the Climate Week in New York, and we've been also working on a video, five-minute video with Elisa, so that she can present as well practices, on the grassroots, so they decided, picked the Hamlet, as a living example, and they are going to present at the COP30 in Brazil.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So having said so, we are still going to, in the drive to look for funds, put infrastructure in place, because there is a conference next year, it's going to attract 25 international participants globally, and they propose that it's going to be held at the Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are happy to be associated with that.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very much.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, that's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think I...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, Jon, you can go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You can just comment or ask.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** was just going to say, that's an awful lot, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Congratulations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm going to be in New York for Climate Week, and I would love to meet with your Israeli collaborator and to go to that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Talk, and if you or he have ideas about how we can be helpful, you know, we're always interested in helping.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, it's Sol.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's talking about Sol, I would imagine.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And at what event?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Do you know?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's going to talk at the UN once or twice, but then during Climate Week.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also in, she's hoping to get...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** To Brazil.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** don't know if that's going to happen or not.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Cool.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So maybe, thanks, Edward, for sharing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's, it seems like a good plan and, yeah, amazing what you are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe we can give the flow to Leonce.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Tell us what is going on within your life, what you are doing for nature and with your organization and what are the plans for the future.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We cannot hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was saying that I'm very happy to be here now in this meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As many of you, you know that I'm here in Uganda, with refugees, but I'm still organizing my community in Congo, because now there is some, some, what can I say, it's not peace, but it is like a example of peace.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** People can now go to their land and do something.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now I'm contacting them, especially those who are in the country, and a program of eco-economy and the agro.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, I'm organizing them now to begin some activities according to that program, and there is, I'm identifying some who has their plans, they need to begin with agroecology now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are going to put, to implement some projects, they are built, and I think I will share with everybody what the activity we are going to begin in this October, because our season of agriculture is going to begin on September.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And in October they begin to plant, to begin the season of agriculture, so we plan to see those who need to get some seeds, and those who are ready to begin with agroecology in their coffee fields.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Are you talking about supporting planting in Congo, or planting where you are now?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** My question is, will these plantings be in Congo, or where you're currently located?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The location is in Congo, in Minova.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Got it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So you're not there, but life goes on and you're continuing to support your people.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, come again.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I said life goes on.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, what I'm doing with that technology there, what I do every time, I try to explain them in our network with Save the Planet, that in spite of the war, we cannot stop walking because maybe the war will pass.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we will stay and we must do something.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe it will contribute to result, to bring solution to this world, which is unjust, which is not just for what people are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think I will share the database of all agricultures who I'm working now with them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think in our future meeting, I will share their database.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, Leonce.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's great and very sweet to hear that you are even doing work while you are out of the country.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you for dedication.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can see we have Nyansio here.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He has been joining us, but...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But really always the internet restricts him to say anything.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Bjamukama, can you hear me?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, he's from Uganda, but I don't know if he can hear us.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hey, Bjamukama, are you here?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, if not, we can give the flow to Mtokani.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll put the question that we are answering in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, hello once again for everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, it's a privilege to be meeting again since we have met last time for our first meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And this is our second meeting of this month as we are going to end up the month.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I really appreciate what my colleagues

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Rick, especially Edward, what he shared about the project and the work he is doing in Uganda, he is very amazed, as we aim on focusing on regenerative agriculture, is something which we are looking out to bring the food solution mostly in our country, like Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, what I can say, and what we are doing here in Kakuma refugee camp, as all we know, the climate of the Kakuma, Kakuma is the area with the dry season, normally receive rain, but not a while, so sometimes we receive rain for once a time, but now currently we are having some little rain, so even though we don't have much season of rain season in Kakuma, Kakuma because our climate normally change, so we can't predict which month we receive rain and which month we cannot receive rain.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So any time we can decide to rain, so Kakuma can receive rain.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So as we don't have enough rain in Kakuma, so what normally do sometimes, we normally do water, hot harvest, so to assist us for irrigation, to assist us in irrigation, because Kakuma is a dry land and it is very hot, so to keep water you need to have some harvest, enough harvest material for it to harvest water.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So as our team, I and my team, we were doing some very amazing work, so even though it is somehow challenges how to harvest water, but we are trying to make up and come up with some solutions we can do.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So like currently now, we have decided to dig a hole where we be using a water pump to pump water for us to enable us to do some irrigation for our crops.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** say Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Tell

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So as we normally use, we normally plant some kale, some spinach, and other traditional food which is okra, so other food which we normally do as the water, according to the water beneficiary we have in the kalkuma that we normally rely on.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, and in our future, now, and we are planning to have a workshop by October, if God willing, so we are planning to have a workshop and a campaign on how to, where we can educate our local refugee in Kakuma, the importance of agriculture, and how agriculture can make us sustain.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in this season, which we are having now, we have the shortage of food in Kakuma, so maybe the agriculture can make us, and can reduce some, some effect of our shortage of food, instead of the people.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to go and protest against the UNCR or against the government, so, but if we can depend and if we can change the kakuma, even though it is dry, so, and if we can put all our effort to change the kakuma, so that can make her to sustain, even though we don't have enough support, but we can try with our effort, so, to make our life change in kakuma.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, we are planning to have that campaign in October, so, where we can go to more youth and treat mothers, even, and even some local authority which can support us, so, to run that campaign and awareness.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Yes, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I have a question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's, it's, as usual, it's inspirational work.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** in, in our conversations with people from Nakavali, we've,

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We've understood that the camp commandant is an important figure that can either advance or stand in the way of doing the kinds of things we're doing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Can you tell us a little bit about the governance and support you have from the people who run the camp at Kakuma?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you can come up with a question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I don't get it clear.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** My question is, how are your relationships with the people who manage the camp government?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So currently, as we are still a small team, so we are...

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Looking a way forward where we can engage with the local government.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the only the local government which we normally collaborate with is the one who takes charge for the refugee in Kakuma, which is called the Department of Refugee Secretariat, which is the government authority, but the big government authority currently we don't have any relationship with them, but we have the local government which we have in refugee which normally take the control of of all the refugees, so which only the normal people we collaborate with.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, anyone else has a question.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mtokani, that's great initiatives and plans.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, it's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Seems like I didn't even know you before.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, people are doing amazing work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, jump camera.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you see his back?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, hello.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Mr.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Lola.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, go on.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Ovidja Mukama Nyansio, from one of the villages starting the building of the National Park, mainly in the southern sector, which is in Nkuri Ingo, that is formed in the southern district in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very happy to be here, because I have been trying to do anything.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It would have been a problem for so long.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Even today, I just took a lot of minutes to try to connect it, but today I'm very lucky, I tried to join, and I'm ready with you here.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I'm a youth farmer at Gwindi EcoFarm, and I'm working with different people, mainly the youth, women and the orphans.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** With the women, do skills like tailoring, basket weaving, shoemaking, and wood carving.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I work with the women and youth in that activity.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, with the children, we do weekend programs for the homeless and vulnerable children.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, we also do.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, do.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** do.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Food programs, where possible.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, I also try to provide some scholastic materials, where possible.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I also work with the community, mostly those people who are living near the impenetrable national park.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What do we do?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mostly, I do encourage people, mostly those living near the river Chidina.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** River Chidina is a river that starts from the community, then it takes the water to be in the national park.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, here, I always try to encourage people living near that river, to try by all means and not spoil the water.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because...

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because...

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sometimes they use it to spray the river with the plastic products of which are at risk of affecting the mountain gorillas and other creatures, and of which we people who are living in the nearby penetrable national park, we are 100% benefiting or our life is mostly depending on the mountain gorillas.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Why?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It always receives some tourists from different parts of the world, and when they come and pass through our communities, we sell our baskets, sell our plants, and even if possible, they just always stay in the lodges within the community, and there is some smaller percent that goes to support the community.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, back to the community.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, back to

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, sir, Mr.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kamma, again?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What is the park?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kamma, Kamma, The park is called the Bwindi International Park.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That should be Bwindi in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, I just left on Bwindi in Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, he's doing amazing work with women.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think Yeah, a調整

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ready for change.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think they are doing a project together.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So please come in our meetings next time if you can.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know it's really hard always for you to get internet, but we are so glad to have you today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The connection between agriculture and the river and the mountain gorillas is a good story.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'd like to know more about that and about how you make those connections real to the people there.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon Schull, do you want to say anything about that?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How do you connect, how do you connect agriculture, mountain gorillas and the river you said?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Aha, you see, agriculture, it is part of

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Conservation Mostres at Modern Agriculture, which includes planting of trees, then the food we grow in the community, we always just take it to the rogers, or it is just mostly used by the rogers, of which even the tourists from outside, they always use.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, as the tourists, when they are coming for the mountain gorillas, they also come in the community, like at Bindi EcoFarm, we do local food experience, where they taste the local food, then from there, the relationship between maybe agriculture and the forest, You see, like that river Chijina, it just starts from the community.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, poor nested is all farming, has been affecting the villages from the city.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The mountain gorillas due to spoil of water that starts from the community's end of the forest, and if there is no worker dying, or if there is no action, I think the mountain gorillas are even going to die or just get some diseases, because the mountain gorillas also use that water, so good methods of farming.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good methods of farming are helping to clean the water, mostly planting of trees on river Thaides, that when they plant trees, it filterates the water, which could be detonated, and maybe that one has even reduced the landslides, of which I think think think You Thank

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That landslide has been also destroying the community's land, where you could find the soils that are going to the forest, of which you could not use it again.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But when we protect our land, we also protect the forest and its living creatures.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And which village are you in?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm in a village called the Kikomo Village.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I operate in a village called the Muroli, which is exactly touching the wind impenetrable national park, including the town council.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Any other questions to him?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, if no, maybe before we close the check-in from Africa, maybe I can go and then we...

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm working with Climate Smart Solutions, and we are based in Tanzania, in Russia, and I'm director of that local angel, and we are focusing in four areas.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sustainable agriculture, forest, and biodiversity conservation, but also we are looking on water management, and lastly, we are looking on the carbon climate, community carbon credit financing.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And now, as reporting, we have now the project on water management, and it is about...

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oti Water Vesting, and for us as Climate Smart Solutions, we are just restoring the degraded areas where we are implementing the project.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the project is one and a half year, means it is about 15, 18 months of implementation, and it is funded by Viva Conagua.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Viva Conagua is in German.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are just covering about, it is one village, but it is almost 3,600 peoples with almost 450 households.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we are working with the school.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Schools, two schools, as well as one of a center in the village.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the issue here is to impart the knowledge, especially for these young kids in issues of restoration and the issue of wash.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we started last month, and we are just building the school clubs, which we named the wash clubs for schools.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And now the next coming weeks, will be doing some trainings, especially for these kids.

**{'display_name': 'George', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's my update from my side, and you are welcome, and I appreciate what you are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, we are creating a project called Green Campus, where we can partner with other organizations to at least provide...

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Solar panels and solar grids, yeah, grids, solar grids to deprived educational centers in the rural areas, and sometimes even in the urban area, because we have the government schools who don't have electricity, they are struggling with the cost of electricity, but we are looking at that angle to see whether we can create mini grids, grids, so that we can provide them with solar energy, solar power, so that it will be easier for them to have access to renewable energy, which is very cheap than the orthodox or traditional energy that we have been using.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are working on a lot of projects, yeah, and I'm also into a lot of organizations doing other work on climate change.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In Accra.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Got it.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, in the Gansout area.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, Gansout area.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was great.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think now I can use like three minutes then to give you my updates.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So personally, I've been doing some works and I'm planning to do some other work.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the updates from my side is that, yeah, first I want to say that we, tomorrow, actually tomorrow, will be traveling to Africa Food System Forum.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We'll be in Senegal and I will be able to participate in that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But personally, my mission will be basically like two of them.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is personal communication, but also, I don't know, maybe I will talk with communication.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** communication.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** team on how we can use this opportunity, especially giving updates on how the event is going or some takeover on Instagram.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I personally be able to connect with actors in the food system and some organizations like Agra and MasterCard, I think, which are playing killer in organizing this conference.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the other upcoming thing that I will do is that I will also be participating, I got support from an organization called Global Landscape Forum, I will participate in the World Agroforestry Congress, that will be in Rwanda, and yesterday I got lucky that my abstract, I submitted abstract, and it got accepted.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will be presenting about my agroforestry project that I'm doing here in Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And how that one can shift the grassroots economy and with resilience of our communities and the farmers in my community, in my village.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will be happy to present that.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And within that week also I will be participating in African Youth Biodiversity Forum.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It seems like I'm lucky enough I'm going to connect with different prayers and people and organizations in these sectors.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And lastly, I'm lucky enough again, I will be doing a project in October with MP.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope Ananda knows, and thanks Ananda for connecting me with MP.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We discussed and we are going to do a project together in Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, she is going to travel to Rwanda in October.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The project we are going to do is, actually because Higari's dream is to be a green city, and the project we will be doing is implementing some food forestry in primary schools, and we are going to start with two schools where we'll be establishing nurseries and some food forestry, but also the main focus is to support the kitchen gardens in each primary school, where we want to engage children and kids in primary schools to teach them how to produce food, how to plant seeds, because my dream was just to do that in Higari, the capital city where most of the kids are, has no access to nature, and doesn't have any kind of knowledge about food systems and how to grow some seeds, So...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The intention is to teach them and engage them and establish these things for them to be able to do practices and grow with these mindsets and skills.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, I think those are the main things that I will be doing as part of my engagement with nature, ecosystem, and restoration, and climate change and actions.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe I can give the photo to Ananda, Jon, and then Luz to give us some comments or whatever, sharing what they are doing as well.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, Ananda, let's.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I yield to Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I just learned that Ananda is going to Rwanda in October.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, no, not me.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, man.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's all.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, it's not Ananda, it's MP, Marie-Pierre, the one who trained us.-huh.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Went with me to Uganda, and she got the Africa bug.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and also, yeah, she planned also to go to Uganda to Mubende.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we'll go together as well, because they have a project with, uh, three-pound, the, um, Mohanji, Gusinga Mohanji.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I think probably we're gonna travel to Uganda together, and, um, bridge these kind of, uh, networks and collaboration.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great to know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonard, um, you know, I'm, I'm very happy to be a part of these discussions, and I'm very encouraged by all of the work everyone is doing, and any connections we can help make.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But Leonard, you ought to be able to help us find the right people at AGRA and MasterCard to talk to.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We would like to figure out, I hear all of these really good projects, and we would like to be able to support them better.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I think we might be able to do that by acting as a conduit with MasterCard, who might want to interact with an organization like the ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** We're still trying to figure out what our role is, and part of it is participating in these conversations, and part of participating in the conversations is figuring out how we can be more effective.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think all of the reports show that important work is happening on the ground.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I wish we were doing more supportive.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'd like to figure out how.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think it's going to be easy.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm positive because the guy from AGRA...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like the guy who is from Agra, mainly he's a leader of climate change and adaptation, and this guy we met in Rwanda, and then he's the one who invited me, just surprisingly, and it seems like he becomes my friend, so then when we meet, it would be a good start to then discuss on how I can connect you and talk.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm positive, but also I'm trying to see if I can meet.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A person from MasterCard, which is a key organization that is behind all these staffs.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm hopeful that I will be able to do so.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, Leonard, you might send me information about this conference in Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, that I did not go on the last trip that Ananda went on, and I'm noticing that as I hear that there are other people who are going to be there at a particular time,

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** When in a particular place, I start thinking maybe I should, you know, I should make good on my promise to Edward and others to get into the region.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So send me information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'll, I'll consider it.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes, please.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** will do.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ananda?

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't have much to add.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, except that in a couple of weeks, Edward and I are both going to be participating at a conference in Ontario on global shocks.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're going to be speaking about food systems, ecology, and regeneration.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of Agriculture, a conference that's organized by Ronald Rabai, who is a Ugandan, who's living in Ontario right now.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I see Les is not here now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyone who has a question?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Comment on what we all discussed?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or requests?

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think, for me, I was thinking maybe in the future, we can do, maybe I can help with that, maybe doing mapping of these kind of regional, international conferences that are happening, so that people can be aware on how...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what level of interactions or participation that can have.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that would be helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know what people think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think that would be great, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will start something, because I know even there is a World Food Forum that is happening in Italy in October as well, and so many others.

**{'display_name': 'Byamukama nyansio', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, one of the things that we've been talking about is speakers through ERA, like when there's conferences happening, if we have ERA members that can get to them or represent the viewpoint that ERA represents at those types of conferences, that would certainly be important.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, if we can...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Play a greater role in identifying people that would be able to, that are close to those areas where the conferences are being held and would be in a position to speak.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think that would be amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And in whatever I participate, I think I will be carrying the flag of EcoRestoration Alliance, and especially for the Africa focus.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's my dream, because I feel like we can bring many partners, especially from Africa, as Jon say.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then it's a good way when you go to the conference to represent these kind of big movements and let people know it is there and it's doing something.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Please don't cry because they say no.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Agreed.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Leonce has his hands up.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, Leonce.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, Leonce, can you...

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We cannot hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** my ear.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or I can write in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No, we can hear you.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Ah, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was saying that I see we have touched everything, everybody gives what he's doing, and I wanted to say if...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How we can produce, like, headlines...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of what people are doing, and share it with ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's my first proposition.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The second proposition is, we usually say about regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Ananda, he remember that when we did it at Edward Hamlet, I saw that many communities didn't understand exactly what is the regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So my proposition was this, is it possible to ERA, to organize in those communities, different members of ERA, to organize the training as we did here in Jinja, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is it possible ERA to organize this too?

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The so that people can get the program and know what is the generative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's something that the ERA Africa group could focus on.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have many, many, many members who are working with raising awareness about regenerative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It would be great to have a more focused coordination of that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It's a good idea, Leonce, and in the last six months, we've met a number of people, some of them on this call, some of them in previous calls, who are themselves experts at this kind of thing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If If If If If If If If If If

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I would be interested in trying to figure out how to organize that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Flying ourselves out there, I mean, frankly, it would be nice.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And once we were there, we would love to speak.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But there is a lot of African talent and understanding available.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If you can organize the conferences, then it's just a matter of transporting the speakers from one region to another.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That might be a relatively inexpensive proposition that we could get support for.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** It a lot cheaper, I would imagine, to move people from Kampala to Jinja, for example, than to move people from North America to Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And we could provide supporting information.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So that might be an efficient way of trying to get this started.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** If you have a particular schedule or format in mind or you'd like to try to organize, you know, give us a sketch of a first such event as a test, I'd be very interested in thinking about it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You understand our problem is that we also do not have a lot of money, but we believe that we have access to people and ideas in Africa and around the world that ought to be helpful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So if you can figure out a way in which we can use a small amount of money to organize what's becoming a large community, that would be great.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we're also through the master classes, we're starting to accumulate some recordings of talks, which could be compiled and used as starting points for, you know, showing us, showing us.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A video conference with different people presenting and then using that as a starting point for discussions with experts that are, you know, close by in the area that could get there easily enough.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** That's a great idea, because while it's expensive to ship Ananda from Toronto to Uganda, it's very cheap to send a recording of her, and she could be present for a question and answer session after the presentation.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Over the Zoom.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm wondering what the technical barriers to that are.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Does Edward have a large-ish screen and internet connection that could support that kind of an event?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Or maybe a large-

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** The screen would be a bit of hardware that we would move from place to place if we could organize that kind of thing.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We don't have such larger screen and especially then that we are living off grid.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But those are among the issues that I'm addressing in one of my partnership drive to look at the embassies and other goodwill wishes.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There is this big screen that which we could use.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** got a donation from Eliza of a projector, small projector, which can use solar.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But no, we don't have.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we are looking towards that because we are going to be involving in international virtual meetings.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's among our priorities as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** You know, Edward, I'm going to.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I introduce you to Peter Odama in Uganda, I learned just this week that he's doing some regenerative in Kampala, he's doing some regenerative work, but he also is serving as a sales agent for a company that makes smart boards.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** And I would like you two to get together, you must get to Kampala every so often, do you not?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was in Kampala yesterday at the embassy, I'm always in Kampala.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There we go.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But not every time, but I go on purpose.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I understand.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Then I will write a letter to introduce you two to each other.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** think you're both among our most established and sophisticated partners, and I'd like you to know each other.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Very good.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I think this meeting is coming to a close.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, sure.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And thank you, everyone, for the presentation and interaction.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** was amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, yes, Hashim.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, I raised my hand.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I saw that nobody's seen my hand, so that I've lowered my hand.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but I'm trying to make a suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know whether I, because I'm new in ERA, although I've been here for some time, but I'm new.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know whether they encourage ecuatorism because we can, because sometimes those conferences, it's not about the conferences, about people who are looking for funding.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Funding is one aspect of it, to attend the conferences.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you don't get funding, you just, you cannot attend it easily.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You have to raise your own.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I want to do that.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** most of the people who are NGOs, they are working as volunteers and they don't have money.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if we can put up a local tourism system so that we can do some capacity building and school training on it, I think to help us along so that we will use that opportunity or that medium so that we can be going around, not even in Europe or in Africa as tourists, we can attract tourists from other places to come and see whatever is going on in terms of agreed businesses and regional practices and those kind of systems that are going on in the villages and other regions.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's my suggestion.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But maybe if somebody to ask something to say.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think it will help us a lot, and yes, that we can use that medium to raise some funds and help each other to go around.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think it will be a good thing.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Good point, Ashim.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, that's true.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And also, I think in the past, we talked about something like that, where we were discussing on how we can start breeding the capacities of our members, or members on maybe having micro grants to support these kind of initiatives that are businesses in terms of helping people make some revenues from conservation work that we are doing.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think maybe we can keep this discussion and, yeah, and make it alive.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Agreed.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it's time to say bye.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then I will do follow up.

**{'display_name': 'Leonard, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will send you the email, Jon, and I will update the others on what we discussed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Thanks, everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Here come the note takers.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sorry?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I said, here come the note takers.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, sorry, note takers.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sounds like Ananda's chuckle.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're laughing because of all the note takers and the dearth of humans, right?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly, exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Looks like we've got four humans and we're definitely...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Definitely.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's by the note takers.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yet it's only 12.01, so there's still hope for humanity.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, we work on Africa time here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** impressive.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, was.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I saw you holding a plaque.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Were you given an award as well as Edward, or were you just there presenting it to Edward?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I was given an award as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what was your award?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, they were all kind of contributions toward planetary health.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We should have a virtual trophy shelf.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Congratulations for your award.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are there so many people received that award, or...?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, a lot of people did.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Daniel.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you, Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Fine, fine.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you also attended a big conference, Leonard?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was a big one, very big one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, yeah, you've seen those about African Food System Forum, and so many ministers, presidents, high level people from Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But what I really loved the most is it was like it was dedicated to young people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe because it hosted by the government.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The Senegal and the president himself is still a young person.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the theme was really dedicated to young people as the power of collaboration, innovation toward sustainable food systems.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it was amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I tried to go to many sections, exhibitions, and there were so many international people as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, I got a chance to meet some people from different organizations like Agra.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Agra was the main one, mainly the host by the country, but Agra was like the main founder of the conference through a partnership with MasterCard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's always behind these big organizations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I got a chance to interact with people from MasterCard, one person from MasterCard, actually two, and the other one from Agra, who is always my friend, and I talked about EcoRestoration Alliance, and yeah, maybe I was about to update this to Jon, but he was, the one from Agra was interested to have a conversation with us, and the other one from MasterCard shared the email, but this one is based in Nagana, but in Senegal, but we can dive in and meet with these big, big people from MasterCard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will just do follow-up soon, but it was amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where was the conference held?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Senegal.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, it was in Senegal.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is that Mara?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is she there?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You are muted.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm so sorry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I thought I had a medical engagement yesterday, so I couldn't come to Brompton, but I'm glad to see you're all there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are Edward and Mara?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where are you meeting now?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are in Mississauga in Brompton, too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I just drove in, but this morning, I don't know, did you share the picture yet?

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I shared it with I was able to meet with some students at a high school, all girls high

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** School, who are going to be working with Edward Tamlin on a project.

**{'display_name': 'Edward Paul Munaaba', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I got to start my morning there and then come over, which has been fabulous.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Great.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, maybe we were just talking informally, but we would like maybe to give some time to Ananda and Edward to tell us the overview.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** of their conference, the conference they attend.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just to share the experience, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, the theme of the conference was, I mean, the original concept of it was global shocks, specifically COVID-19, but that's expanded to include all.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All topics that can affect the whole global system, so they touch on issues of health, they touch on issues of trade and supply chains, they touch on environment and climate change, so Edward and I were in the section addressing that.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the organizers are all Africans living in the diaspora, so a lot of them in the Toronto area, and then the people that attend the conference, it's a curious phenomenon, but it's a lot of delegates from African countries, there were quite a few representatives from Uganda,

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** From Kenya, from Tanzania, there was a whole delegation of an organization called IGAD, which is a regroupment of East African countries, and there was a few people from Nigeria, there was from Somalia, from Senegal, so yeah, it's a curious phenomenon.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A whole, an African meeting that takes place in Canada, and many people in groups are from the African diaspora, so it really is intended to create links between Africans who are living on this side of the world, but still deeply invested and have connections in Africa.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How many people would you say, total?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There wasn't as many people as they would have liked to have.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't know what the total, like, maybe 100.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** What would you say, Edward?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How many people do you think were there?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** 100, 150?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think in total it was around 150.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was the first missions in Canada from several countries, from Mongolia, Zambit, from Kenya, from Uganda, high commissioners and ambassadors and consulates as well, plus civil society.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, there was a professor from

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Makarari University, if we ever want to organize, try again to organize something there, we have an in.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that's interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** mean, for me, the question always becomes, how do we fit in to this?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, we make connections.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have people like Ananda and Mara, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Were there other ERA people at the meeting?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, I mean, so do you have any thoughts about how we can contribute to this effort or play a role?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's interesting with the, you know, there's a high level of the delegates that come, like the people that spend the money to, to come to...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I like these connections.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So a lot of ambassadors and people in more influential places.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that there's quite a lot of openness to our message.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, it's probably easier to get agreement with African leaders than with North American leaders.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's interesting.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think just because the, yeah, the culture, people are still more connected to nature and they understand the importance of nature and the connection and the importance of agriculture and food security.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, that's an important observation, I guess.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they probably also recognize it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have, they've got a great deal of a really valuable asset in terms of the nature and the natural resources that they have there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if they are receptive, are they able to do what needs to be done?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, I mean, I think that there's potential.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, I don't see a direct pathway yet, but just in making these connections and being able to create these connections, if we have a proposal.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I mean, not, yeah, just to, if we have something to propose, if we have something concrete to propose, I think that there's like more kind of based understanding of the necessity for it than we might find.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** In some, like, North American political and university circles.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And to whom would we be proposing?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'll point out that Edward and Mara both have things to propose.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Is there a mechanism for proposing and getting support in this community, or is that a separate process?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, it's a network thing, you know?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's like you meet a network thing, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a network thing.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** mean, maybe there's individuals that we've met.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** don't see all the links at this point, but...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, Edward and Mara, I'd be interested in your analysis of this situation and the roles that we are or might be playing.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you want me to share?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I mean, I haven't engaged in a while.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been very busy.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So a lot of this relates.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My work in Nigeria continues.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that's blossoming.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But my Fulbright will be happening.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know I had hoped to go this past summer, but it will be happening in May.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will be hosted by Sequoia Agriculture University in Tanzania.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And part of my work will be to host a experiential learning institute and symposium.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And they would like to open that up at my encouragement to an international audience.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will be meeting with them.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will be meeting with their faculty.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been working with one faculty member, but I'll be meeting with

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That more broadly.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that opens up some opportunities.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The project with Nardin Academy is important because I'm working with Edward to help with the experiential learning center of things.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we've talked about the Regeneration Hamlet having the work and then having a center that would sort of help drive the work, both in terms of revenue generation, but also outreach and sharing the work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So Nardin Academy is an important first step because it's the first school that we're partnering with.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a school where I was a trustee and my kids have gone there and I already established this global project challenge.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This will be the second year.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Just met with the girls.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they are going to be working on developing educational materials.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Kits, if you will.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We don't know what that means yet.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's ambiguous enough that we can all work on it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But the idea will be that they will be engaging with Edward remotely, virtually, and learning about the work and helping to share the work with the goal of building a foundation for study abroad for, you know, for both in-person and virtual engagement.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Part of the work that we're going to be doing today together is really developing a model for the Experiential Learning Center.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see three levers that I would love engagement around.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One would be a speaker series that you could all participate in, where a part of the money would go back, right, to the work, and we could build that out digitally.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The second would be the educational resources and materials and stories that will come out of this that are of value.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, to educational programs, including Nigeria, because now they have that curriculum for project-based learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, and then the third would be, um, would be engagement, um, coming, those who want to come to the site to participate in projects or those who want to engage through virtual projects.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I really am advocating for a revenue generation model that, um, would, would build out the experiential learning part.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then grants and everything else could come from that.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So using my model, Pearl, and we could talk about digital badges.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, but I see, you know, Narden is really helping to put that in motion.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They are so excited.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, I met with the girls.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think you saw the picture.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Um, one turns out, is doing beekeeping with her father.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So she's sort of excited to focus on beekeeping and she's very curious to see if it's

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Similar to the beekeeping that she does, and I don't think that it is, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is interested in biochar.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's a science person.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Another one is interested in, you know, the food forests or the perma gardens.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But you can see it already.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can already see it moving.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the teacher has her PhD and is interested in women's issues and gender equality.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm super excited, you know, to spend some time with Edward today to put this into motion.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I would say all of this is a model.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There are some grants.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have a contact at National Geographic Foundation.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I reached out to him.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's an active grant around education practices.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There's another one around the actual restorative agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can't submit grants through my university.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** John understands this because it's just so crazy, but I can partner on them.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So if ERA could submit the grant because they're U.S.-based grants, right there, there are some opportunities.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So sorry I haven't been engaged, but I've been very busy, and I'm back, and I think there's tremendous opportunity.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, you're doing...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And indeed, she has almost preempted what we are going to discuss, and I think that we were part of the discussion, so it will be part of continuing what we are going to Oh, the workbook, too.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have a workbook, And we have a workbook, which we are going to develop, covering all the decks in the, what, in the, on the Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm happy that she already has a draft, and at this time, we can't share it out with you because it's still internal.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But let's...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We will be letting it out to you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Going back to one question which Sean was put forward about the significance of the conference, I think it was a very good ground for pollinating, mean, trying to look for partnerships for the ERA and our organizations at large, because one, we met also some guys from IBM.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They've got a foundation as well, and they were interested.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was good that we sat on the same panel with Ananda, and incidentally, I was almost the last, and it captured the whole group, I mean, the whole participants.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what she presented was, in fact, summed up all what we had sat for this, for the two days, deliberated room, and we had ask.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Correct.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So a it

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** A tangible example, which is on the ground, in small, I mean, on a, because the others were just talking, talking, but now we give the real actions on the ground, you know, small actions with great impact globally.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I think after that, I've been invited to give some speech to several symposiums here, after our, our Tuesday delivery, I mean, presentations, I think I sent some copy to Ananda, sent a copy to John, so I have around three invitations to attend around here in Ontario.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's fantastic.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, still, sorry, as, as Mara said, it's now, the board is set to, yeah, we move.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** From the talking and we go to action.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We walk the talk.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The grant is open for National Geographic and it is soon coming to what?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's soon coming to an end.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** think the deadline might be very near.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the agriculture one is for specific crops.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'll send that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That one's due the end of September.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The education one, which is a really that they probably both are, I think is the end of October.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll share those in the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, please.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, this is a priority for us.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'd wanted to give this because I didn't cover it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** thought it would come at a later stage, but let me put it across first.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are presenting the, I think Jon Schull is going to attend the Climate Week in New York on the 18th.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there is a five minutes video, which has been...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's being edited, which is going to be presented by Moran, the UN Climate Goodwill Ambassador.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** She's going to- Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I think you know her from Israel.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So she's going to present it in New York.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as well, she's going to present the same five minutes documentary in the COP30 in Brasen, Edward's Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think that in preparation for the COP30 in Edward's Hamlet next year, we are going to bring around 25 youth groups globally to the Hamlet for nine days to deliberate on issues and also discuss issues related to climate change.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That sounds like real progress, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Congratulations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I wanted to say, by all means, give us those grant links.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But Mara, I can say that we are almost certainly delighted to partner with you in submitting those grants.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It will also be the case that you're going to need to take the lead in creating those grants.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But as you can imagine, we'll be eager to add value as we can.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you mentioned a few things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** This is probably hopeless, but I'm always struggling to keep track of the moving parts.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You mentioned Norton.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know what that is.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You mentioned the Academy, and you mentioned the Center as just.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and mentioned the Academy,

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I from Edwards Hamlet, so maybe you can just remind us what the entities at play are.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, so Narden Academy is an all-girls school.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** happens to be a Catholic school, but it's an independent school in Buffalo, New York, which is where I live and work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I started last year a collaboration where they focus on a global innovation challenge, and they get partnered with one of my partners, and they do a project throughout the year, and I connect them.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's very much in the work that I was doing before.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And so I partnered them with Edwards Hamlet in talking to Edwards and understanding that he wanted to start Experiential Learning Center as another sort of engine or, you know.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Of the Hamlet, I've been working with him on that model.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The two very much go together, but it takes some different planning, right, in terms of thinking through that work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And that's what I had shared with you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's how I see it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The last thing you asked me about was an academy.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in my own work, which focuses on project-based learning connected to the Sustainable Development Goals and connected to local sustainability organizations, that's my model, I work with education institutions, tertiary, higher education, basic education, doesn't matter, to help them create space for this approach in the curriculum.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's one facet.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I also work with youth directly.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll be speaking to a group in Nigeria.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I do a lot of youth mentoring for change.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Agents who want to use this model for their own work.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then I work with the partners to connect them in.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I create the ecosystem so that there are spaces for this.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can connect with the experts and the people who are doing it and we can engage the young people.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the Fulbright that I'm doing is based on my work in Nigeria and it involves an experiential learning institute where I train educators in the model because there's no precedent for it, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody wants skills-based learning in Africa right now.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Everybody, you know, all the states and countries are adopting it, but there's no model and there's no precedent.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I start by engaging teachers directly for a three-day institute, bringing in projects with partners as the focus.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we open it up as an institute, as a symposium.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we can bring in stakeholders and start building that ecosystem.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's what I've been doing in Nigeria, but now I can translate it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I guess the significance is that as you bring in stakeholders or engage in ANDA with the ambassadors, the workforce people, the industry, all of those can come together around these centers for experiential learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nigeria is doing theirs through their state education partners, their higher ed partners, because they're also mandated to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it can happen with the sustainability partners.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can create centers through the partners and then make those connections to education.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It doesn't matter.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, it can happen in any direction.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And we now have the models and we've got data.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Cool.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm so excited to work with Edward because as I...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Work with Sequoia University or, you know, you know, any of the universities that want to start, you know, universities are slower, education slower, but we will be ready because we can start developing the projects, we can start developing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And with AI, so my new role at my university is instructional innovation with AI.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I used to think that it was the higher education that had to map it to the learning outcomes and the standards.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It doesn't.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can do that with AI.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's, like, easy.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I've been working, you know, one of the things that Edward has been sharing with me is the new curriculum and the learning standards for Uganda.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If we have that and we have, like, restorative agriculture, we have practices that you want to share, if you can connect those to the skills and competencies that...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That the education systems have to address, that the workforce development is trying to address, you literally can create, I'm calling them seed packets, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They're educational seed packets.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then the colleges and the schools can just connect in without having to do all the work.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That sounds like a very powerful approach and a very powerful vector for getting our message into the educational system.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you can give us a tour so we understand that particular pathway, or if you can say, you give me this stuff and I'll begin, that's a potentially powerful and fundable program, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, and ERA can post some of it, right?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can start seeing what pieces you want, then how you connect.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, it's sort of building itself, but I agree it's time to clarify it and put it into motion.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, and I think I wanted to add on one thing.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** After they automatically know what happened in the U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** with the UCEDD, now all the donors have changed their funding strategies.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, all that.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's all work-based and learning-based that they fund a project.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, MasterCard Foundation has founded over 47 million in Uganda, but it's all work-based.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there is an element of experiential learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Our partnership with Gench University in Belgium is still the same.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Haifa International, they are still doing the same.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** By the time I left for Canada, had already signed three memorandums of understanding with three projects.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And for Quad Aid Netherlands, which gets money from Belgium, for two months.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because they have a project for the youth empowerment, but they are just training them in poor financial literacy skills, then they give them work-based learning.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So they are all attached to the Hamlet for training, practical training.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** However, as she said that she's developing the seed packets, we are short of other, what we call the seed packets, because we are having a poultry, we have 20 students now who are left at the Hamlet.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are gaining skills, practical skills in poultry raising, others are in wood culture, and all that, every project, every program has gone to that component of experiential learning and attachment.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So the world is changing, we have also to change.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now the only resort, the only hub that we have around is the Edwards Hamlet, which just needs to develop, and that we can absorb almost all those groups that are in the region.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, the one more piece that connects with Nardin that we have to work on today, too, is, Jon, you're familiar with my use of StoryMaps, which is the ArcGIS tool.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I've experimented.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ArcGIS is the big satellite mapping tool that everybody uses that connects with climate data, and you can create layers.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's very powerful.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in their suite of tools, they have something called StoryMaps, which is this really easy-to-use template for, like, a blog site that you can use to bring in videos.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can bring in beautiful pictures.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It houses all of the digital pieces in the app, so there's no load in terms of hosting information.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And you can create in it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It also has a tool where you could create...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Create a survey and send it out by cell phone to people on the field and collect their data and use it to map.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we experimented with a grant with another partner in Nakavali in Uganda who went out and we just played with it a little bit.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** When you're done, you can publish them and they have their own URL.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I will send you, I had students play with it in a class I developed called Psychology of Thriving that used agriculture as a lens for human thriving.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it works beautifully.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They have very inexpensive memberships for education and nonprofits in the United States, but they have a program where anyone in the world can apply and say what they want to use it for.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we're going to submit a proposal for Edwards Hamlet with this experiential learning lens.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** you.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Meaning that it's a continuation of our work, because everybody should have access to that, and then mapping.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then the tiles of the project.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So imagine people all over the world doing projects in connection with Edwards Hamlet and ERA, however you want to do it.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But you then get to display their projects as tiles.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And StoryMaps is used in connection with National Geographic and Educational Models.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So lots of potential to connect.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Absolutely.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** EcoRestoration Alliance has a non-profit account with ArcGIS, and I used that three years ago when I was building that big map to save the future, which is still sort of lurking in the background.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would love to get an update and a demonstration of what's now possible, because they're a good organization, and they keep on adding interesting features, which...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We could all catch up on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, this notion of a network of files, a network of story maps, it's got to happen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's not really there yet, but it's a natural way to represent our network and our places on the ground.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that sounds great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we should probably hear from other people as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, but by the way, I'm delighted to have you in North America, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I don't know about tomorrow, but even if you're still around, I wouldn't mind driving to Buffalo to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe even tomorrow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Anyway, feel free to reach out if you'd like to get together.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No problem.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm around.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow, that's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And thanks, Edward.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was really powerful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was really delighted to hear all these experiences.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** and plans and what's going on.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, thanks, Mara, as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think we can give time to one person, a new person who joined us.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, he left.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, Enoch.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Enoch, are you here?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You can introduce yourself if you can hear it.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening to everybody.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And how is it going there?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's going well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's always a pleasure to meet new people and to hear about what's happening.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Keeping track of it is a challenge, but hearing about it is a pleasure.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My name is Enoch Totimeh, Ghanaian, and I studied agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I studied agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Roof Forestry, and then Community Forestry.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I actually developed an interest in restoration, landscape restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I began to do landscape restoration on my own, where I mobilized communities to do reforestation of degraded landscape.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Aside the work I'm doing, I voluntarily do that.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So with that, I had the opportunity to, or the interest to develop my own organization, which is called the Silver Natural Green Earth.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And what we do is to restore landscapes.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, in fact, I'm a client to environmental sustainability.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So upon searching through the internet, I got to know of EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I could see what...

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Whatever they do is my interest.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I decided to link up with Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So he also linked me up to Mr.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard to get involved.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So thank you for welcoming me into your group.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm grateful.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Very happy to have you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So your work is done in Ghana?

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because of my work is done in Ghana, but because of financial constraint and then some, I had to hold it on.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now I'm currently in Sierra Leone working as a nursery manager.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that activity is paused for now.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unless I go back and I get some support, then I can carry on with that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Got it.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, Enoch, it's a pleasure to meet you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'll remind...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Uh...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You and Leonce and MUTASA and Takane and Emmanuel that we have our general ERA town hall meetings every two weeks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The next one is Wednesday at 3 p.m.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be two and a half hours later than now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I understand that's at night for you, but I would be delighted to have you attend and introduce yourself as you just did.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And because, you know, each of you are doing exactly the kind of thing we are here to celebrate, encourage and support.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as you can see, we're trying to figure out ways of being supportive and connecting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We haven't figured it all out yet, but it's not it's something we're going to do together, not individually.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'm going to put a link to the meeting into the chat.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I'm going to put my email.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you are available to introduce yourself at 3 p.m.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** on September 17th, ET, I'd like you to email me and I'll put you on the agenda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And by the way, it's by introducing yourself more generally that you become an official member of the EcoRestoration Alliance, and you should then be in our public directory, a link to which I'm going to give you right now.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you have introduced yourself at a town hall meeting, but are not on the public directory, for God's sakes, let me know.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We're trying to include all of our African partners, and because we have these parallel meetings, I'm not sure whether we've thinked it up.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So you ought to be able to.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For example, think Leonce has introduced himself at a town hall meeting, but I'm not sure he's in our public directory.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And, yeah, thanks, Jon.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, Enoch.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to meet you.

**{'display_name': 'Enoch M. Totimeh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Feel free to join all our meetings that will be happening.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I really liked the conversation that happened in this call.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I didn't plan any agenda, just I wanted it to be social and knowledge sharing, kind of experience sharing as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think the last thing we can do is an assignment, because it seems like these international conferences, these gatherings are very critical, very important, and especially healing from the examples from Ananda, Edwards, and Mara, how they gave connections.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I want to ask everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe using three minutes to tell us their thoughts.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If maybe EcoRestoration Alliance could strategize or have any strategy to engage with future international events as an organization, and then update us if you are planning to go to any international event in three months left for this year.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a simple question, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** May I start with Jon?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Though I send you the updates on the conference in Rwanda, don't know if you've seen that, but, yeah, you're the first person on my screen.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You're asking who?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have not seen the outputs of your conference.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I would like to, and I don't have a good answer, but I will say that the link between between what Mara and Edward and

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You were telling us about, and what you were telling us about, does seem to be the MasterCard Foundation, which is a major player, and I think you've both got some connections, so I would ask you to help us figure out how to leverage these relationships and develop something together.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe that's my answer.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the things we do with all of these connections is try to figure out what are the opportunities and build on them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, do you have any plan to go to international events?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know you will go to Climate Works in New York.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I don't at the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I feel that I owe some of the people on this call a visit to Africa, which I didn't go to with Ananda and her party.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will look for this energy.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe during the same time that Mara is in Tanzania, that would be a chance to find it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon Schull, Conference, and attend and get to visit Edwards Hamlet and our other friends in Nakavali and elsewhere.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, that's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can see Mala in the doors, the next on my screen.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I just want to share that there is a call for proposals for an academic conference.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's called ISTA, International, I don't know what it is, and it is a good fit.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I was going to co-author, you have to do a paper, though, it's not a long paper, with my Sequoia University partner.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The conference is in early December in Uganda, so unfortunately the timing, or in early May, and I'm supposed to do my full bride in May, so I don't know if I can attend, but it might, you know, if anyone...

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if interested in that or that forum, I just wanted to mention.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** where is that?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can look it up really quickly.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because it turns out there are a lot of ISTAs, if you just Google ISTA conference.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I don't think you're talking about arthroplasty.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I am most certainly not.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I'll have to look It's okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He can follow up.

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It rotates to different countries each year.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was in Kenya, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I will send it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have we met Emmanuel previously?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if I have.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if I have, I apologize.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, he came to one of our meetings, but he can introduce today.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Why not?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Emmanuel.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, then if not, I will give the flow to Daniel, he's the one next to my screen.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yeah, it's been great.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's great hearing all the things you're working on.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't have major updates.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm less out in the field doing the work, so I'm mostly here in listening mode.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But enjoy hearing about all your projects.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as I've said in the past, feel free to reach out directly if you have any elements of these projects or some of these applications where you would want to be, especially sort of involving the private sector, maybe, you know, building up, you know, partnerships with, you know, local businesses around some of these.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'm an expert.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You know, ecologically sensitive areas.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Those are all my area of enthusiasm.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, great.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you have any planning to travel, like for an international conference?

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I wish.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I have, with all of the changes happening with U.S.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** aid, I have much less international work at the moment, and everybody is, you know, all of my potential consulting clients are very limited in resources.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Jon, I might ping you separately just to see if we're going to overlap in New York for Climate Week.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not actually planning on attending that, but I've been asked to go lecture somewhere else, you know, for a couple of those days.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, if we overlap, I might just see where you are and what you're doing, in case there's any overlap there.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, yeah, other than that, I

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't have, yeah, I don't have, I don't have any big international travel plans at the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, okay, well, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Luz?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Are you here?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Luz.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe he's not allowed.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonce?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonce, what are you doing right now?

**{'display_name': 'Mara Huber- University at Buffalo', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonce, unmute.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe the internet, I can see Luz is here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Luz, do you have any plan to travel for a conference or just a national conference?

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let Let know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** me know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let Let know.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, maybe he's not able to talk.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hashim, hi Hashim.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, thank you to each and everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good evening from Ghana, and I would like to extend my utmost greetings to each and everyone present.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Also to Edward Muntasa, or I don't know, Edward Amlet, for the good work that he's doing.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I learned from the chat that it has been awarded.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Congratulations for that award.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I hope we will receive those, all of us will receive those awards in future.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you to each and everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, thanks Hashim.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But we would like to know if you have any plan to travel.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Or any international event?

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I have the plan to attend the COP30 in Berlin.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are still in the process.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For now, the slot has not been out.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I don't know.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They said on the 15th of September, some of the slots will be out.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is where we will know whether we are included or we are not.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'm planning to travel to COP30 in Berlin, Brazil.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So that is my plan.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you very luck.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The lodge, I hope you can find a place to sleep.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Hashim Yussif', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I may need one if you have one for me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, no, that one is very expensive.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I already decided to exclude myself from that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MUTOKANI.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** to I agree.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** malaria.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MUTOKANI.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, it is my pleasure to be here again, this meeting of today, as I'm Tokani, for those first time to know me.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I'm leading a certain organization, or a CBO, called Agri-Hope, Initiative for Resilience, which is normally based in agriculture and agriculture.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I'm currently living in the Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you don't have any plan to travel?

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** At the moment, not yet, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Mtokani Saleh', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe, Jon, do you want to ask anything?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I don't have any questions at the moment.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Perfect.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Then, see Brian.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** MUTASA.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Greetings, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Mostly, maximum respects to OECD, Edward Munaaba.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We are really happy and blessed of you.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** God gave us you just like a gift, so we really appreciate you.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** With plans of attending the conference, I'm not financially stable as per now, so I can't pick anything there.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Unless when I get a funds, I get someone who can support there, I'll be ready.

**{'display_name': 'MUTASA BRIAN', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But without support, I have no way.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I think some of the time we need to be having, updating ourselves or sharing some links, as Mara said, because there are some links for funding out there for different conferences.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, Thank

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And this is a good opportunity for us to connect and engage with these international conferences and gatherings.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, Leonard, let me ask you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You are going to a number of conferences these days.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Congratulations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you financing these trips?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, wow.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice question.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think, yeah, I never finance myself.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I never pay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't have money.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So what I do, because I've been engaging with different organizations, and I'm very active on social media, then when I find links, I send my application, and then they support me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And some of them, like the one that I attended, listen tree, it was a surprise I didn't know even.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I didn't apply.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** They send me a ticket, because I've been working for them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Volunteering.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we need to, that's why I said we need to be active and share these kind of opportunities with our members.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So being active and trying to apply all these things, but also try to volunteer with different organizations, it puts you on the spotlight and gives you some of the opportunities to represent youth in your countries.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's how I do it, basically.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's a very helpful answer.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think other people on this call could probably get some help from you in identifying those opportunities, in reaching out and making themselves known.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We have a number of very articulate people with good stories to tell, and if it's working for Leonard, it could probably work for others as well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it probably wouldn't hurt if you had people.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** There us vouching for you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it takes initiative, but apparently it can be done.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because that's why they have been saying they don't have funding.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like, for example, in Rwanda, they are coming to an important event.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One is World Agroforestry Congress.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But even if I'm in Rwanda, that one is very expensive.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Like the registration fee.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I couldn't find registration fee, but I got a chance to get an organization to pay for me.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I got an opportunity to speak there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I applied for my project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will be speaking there on that.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's how I do it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And there is another one on Youth Biodiversity, African Youth Biodiversity Forum.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's also coming to Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll be attending all those.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think, I was thinking of...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe having a day to share opportunities on our social media, like as a post, so that people can still see them.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm not sure if even our members are following our social media, but I think that would be a good way.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe each Friday or one of the day, I've been thinking on doing such kind of things so that people can find the links for different opportunities, either attending conferences or scholarship for masters and everything.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will try that one.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think that's a great idea, Leonard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And of course, also posting it into the ERA Africa WhatsApp group, which does seem to be connecting people successfully.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, you know, establishing those cross-pollinations is probably the right way to go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And pulling together those opportunities, I think, will be a real contribution.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Exactly.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, that's true.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And again, that's why I was asking if we need to strategize and we need to be active because like the, I can tell the story that I'm doing a project like the one Mara and Edwards are trying to do.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm starting a project with Marie-Pierre.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I started already to do something with school, children in primary school.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So we are going to set some kitchen gardens and food forestry.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And yesterday I went to meet some of the students.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We created agriculture crab.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Each school you are going to create agriculture crab.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then this crab will work with us, pray with soil and do things.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think that's kind of experiential learning is very key.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I will be sharing on social media.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's amazing.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm loving this one, though we are working with two schools and the result.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That was because I'm part of EcoRestoration Alliance.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I met Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I met Marie-Pierre.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then we built something.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Meeting people is very key.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's why we need to expose ourselves.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Ananda, then the floor is yours.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Well, don't have much to say.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** have got no plans to go to any international conferences.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I only go when I get invited and my expense is paid.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, that doesn't happen every day.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's hard.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It's a lot of work.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, Leonce, now can you talk?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The Flipper.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, I think I don't have...

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Emanuel, can you hear us?

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Lona.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very excited to see you once again.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been lost your contact, but during the night I have been seeing your notification about this ARR.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very, very interested to be a part of this meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe this is my first meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've seen some people from different areas who are taking very, very good constructive idea about it.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Easy environmental restoration.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And then about the project, and I'm very excited about your project as I'm working every day with the student, a lady, I'm supporting you.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if you allow me to be a part of your starting project about Greeny Garden, here in Lubavu, we have a very, very good area to be, included.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** about the agenda, maybe we were talking too much about the grid event that we'll be taking in Rwanda.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But of course, of course, financially, I'm not able to participate if it is very soon.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But if it will take too long, maybe I will arrange myself to be a part of at least one, at least one.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Maybe you would be giving much more about it.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The, the event.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know for sure there will be there for class.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Which university are you in?

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't even remember.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, we are having, we are in the same class in university, Unilac.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, in the same class.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you say that?

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Remember, we have a very common presentation about, maybe there's a module that you have possible.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Would you mind opening your camera, Because, oh, my God.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Let me go to the show.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Where you have, you may see me.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, he's Emanuel.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Have you seen him?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, I know you, guy.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm very excited to see you once again.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I was on my way from a job.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm on my way.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, you.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you so much for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** My warm greetings to everyone here.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, thanks.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Greetings to you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you for saying hello.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Emmanuel URAMUTSE', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thank you, too.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I think everyone stayed, and I don't have any...

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Marius just joined us.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yes.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hi, Marius.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Wow.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Nice to see you.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Leonard, how are you?

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Marius.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, I'm very sorry because I'm traveling to Kampala.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I go to Turkey because we have a big project here, the project in the water.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Auto-purification, but I go to take the pump, we say, Clark family sends us the pump to...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** ...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For us, yeah, for our project, but I'm the advice to go to Kampala, but I think I can share the document with our project because we, for now, we're supposed to support, yeah, I think, yeah, 30,000, 30,000 families for all here in Nakivale because we are, we can put the pipe in the lake and we can pump the water, we we can, we can couple the, the, filtration and the UV filter, but for now, I'm, yeah, I can get, I can go, I can, no, I think I can don't get, I can don't share the main information, but we need to finish all the program and all the documents I can share for, Thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Members of ERA and the members of all the partners.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's great, Marius.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I look forward to hearing more about it.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Working on a water filtration using the biochar.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello, Ananda.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Working with partners from the UK.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** For now, I share the document with Colombo for collaborating with the biochar project.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But for now, I'm not the manager for biochar, but for now, I'm focusing on the project water, because in Naki Valley, the water is a big problem in Naki Valley.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But, yeah, I thank the family, Clark family, Elnell, Chris, and Mary, for supporting our project, because for now,

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Now, we have the capacity to supply many families here in Akivali, but it's a prototype for this camp in the New Congo and the New York villages, but we need, yeah, we are thinking January, we can put the projects in many, many villages in Akivali.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's very exciting, Marius.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** The other piece of that puzzle will be to take measures to make sure that you don't drain the lake.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** As pumping increases, it's going to be important to also make sure that water soaks back into the soil, that vegetation prevents drying out, and we're going to want to pay attention to increasing the availability of water in the lake as well as increasing the availability of water.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** From the lake.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If everybody is using that water in any case, it's just whether they have clean water.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it's very much a health issue.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That's an exciting project.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Congratulations.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Look forward to hearing more about it.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I can share the whole document with ERA members, what we are doing, our challenges, our advising, because ERA, we have many members, we have many expertise for the water, for the many things.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But for now, we are thinking our minds, our projects, we are thinking to, yeah, we are thinking to do, it's a prototype, not a big project, but it's a prototype.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If you are working, it would be cool.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because Leonel and Chris Clarke are buying two pumps.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One pump is the capacity to pump the water for five kilometers.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But for now, we can use one pump.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** If the pump is doing very well, but we have many challenges.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We can...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, we're here.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Hello.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I'm a bus, so easy information, but I can share the document with Ananda and the member for ERA.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Because I'm a bus, and I have many...

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Ir Marius Z', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, thank you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, yeah, I think that's the, we can conclude our meeting.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And Jon, I booked a call with you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I don't know if you have a call.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I see it on my calendar, and I'm happy to meet with you.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you mind if you can do it now, or if you have time?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, actually, I'm scheduled to meet with Diana now.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I can reach out to you when that meeting is over.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, no worries.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So, thanks everyone for joining.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** It was really nice.

**{'display_name': 'Ananda Fitzsimmons', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Bye, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Daniel Langfitt', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Thanks, everyone.

**{'display_name': 'Leonce Bulonze', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Take care.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull, EcoRestoration Alliance', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Good to see you all.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Hello, Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** How are you?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I'm doing well.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** How are you doing?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I'm fine.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've just tuned into ERA Africa, and yet, and I thought I was late, but there's nobody here.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Do you know what the story is?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** No, no.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I just became available.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I lost your audio, Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Huh.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Can you hear it now?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** No, you're not on mute, but I'm not hearing it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Try again?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There you go.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Oh, yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So it came on.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Okay, good.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, I was, I had a few things going on.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I just, last time it went over about 10, 20 minutes, so I figured I might catch it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, there.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** There you go.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I've been getting periodic emails about an impending offering from Russ George and Company, but I don't believe I've gotten it yet, right?

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Correct.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I'll send it to you today.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** We just finished the PDFs.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I've been going back and forth.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** George Obelian made some suggestions and they acted on them.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And it's pretty tight.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But in the executive summary, which I'll go ahead and I'll send you both of them, normally we want to just have somebody look at the two-pager and then talk to Russ George.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But since you're the one who introduced me to Russ George, you and Rob, I'm sure that you know enough about him to...

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Take a serious look at the executive summary along with the one-pager.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I'll just send you those two things via WhatsApp.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And as you know, George O'Brien is a very strong proponent.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** He's going to be bringing in several people, I think.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And I don't think we're going to have much trouble coming up with the two million.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And the executive summary is going to say very conservatively that they think they'll have a, we think we'll have a eight, that the investment will increase by 18 times within five years.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A bold claim.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Pardon?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** A bold claim, I said.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah, well, I'm sure it'll be at least 50 times.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** I think it'll go up 10 times as soon as the water turns green off the coast of Spain.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Mm-hmm.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** All right.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I look forward to seeing it.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Russ, I'll tell you, if I like it, I'm going to suggest that you convert my loan into equity in that project so that we can get this off our backs.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But I'm going to want to take a look at it first.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Sure.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** That would be good.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** And if I had the money, I would.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Well, I understand, Russ.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** What?

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** Okay.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** But my guess is that you're going to have some equity.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** So maybe that'll open up a possibility.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Right.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So in five years, probably less than that, really.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** One of the questions I had for him is an interesting question.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** You see, to verify the blue carbon credits, there's a standard procedure.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Actually, it's pretty much developed by Russ and it's accepted worldwide now, I believe.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yes, it's supposed to Yes.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But it takes verification, as it should, to go into the carbon markets.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** But one of the other streams of income is the basically carbon credits from the cooling effect of the clouds.

**{'display_name': 'Jon Schull', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': 'jschull@e-nable.org'}:** I understand.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** Yeah.

**{'display_name': 'Russ Speer', 'matched_calendar_invitee_email': None}:** So I asked Russ, George, I said, will that be able to come in quicker than the carbon credits for the blue carbon that's going to get sequestered in the abyss?
