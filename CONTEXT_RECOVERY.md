# CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md

### 1. Overview

**Purpose:** Quickly understand current state and resume integration work

**This document is for:**
- **Humans resuming work** - Use this to quickly resume where you left off
- **AI assistants getting oriented** - Read this AFTER AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md for current state
- **Anyone lost** - Check this to understand what's working, what's in progress, what's next

**This document contains:**
- Current system state (what's working)
- Recent completions (what just finished)
- Data inventory (where data lives, what it contains)
- Integration status (which phases complete, which in progress)
- How to resume work (verification commands, common tasks)
- Next steps (what to do next)

**Note for AI:** This gives you current state - don't propose changes without understanding history. Check `historical/` folders for context on past decisions. Your role: Help human navigate options, research details, execute approved tasks.

### 2. Orientation - Where to Find What

**You are at:** System-wide context recovery document

**Use this when:**
- Resuming work after time away
- Checking what's currently in progress
- Verifying system health
- Finding next available tasks

**What you might need:**
- **Main overview** ‚Üí [README.md](README.md) - System architecture and components
- **Strategic plan** ‚Üí ERA_ECOSYSTEM_PLAN.md - Long-term vision (Phases 4-7)
- **AI workflow** ‚Üí [AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md](AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md) - How to work with AI
- **How we work** ‚Üí [WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md](WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md) - Philosophy and practices
- **Component status** ‚Üí Component CONTEXT_RECOVERY files (FathomInventory, etc.)
- **Recent changes** ‚Üí CONFIGURATION_CENTRALIZATION_PLAN.md - Oct 18 migration

### 3. Principles

**System-wide:** See [WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md](WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md)

**Applied in this document:**

1. **Proactive Validation**
   - "How to Resume Work" section provides health check commands
   - Verify configuration, check automation, validate database
   - Don't assume it's working - check first

2. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Last updated timestamp at bottom
   - Recent completions tracked with dates
   - Current phase status clearly stated

3. **Context Preservation**
   - Data inventory (where everything lives)
   - Known issues section (historical context)
   - Quick context questions for AI

4. **Respect for Time**
   - "Start Here" section for quick orientation
   - Common tasks with copy-paste commands
   - Success metrics to track progress

### 4. Specialized Topics

#### Start Here

**Humans:**
- Check "What's Working" to see system health
- Check "What's In Progress" for current work
- Review "Next Steps" for what to do next

**AI Assistants:**
- Read this AFTER [AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md](AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md)
- Use "Quick Context Questions" section
- Don't propose changes without understanding history

#### How to Resume Work

**1. Verify System Health:**
```bash
# Verify configuration
cd /Users/admin/ERA_Admin
python3 era_config.py
# Should show all paths verified

# Check Fathom automation
tail /Users/admin/ERA_Admin/FathomInventory/cron.log
# Should show daily runs at 3 AM

# Check Fathom database
sqlite3 /Users/admin/ERA_Admin/FathomInventory/fathom_emails.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM participants;"
# Should show 1,953+ (grows with each meeting analyzed)

# Check landscape
open https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Admin/ERA_Landscape/
# Should load interactive graph
```

**2. Check Current Work Status:**
```bash
# Check recent completed work
cd /Users/admin/ERA_Admin
cat CONFIGURATION_CENTRALIZATION_PLAN.md
# Status: COMPLETE (Oct 18, 2025)

# Check strategic plan for future work
cat ERA_ECOSYSTEM_PLAN.md
# Active: Multi-system integration

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -5
git status
```

**3. Review Planning Documents:**
- Integration strategy: Read `ERA_ECOSYSTEM_PLAN.md`
- Component details: Read component README files
- AI workflow: Read `AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md`

#### Common Tasks

**Export Fresh Airtable Data:**
```bash
cd /Users/admin/ERA_Admin/airtable
python export_people.py
# Creates people_export.csv with 630 records (+58 from Phase 4B-2)
```

**Check Fathom-Airtable Match Rate:**
```bash
cd /Users/admin/ERA_Admin/FathomInventory/analysis
python validate_townhall_attendance.py
# Generates townhall_validation_report.md
```

**Update Landscape Visualization:**
```bash
# Phase 5T script (when ready)
cd integration_scripts
python export_townhalls_to_landscape.py
# Writes to Google Sheet ‚Üí Landscape updates automatically
```

**Manual Test Integration:**
```bash
# Test Airtable export
cd /Users/admin/ERA_Admin/airtable
python export_people.py

# Test cross-correlation
python cross_correlate.py
# Generates cross_correlation_report.txt
```

#### Known Issues & Context

**Migration from Dropbox (Complete - Oct 18, 2025):**
- Issue: Dropbox file-locking broke launchd automation ("Resource deadlock" errors)
- Solution: Moved entire ERA_Admin to `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/` outside cloud sync
- Current: All components at new location, Dropbox copy is backup only
- Result: Automation working, Git repository active

**Airtable TH Columns:**
- Current: 17 TH attendance columns (manual tracking)
- Plan: Keep updating until Interactive Agenda App ready (Q2 2026)
- Reason: Provides validation data, don't break working process

**Name Variations:**
- Challenge: "Jon Schull" vs "Jonathan Schull" vs "Jon"
- Solution: Fuzzy matching at 80% threshold
- Status: Working well, 61.5% match rate acceptable

**Data Provenance:**
- Challenge: Which system is source of truth?
- Current: Multiple sources, tracked via `data_source` column
- Future: MySQL as single source (Q1 2026)

#### Next Steps

**Immediate (Active Now):**
*Phase 4B-2: Complete Remaining 255 Participants*
1. üîÑ Continue collaborative review rounds
2. üîÑ Target 95%+ completion (~5 more rounds)
