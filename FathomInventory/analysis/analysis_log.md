# Analysis Development Log

## Project: Convert Fathom Analysis Results to Structured CSV

### Objective
Extract structured participant data from `analysis_results.txt` and convert to CSV format for further processing, duplicate merging, and database augmentation.

### Data Source
- **Input**: `analysis_results.txt` (364KB, 158 analyzed calls from Sept 15, 2019)
- **Format**: Structured text with participant information in consistent format
- **Sample Structure**:
  ```
  Name: Mary Olson
  Location: Jersey City, New Jersey
  Affiliation: Brand Intelligence (strategic advisory...)
  Collaborating with People: Jon Schull, Jake, Kelly
  Collaborating with Organizations: Cooling the Climate, Buckminster Fuller Institute
  ```

### Target CSV Structure
```csv
Name,Location,Affiliation,Collaborating_People,Collaborating_Organizations,Source_Call_Title,Source_Call_URL
```

### Design Decisions
1. **Preserve Duplicates**: Same person appearing in multiple calls will have separate rows
2. **Source Tracking**: Include call title and URL for each participant entry
3. **Multi-value Fields**: Store collaborating people/organizations as semicolon-separated strings
4. **Missing Data**: Preserve "None listed", "Unknown", etc. as-is for later processing

### Development Log

#### 2025-09-21 22:53 - Project Initialization
- Created analysis_log.md to track development progress
- Analyzed sample data structure from analysis_results.txt
- Confirmed 158 unique calls analyzed with structured participant data
- Next: Create parser script to extract participant data

#### 2025-09-21 22:54 - Parser Implementation Complete
- ✅ Created `parse_analysis_results.py` script
- ✅ Successfully extracted 1,271 participant records from 157 calls
- ✅ Generated `participants.csv` with structured data
- ✅ 540 unique names identified (with duplicates preserved)
- ✅ Average 8.1 participants per call

#### 2025-09-23 10:32 - Airtable Integration Added
- ✅ Created self-contained `../airtable/` folder within ERA_Admin
- ✅ Built complete Airtable integration system:
  - `export_people.py` - Full People table export
  - `export_for_fathom_matching.py` - Optimized for name matching
  - `cross_correlate.py` - Cross-correlation analysis
  - `update_all.sh` - Routine data refresh
- ✅ Configured for ERA membership database (544 records)
- ✅ Ready for cross-correlation with Fathom participant data

#### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create `parse_analysis_results.py` script
- [x] Test parser on sample data
- [x] Generate full CSV from all 158 analyzed calls
- [x] Validate CSV structure and data quality
- [x] Create Airtable integration system
- [x] Build cross-correlation capabilities

### Notes
- Analysis results contain rich participant data with locations, affiliations, and collaboration networks
- Data quality varies - some entries have "None listed" or incomplete information
- Multiple participants per call - need to associate each person with their source call
- Some affiliations are quite detailed/verbose - may need truncation strategies later

### Future Phases (Post-CSV Creation)
1. Duplicate detection and merging
2. Database augmentation with additional sources
3. Network analysis of collaborations
4. Geographic mapping of participants
