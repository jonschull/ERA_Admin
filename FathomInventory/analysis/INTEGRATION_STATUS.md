# Analysis Integration Status

**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Database Integration - COMPLETE

### What Was Done
- Created `participants` table in `fathom_emails.db`
- Imported 1,271 participant records from 158 analyzed calls  
- **100% linkage** to existing calls (1,271/1,271)
- Created enriched view joining participants with call metadata

### Database Schema
```sql
participants table:
  - id, name, location, affiliation
  - collaborating_people, collaborating_organizations
  - source_call_url, source_call_title, call_hyperlink
  - analyzed_at

participants_enriched view:
  - Joins participants with calls table
  - Adds call_date, public_share_url, etc.
```

### Key Statistics
- **Total participants:** 1,271 records
- **Unique names:** 540 people
- **Date range:** 2023-2024 (158 analyzed calls)
- **Most active:** Jon Schull (156 meetings), Philip Bogdonoff (36), Russ Speer (31)

### Sample Queries
```sql
-- Find all participants in a specific call
SELECT * FROM participants_enriched WHERE call_title LIKE '%Town Hall%';

-- Most frequent participants
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as meetings 
FROM participants 
GROUP BY name 
ORDER BY meetings DESC;

-- Collaboration network
SELECT name, collaborating_people 
FROM participants 
WHERE collaborating_people != 'None listed';
```

## ðŸ”„ Phase 2: ERA Meeting Analysis - NEXT

### Scope
- **112 ERA Town Hall and ERA Africa meetings** (2019-2025)
- Most recent: Oct 9, 2025
- Currently: 0/112 analyzed

### Meetings to Analyze
1. ERA Town Hall meetings
2. ERA Africa meetings  
3. e-NABLE Town Hall meetings (ERA-related)

### Process
1. Mark all ERA/Africa meetings in `era connections.tsv`
2. Run `batch_analyze_calls.py` on 112 meetings
3. Parse results with `parse_analysis_results.py`
4. Import new participants to database

### Estimated Time
- Analysis runtime: ~1 hour (112 calls Ã— 30 sec each)
- Parsing/import: ~15 minutes
- **Total:** ~1.25 hours

---

## ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Daily Automation - PLANNED

### Goal
Integrate participant analysis into daily automation cycle

### Workflow Design
```
Daily automation (run_all.sh):
  1. Discover and share new calls âœ… (existing)
  2. Download emails âœ… (existing)
  3. NEW: Analyze ERA meetings
     - Check for new ERA Town Hall / ERA Africa calls
     - Run AI analysis on them
     - Extract participants
     - Import to database
  4. Send daily report (include analysis stats)
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Create `analyze_era_calls.py` - filter and analyze ERA meetings
2. Add to `run_all.sh` as Step 3.5 (after email download)
3. Update daily report to include participant stats
4. Test on one meeting before automating

### Success Criteria
- New ERA meetings automatically analyzed within 24 hours
- Participant database stays current
- No manual intervention required

## ðŸ“Š Current Data Coverage

### Analyzed (Phase 1 - Complete)
- 158 meetings from various dates
- 1,271 participant records
- 540 unique people

### To Analyze (Phase 2 - Pending)
- 112 ERA/Africa meetings
- Expected: ~900-1,200 additional participant records
- Timeline: 2019-2025

### Future (Phase 3 - Automated)
- All new ERA meetings (ongoing)
- Estimated: 2-4 meetings/week
- Continuous participant network growth

---

## Files Created

### Phase 1
- `schema_participants.sql` - Database schema
- `import_participants.py` - CSV to database importer
- `participants.csv` - Source data (1,271 records)

### Existing
- `ask_fathom_ai.py` - Individual call analysis
- `batch_analyze_calls.py` - Batch processing
- `parse_analysis_results.py` - Extract structured data
- `run_analysis_wrapper.py` - Watchdog for long runs

---

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Mark 112 ERA meetings in TSV
2. **Then:** Run batch analysis on ERA meetings
3. **Finally:** Design daily automation integration

**Ready to proceed with Phase 2?**
