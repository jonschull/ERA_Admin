## ‚úÖ Good News: Recent Coverage Excellent

**Oct 1-6, 2025:** All 11 Zoom recordings have matching Fathom entries
- System is working correctly now
- This validates recent improvements (Oct 17)

---

## üîç Likely Explanations

### Voice Recordings (3 on Sep 21)
- These are "Voice Recording" not Zoom meetings
- Fathom may not join voice-only sessions automatically
- **Decision needed:** Should these be captured?

### "Impromptu Zoom Meeting" titles
- Many Zoom meetings with specific names appear as "Impromptu" in Fathom
- This is normal Fathom behavior when it can't detect meeting title
- Not necessarily missing, just different labeling

### Duplicate Zoom IDs
- Sep 15: Same ID (88342703498) appears twice - likely recording restart
- Sep 10: Same ID (86428246629) appears twice - likely recording restart
- These are Zoom duplicates, not Fathom issues

---

## üìå Recommended Actions

1. **Sep 23 gap** - Investigate why no Fathom entry exists
   - Was Fathom invited to the meeting?
   - Check meeting settings in Zoom

2. **Voice recordings** - Decide policy
   - Should voice-only recordings be captured?
   - May need different workflow for these

3. **Title mismatches** - Accept as normal
   - Many are likely captured but with "Impromptu" or different titles
   - Fathom's title detection varies

4. **Old recording (Nov 2024)** - Deprioritize
   - Nearly a year old, historical interest only

## üìä System Health Indicator

**The fact that Oct 1-6 has perfect coverage (11/11) confirms:**
- ‚úÖ Current system is working correctly
- ‚úÖ Authentication is functional
- ‚úÖ Automated sharing is operational
- ‚úÖ Email processing is capturing everything

**The gaps are primarily in September, before system improvements.**

---

**Next Steps:** Manual review of Sep 23 meeting and voice recording policy decision.
