# ERA Meeting Participant Analysis Automation (Phases 1-3)

## 🎯 Overview

Complete implementation of automated ERA meeting participant analysis and database integration. This PR adds comprehensive participant tracking to the Fathom Inventory System with zero manual intervention required.

## 📊 What's New

### Phase 1: Database Integration ✅
- Created `participants` table in `fathom_emails.db`
- Full foreign key linking to `calls` table
- `participants_enriched` view for easy querying
- Imported 1,271 initial participant records (100% linkage)

### Phase 2: ERA Meeting Analysis ✅
- Analyzed 103 ERA Town Hall and ERA Africa meetings (2023-2025)
- Extracted 289 new participant records
- Added 79 new unique individuals
- **Total: 1,560 participants from 619 unique people**
- **1,270 ERA/Africa records** (81% of database)

### Phase 3: Daily Automation Integration ✅
- Created `analyze_new_era_calls.py` orchestrator
- Integrated into `run_all.sh` as **Step 3.5**
- Enhanced daily report with participant statistics
- Fully automated - new ERA meetings analyzed within 24 hours

## 📈 Results

### Top ERA Town Hall Participants
| Participant | Meetings |
|-------------|----------|
| Jon Schull | 64 |
| Philip Bogdonoff | 33 |
| Russ Speer | 31 |
| Ananda Fitzsimmons | 26 |

### Modified Files
- **`run_all.sh`** - Added Step 3.5 (ERA meeting analysis)
- **`scripts/send_daily_report.py`** - Added participant statistics section
- **`CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md`** - Updated with automation details
- **`analysis/batch_analyze_calls.py`** - Added --limit flag for testing

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE participants (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    location TEXT,
    affiliation TEXT,
    collaborating_people TEXT,
    collaborating_organizations TEXT,
    source_call_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    source_call_title TEXT,
    call_hyperlink TEXT,
    analyzed_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (call_hyperlink) REFERENCES calls(hyperlink)
);

CREATE VIEW participants_enriched AS
SELECT p.*, c.date, c.title, c.public_share_url
FROM participants p
LEFT JOIN calls c ON p.call_hyperlink = c.hyperlink;
```

## 🔄 Updated Daily Workflow

**Before:**
```
Step 1: Discover & share calls
Step 2: Wait 5 minutes
Step 3: Download & process emails
Step 4: Send daily report
```

**After:**
```
Step 1: Discover & share calls
Step 2: Wait 5 minutes  
Step 3: Download & process emails
Step 3.5: Analyze ERA meetings ⭐ NEW
  └─> Sync ERA meetings
  └─> Run AI analysis
  └─> Extract participants
  └─> Update database
Step 4: Send daily report (with participant stats) ⭐ ENHANCED
```

## 📧 Enhanced Daily Report

**New Section:**
```
🤖 PARTICIPANT ANALYSIS
- Total participant records: 1,560
- Unique individuals: 619
- ERA community members: 1,270
- New participants today: X
```

## 🎁 Benefits

✅ **Time Savings:** 15-30 min/week (manual analysis eliminated)  
✅ **Data Freshness:** 24-hour max lag (was days/weeks)  
✅ **Comprehensive Tracking:** ERA community network fully mapped  
✅ **Daily Metrics:** Participant stats in every report  
✅ **Zero Intervention:** Fully automated end-to-end  
✅ **Crash Resistant:** Incremental processing with recovery  

## 🔍 Example Queries

```sql
-- Most active ERA participants
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as meetings 
FROM participants 
WHERE source_call_title LIKE '%ERA%'
GROUP BY name ORDER BY meetings DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Collaboration network
SELECT p1.name, p2.name, COUNT(*) as times
FROM participants p1, participants p2
WHERE p1.call_hyperlink = p2.call_hyperlink 
  AND p1.id < p2.id
GROUP BY p1.name, p2.name
HAVING times > 3;

-- Geographic distribution
SELECT location, COUNT(DISTINCT name) as people
FROM participants
WHERE location NOT IN ('Unknown', '')
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY people DESC;
```

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Tested with no new meetings (minimal overhead ~3s)
- ✅ Tested with 2 new meetings (successful analysis)
- ✅ Daily report integration verified
- ✅ Participant stats appearing correctly
- ✅ Database integrity maintained
- ✅ Crash recovery tested (successful resume)

## 📝 Documentation

- **User Guide:** `analysis/README.md`
- **Context Recovery:** `analysis/CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md`
- **Phase 2 Details:** `analysis/PHASE2_COMPLETE.md`
- **Phase 3 Details:** `analysis/PHASE3_COMPLETE.md`
- **Participant Directory:** `analysis/ERA_Town_Hall_Participants.md`

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **Timeout rate:** 35% of recent ERA Africa meetings timed out during analysis
- **Cause:** Fathom AI slow response or page changes
- **Impact:** 56 of 159 marked meetings not yet analyzed
- **Mitigation:** Can retry individually if needed, 65% success rate provides good coverage

## 🚀 Deployment

**No manual steps required!** The automation will run on next daily cycle (10:00 AM).

**To verify tomorrow:**
1. Check daily email for participant stats section
2. Review logs for Step 3.5 execution
3. Confirm any new ERA meetings were analyzed
