2. **Dependencies properly managed** - Clean requirements.txt with pinned versions
3. **Path-agnostic operation** - Works from any execution context
4. **Complete documentation** - README, monitoring guide, architecture diagrams
5. **Automation ready** - plist configured for new environment

### 🔄 Ready for ERA_Admin Adaptation
1. **Clean codebase** - No obsolete files, backups, or development artifacts
2. **Modular architecture** - Easy to customize for ERA-specific needs
3. **Flexible configuration** - Can be adapted for different schedules, emails, etc.
4. **Comprehensive testing** - Validation pipeline ensures data integrity

## 📋 Next Steps for ERA_Admin Project

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Customize for ERA context:**
   - Update email addresses for ERA-specific recipients
   - Modify automation schedule if needed
   - Update documentation with ERA branding/context

2. **Deploy automation:**
   - Copy plist to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.era.admin.fathom.plist`
   - Load with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.era.admin.fathom.plist`
   - Test automation with manual run

3. **Provide credentials:**
   - Add `credentials.json` for Google API access
   - Add `fathom_cookies.json` for Fathom.video access
   - Run initial authentication flows

### Future Enhancements
