# October 9, 2025 - Critical System Fixes

## Summary

Today we discovered and fixed a **critical configuration error** that had been causing cascading failures throughout the system. The root cause was downloading emails from the wrong Gmail account. This fix, along with several related improvements, brought the system to **99.7% operational status**.

## üî¥ Critical Issue: Wrong Gmail Account

### The Problem
- **Configured to share TO:** `fathomizer@ecorestorationalliance.org` ‚úì
- **Actually downloading FROM:** `jschull@gmail.com` ‚úó

### How It Happened
The `token.json` OAuth file was authenticated with the wrong account. When re-authenticating after issues, we used the personal account instead of the system account.

### Cascading Failures This Caused
1. **Wrong URL types** - Personal forwards contain `/calls/` URLs (require login), not `/share/` URLs (public)
2. **Date mismatches** - Different email formats from different accounts
3. **Missing recent emails** - Shares sent to fathomizer@ never downloaded
4. **Low URL coverage** - Only 0-14% instead of expected 99%+

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Account Verification (CRITICAL)
**File:** `scripts/download_emails.py`
**Change:** Added mandatory account check on every run
```python
profile = service.users().getProfile(userId='me').execute()
expected_email = 'fathomizer@ecorestorationalliance.org'
if current_email != expected_email:
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error
```
**Result:** System will now detect and refuse to run with wrong account

### 2. Date Normalization
**Files:** 
- `run_daily_share.py` - Normalize scraped dates
- `email_conversion/fathom_email_2_md.py` - Normalize parsed dates
- `scripts/download_emails.py` - Already had normalization

**Change:** All dates written as ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
**Backfill:** Normalized 1,604 calls + 1,855 emails (one-time operation)
**Result:** Consistent date matching, no more "Oct 7" vs "October 07" issues

### 3. URL Prioritization & Duplicate Matching
**File:** `scripts/download_emails.py`
**Changes:**
- Filter to ONLY process `/share/` URLs (ignore `/calls/` URLs)
- Use duration as tiebreaker for duplicate titles on same day
- Track used calls to prevent double-linking

**Result:** All 5 duplicate-title calls on Oct 9 correctly matched to unique share URLs

### 4. Real-Time Metadata Extraction
**File:** `scripts/download_emails.py`
**Change:** Extract metadata at download time, not in batch
```python
markdown_result, stats = convert_html_to_markdown(body_html, extract_stats=True)
# Insert all metadata fields immediately
```
**Result:** No more manual `batch_database_converter.py` runs needed

### 5. OAuth Scope Fix
**File:** `scripts/download_emails.py`
**Change:** Request both `readonly` and `send` scopes together
**Result:** Single token works for both downloading and sending reports

### 6. Script Cleanup
**File:** `run_all.sh`
**Change:** Removed undefined `MIRROR_LOG` references
**Result:** No more "No such file or directory" errors

### 7. Report Health Check Fix
**File:** `scripts/send_daily_report.py`
**Change:** Use `ORDER BY rowid DESC` instead of date string sorting
**Result:** No more false "STALE EMAIL DATA" alerts

## üîß Testing Performed

### 1. Manual Fixes Audit
Verified all 7 manual interventions are now automated:
- ‚úÖ Account verification
- ‚úÖ URL linking 
- ‚úÖ Email parsing
- ‚úÖ Date normalization
- ‚úÖ OAuth scopes
- ‚úÖ Script errors
- ‚úÖ Report health checks

### 2. Automated Job Test
- Triggered launchd job manually
- Verified timer works (scheduled for 3:39 PM, triggered exactly on time)
- Confirmed no deadlock errors after moving out of Dropbox
- Verified correct account used throughout

### 3. Duplicate Title Matching
Tested with 5 calls on Oct 9:
- 2 "ERA Africa" (6 mins, 55 mins)
- 3 "Impromptu Zoom Meeting" (25 mins, 28 mins, 57 mins)
- All 5 correctly matched to unique `/share/` URLs by duration

### 4. Report Generation
- Generated and sent test reports
- Verified all public URLs display correctly
- Confirmed no false health alerts
- Validated email sending works with new OAuth scopes

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Trust But Verify
The system said it was working, but 14% URL coverage should have been a red flag earlier. **Always validate that success metrics match expectations.**

### 2. Root Cause Analysis Is Critical
We initially tried fixing symptoms (date formats, URL linking logic) before discovering the root cause (wrong Gmail account). **Start with configuration verification.**

### 3. Automated Verification Prevents Regression
Adding the account check to the script ensures this specific error can never happen again silently. **Build verification into the workflow.**

### 4. Test The Full Stack
Manual script runs worked fine, but the automated job had different behavior. **Test automation in the actual deployment environment.**

### 5. Date Formats Are Evil
Three different date format bugs caused linking failures. **Normalize data at entry points, not during processing.**

## üìã Verification Checklist (Weekly)

Run these commands to verify system health:

```bash
# 1. Correct Gmail account (CRITICAL)
./venv/bin/python -c "
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file('token.json')
service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)
profile = service.users().getProfile(userId='me').execute()
print('‚úÖ' if profile['emailAddress'] == 'fathomizer@ecorestorationalliance.org' else '‚ùå')
"

# 2. URL coverage
sqlite3 fathom_emails.db "
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN public_share_url LIKE '%/share/%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as share_urls,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN public_share_url LIKE '%/share/%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 1) as percent
FROM calls;
"
# Expected: ~99.7%

# 3. Date formats
sqlite3 fathom_emails.db "
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM calls WHERE date LIKE '____-__-__') as iso_calls,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM calls) as total_calls;
"
# Expected: iso_calls = total_calls

# 4. Recent activity
sqlite3 fathom_emails.db "
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM calls WHERE date = date('now');
"
# Should show today's calls if any were shared
```
