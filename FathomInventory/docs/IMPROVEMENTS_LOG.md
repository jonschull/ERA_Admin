## Recent Improvements

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Configuration Error Discovery & Fix (Oct 9, 2025)
**Problem**: System was downloading emails from WRONG Gmail account, causing cascading failures  
**Root Cause**: `token.json` authenticated with `jschull@gmail.com` instead of `fathomizer@ecorestorationalliance.org`  
**Symptoms**:
- Wrong URL types: Showing `/calls/` URLs (require login) instead of `/share/` URLs (public)
- Date format mismatches: "Oct 7, 2025" vs "October 07, 2025" preventing linking
- Missing recent emails: Shares sent to fathomizer@ but never downloaded
- Low URL coverage: Only 0-14% instead of expected 99%+

**Solution**: Multi-part comprehensive fix  
**Changes Made**:
1. **Re-authenticated with correct account**
   - Deleted incorrect `token.json`
   - Re-ran OAuth flow with `fathomizer@ecorestorationalliance.org`
   - Added verification commands to documentation
   
2. **Implemented date normalization** (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Updated `run_daily_share.py`: Normalize scraped dates at entry
   - Updated `email_conversion/fathom_email_2_md.py`: Normalize parsed dates
   - Backfilled 1,604 calls + 1,855 emails with normalized dates
   
3. **Prioritized public share URLs**
   - Updated email parser to prefer `/share/` over `/calls/` URLs
   - Re-linked all calls to emails with new URL priority
   - Result: 1,600/1,604 calls now have public share URLs (99.8%)
   
4. **Documentation created**
   - New: `docs/CONFIGURATION_ERRORS.md` - Complete error documentation
   - Recovery procedures for wrong account configuration
   - Prevention checklists and verification scripts
   - Updated README.md with prominent status section

## Planned Improvements

### ‚úÖ Analysis Folder Organization (Sept 21, 2025)
**Problem**: Analysis scripts scattered in root directory, poor organization for expansion  
**Solution**: Dedicated `analysis/` module with proper path management  
**Changes Made**:
- Created `analysis/` folder and moved `batch_analyze_calls.py`, `ask_fathom_ai.py`, `run_analysis_wrapper.py`
- Updated file path references in moved scripts (relative paths to parent directory)
- Created comprehensive `analysis/README.md` with usage examples and documentation
- Updated `test_system_integrity.py` to test analysis scripts in new location
- Updated `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` script dependency table and architecture description

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Cleaner root directory structure achieved
- ‚úÖ Better separation of concerns - analysis isolated from core workflow
- ‚úÖ Easier to expand analysis capabilities in dedicated module
- ‚úÖ Matches existing modular pattern (`authentication/`, `email_conversion/`, `parse_mds/`)
- ‚úÖ All integrity tests pass - no functionality broken

### ‚úÖ Directory Rename for Better Organization (Sept 21, 2025)
**Problem**: Poor organizational hierarchy - `FathomInventory/ERA_Admin_Test/` structure limited future expansion  
**Solution**: Swap directory names to create logical ERA admin hierarchy  
**Changes Made**:
- **Renamed parent**: `FathomInventory/` ‚Üí `ERA_Admin/` (now parent for all ERA admin tools)
- **Renamed child**: `ERA_Admin_Test/` ‚Üí `FathomInventory/` (removed "Test", clear purpose)
- **Updated launchd plist**: All paths updated to new directory structure
- **Verified system integrity**: All tests pass, automation working
- **Created comprehensive backups**: Rollback capability and archive backup

**New Structure Achieved**:
```
/CascadeProjects/ERA_Admin/                 # ‚Üê General ERA administrative functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FathomInventory/                        # ‚Üê Specific Fathom system (no "Test")
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ERA_Admin_venv/                         
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Future: MemberChecker/]                # ‚Üê Can add other ERA admin tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Future: GrantTracker/]                 # ‚Üê More ERA administrative functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ **Better organizational hierarchy** - ERA_Admin parent for future expansion
- ‚úÖ **Logical naming** - FathomInventory clearly describes purpose
- ‚úÖ **Removes "Test" designation** - Production-ready naming
- ‚úÖ **Future-ready structure** - Easy to add MemberChecker, GrantTracker, etc.
