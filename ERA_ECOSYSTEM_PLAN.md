## 🌍 The Big Picture: Four Systems Becoming One

### Current Reality (Oct 2025)

We have **four separate systems** tracking ERA community data:

```
1. GOOGLE DOCS AGENDAS → Meeting notes with participant lists (ground truth)
2. AIRTABLE → Manual tracking (592 people, member/donor flags)
3. FATHOM INVENTORY → Automated AI (1,560 participants, daily automation)
4. ERA LANDSCAPE → Network visualization (350+ nodes, relationships)
```

**Problem:** No automatic flow between systems, manual reconciliation required.

### The Vision (2026)

```
MySQL Database (Source of Truth)
    ├─> Airtable (UI layer - views only)
    ├─> Fathom (automated input)
    ├─> Landscape (visualization)
    └─> Interactive Agenda App (replaces manual extraction)
```

**Goal:** Single source of truth, automated data flow, no manual reconciliation.

### External Component (Automated System)

```
/Users/admin/FathomInventory/    ← AI-driven meeting analysis
├── README.md                       (Self-contained: automation, database)
├── CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md

└── fathom_emails.db                (1,560 participants, 1,616 calls)

Location: Outside Dropbox (avoids launchd file-locking issues)
```

**Why separate?** FathomInventory runs automated (launchd daemon). Dropbox causes "Resource deadlock" errors with daemon processes. Solution: Keep automated systems outside Dropbox.

---

## 🎯 Integration Strategy: Phased Approach

### ✅ Completed: Phases 1-3 (Oct 17, 2025)

**Phase 1:** Database Integration
- Created participants table in fathom_emails.db
- 1,560 participants from 619 unique people
- 100% linkage to calls table

**Phase 2:** ERA Meeting Analysis  
- Analyzed 103 ERA Town Hall and Africa meetings
- AI extraction from Fathom recordings
- Automated, crash-resistant processing

**Phase 3:** Daily Automation
- Integrated into run_all.sh as Step 3.5
- Daily analysis of new ERA meetings
- Enhanced daily reports

**Validation:** Airtable vs Fathom = **61.5% match rate** (complementary data sources)

---

### 🎯 CURRENT PRIORITY: Phases 4-5 (Town Hall Visualization)

### Phase 4: Airtable Integration (6-8 hours)

**4A: Validation** ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 17)
- Compared 17 TH meetings, identified gaps
- 183 matched, 141 Airtable-only, 76 Fathom-only
- Report: `FathomInventory/analysis/townhall_validation_report.md`

**4B: Database Enrichment** 🎯 NEXT (3-4 hours)
```sql
-- Add to participants table:
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN validated_by_airtable BOOLEAN;
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN member_status TEXT;
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN is_donor BOOLEAN;
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN email TEXT;
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN airtable_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN landscape_node_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE participants ADD COLUMN data_source TEXT;
```

**Goals:**
1. Fuzzy match Airtable → Fathom participants
2. UPDATE matched records with member/donor data
3. INSERT 141 Airtable-only attendees
4. Result: ~1,700 enriched participants with provenance

**Deliverable:** `enrich_from_airtable.py` script

**4C: Daily Sync** (2 hours)
- Automated daily Airtable enrichment
- Add as Step 3.6 in FathomInventory/run_all.sh

---

### Phase 5: Landscape Integration ⭐ THE VISIBLE WIN (6-8 hours)

**5T: Town Hall Meeting Chain** 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY (3-4 hours)

**The Vision:**
```
ERA Landscape Visualization:

Jon Schull (person)
    ↓ (organizer)
Town Hall Meetings (project node)
    ↓
├─> TH 1-08-2025 (project)
│     ├─> Michael Lynn
│     ├─> Kathryn Alexander
│     └─> [35 other attendees]
│
├─> TH 9-17-25 (project)
│     ├─> Jon Schull
│     ├─> Philip Bogdonoff
│     └─> [35 other attendees]
│
└─> TH 10-01-25 (project)
      └─> [11 attendees]
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Organizes orphan nodes (connects many disconnected people)
- ✅ Shows temporal flow (sequential chain of meetings)
- ✅ Validates pipeline (proves Fathom → Airtable → Landscape works)
- ✅ Immediately visible (interactive, explorable network)
- ✅ High engagement (people can find themselves!)

**Implementation:**
```python
# New script: ERA_Admin/export_townhalls_to_landscape.py

1. Query enriched participants from FathomInventory DB
2. Query existing landscape nodes (don't duplicate)
3. Format as:
   - "Town Hall Meetings" umbrella project
   - Individual TH meeting nodes (project::TH 9-17-25)
   - Person nodes for attendees
   - Edges: person → meeting (attended)
   - Edges: meeting → umbrella (part_of)
4. Export to Google Sheet via Sheets API
5. Landscape auto-updates
```

**Scope Decision:**
- Start with 17 validated TH meetings (high confidence)
- Expand to all 61 after proven
- Same pattern for ERA Africa later

**5A: Remaining People** (if needed)
- People not connected to meetings
- Lower priority (TH covers many)

**5B: Organizations** (2-3 hours)
- Extract from participant affiliations
- Normalize org names
- Export to landscape

---

### Phase 6: MySQL Migration (Q1 2026)

**Not immediate - preparing for it**

**Goals:**
- Migrate fathom_emails.db (SQLite) → MySQL
- Airtable becomes views (UI preserved)
- Landscape connects directly
- Establish as definitive source of truth

**Preparation (Do Now):**
1. ✅ Normalize data in participants table
2. ✅ Add provenance tracking (data_source column)
3. ✅ Create foreign key relationships
4. ⏳ Design organizations table
5. ⏳ Document schema thoroughly

**Timeline:** 10-15 hours total

---

### Phase 7: Interactive Agenda App (Q2 2026)

**Replaces manual extraction from agenda docs**

**Vision:**
- Scribe opens app during meeting
- Search/autocomplete from database
- One-click attendance tracking
- Real-time sync to database
- No more manual Airtable entry

**Dependencies:** Phase 6 complete (build on MySQL)

**Timeline:** 20-30 hours

---

## 🔄 Data Flow Evolution

## 📐 Design Principles

### 1. Incremental & Modular
✅ Each phase delivers standalone value  
✅ No big-bang integration  
✅ Can pause between phases  
✅ Components remain self-contained  

### 2. Data Provenance
✅ Track where data came from (`data_source` column)  
✅ Maintain audit trail  
✅ Enable quality assessment  
✅ Support future reconciliation  

### 3. Non-Destructive
✅ Never delete source data  
✅ Enrich, don't replace  
✅ Keep multiple systems running during transition  
✅ Backup before major operations  

### 4. Component Independence
✅ Each folder has its own README, context docs  
✅ Can work on component without mastering whole system  
✅ Clear interfaces between components  
✅ Integration scripts bridge gaps  

### 5. Validation-First
✅ Validate before enriching (Phase 4A → 4B)  
✅ Test integrations before automation  
✅ Generate quality reports  
✅ Monitor match rates

## 🎯 Decision Points (Resolved)

### 1. Phase Priority ✅
**Decision:** Phase 4B (enrichment) → Phase 5T (Town Hall viz)  
**Rationale:** Complete data enrichment first, then visualize clean data

### 2. Airtable TH Columns ✅
**Decision:** Keep updating until Interactive Agenda App (Q2 2026)  
**Rationale:** Don't break working process, provides validation data

### 3. Organization Normalization ✅
**Decision:** Defer to Phase 6 (MySQL migration)  
**Rationale:** Focus on people first, orgs more complex

### 4. Landscape Connection ✅
**Decision:** Phase 5 via Google Sheet, Phase 6 direct MySQL  
**Rationale:** Use existing architecture, migrate later

### 5. Interactive Agenda Timing ✅
**Decision:** After Phase 6 (MySQL)  
**Rationale:** Build once on final architecture

### 6. Town Hall Scope ✅
**Decision:** Start with 17 validated meetings, expand to 61 after proven  
**Rationale:** High confidence first, demonstrate value

### 7. Folder Structure ✅
**Decision:** Automated systems outside Dropbox, manual projects inside  
**Rationale:** Avoid launchd file-locking, preserve sync benefits where useful
