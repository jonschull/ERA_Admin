## Method 2: Ask Claude to Continue

Ask: "Please continue adding cases 31-206 to the Python file in batches"

## Current Status

File: `all_206_categorizations.py`
- Currently has: Cases 1-30  
- Needs: Cases 31-206

## Once Complete

Run: `python3 all_206_categorizations.py`
This will generate: `all_206_categorizations.json`

Then you can use this JSON as the permanent record for execution scripts.
