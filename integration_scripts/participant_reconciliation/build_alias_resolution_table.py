Build Fathom Alias Resolution Table

PURPOSE:
    Extract alias-to-person resolutions from Phase 4B-2 decisions and create
    a database table that preserves meeting context. Enables queries like
    "show me all of Brian Kravitz's sessions" which returns meetings where
    he appeared as "Brian Kravitz", "bk", "brian", etc.

CONTEXT:
    During Phase 4B-2, we resolved ambiguous Fathom names to real people.
    These resolutions are context-dependent: "bk" might be Brian Kravitz in
    one meeting and Bob King in another. We need to preserve this context.

INPUT:
    - integration_scripts/past_decisions/phase4b2_approvals_*.csv
    - integration_scripts/past_batches/BATCH*.html (for meeting URLs)

OUTPUT:
    - FathomInventory/fathom_emails.db with new table:
      * fathom_alias_resolutions
    - View: participant_meetings (for easy querying)

USAGE:
    python build_alias_resolution_table.py
