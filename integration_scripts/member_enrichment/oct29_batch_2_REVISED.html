I am a multi award-winning sustainability innovator, entrepreneur, strategist, coach and advisor. 

In the 1990s, I developed a process for rapid remediation of contaminated soil using fungi and bacteria and cleaned up multiple former gas works facilities, oil refineries and other post-industrial sites across the UK.

In the 2000's I pioneered the use of advanced data-driven visualisations for sustainability strategy and formulated or refined and implemented sustainability strategies for multiple corporations from SMBs to multinationals, the Federal Government of Canada, the State Government of California and around 40 other states, counties and cities.

I have been a speaker, including keynote presentations, at multiple sustainability/CSR/ESG conferences worldwide, including EcoCity events in San Francisco, Istanbul and Vancouver and have appeared on BBC and CBC television.</div>

        <div class="bio-text">About
One of my biggest inspirations in life is the resiliency and generosity found in nature, the possibility to reduce poverty, restore dignity, rebuild soils, and restore food and water security for people, livestock and all life. 

I am a founding trustee and Director of IGugu Trust, African Coordinator for Regeneration International. I am also a trainer, accredited professional (Communal) in Holistic Management by Savory Institute. 
My experience is designing a regenerative organization and programs. I have 18 years of experience in programs curation, curriculum development, community organizing, networking, land monitoring and using Holistic Management process to implement regenerative actions.

My main interest is to promote abundance thinking and reverse poverty, desertification, loss of wildlife, and climate change and its effects. 

I am also a contributor to different networks on the continent; PELUM, Seed and Knowledge Initiative and Alliance for Food Sovereignty (AFSA). I have contributed to 2 books as a coauthor, and I am conference speaker, bringing stories and issues of small holder farmers to global platforms.

I have been a Judge for the £200 000 Lush Spring Prize award, housed by Lush UK since 2017. With a role to take part in a judging and awarding process for incredible regenerative projects from around the world. 

I am one of the course instructors for Ecosystem Restoration Camps. 

I've been an advisor for the Regenerosity Program supporting organizations and programs in East Africa. This is a program implemented by Lush and Buckminster Fuller Institute in partnership with IKEA. 

I am continuously grateful for my upbringing by my heroic late grandmother, who stood her ground and protected the girl kids she raised from early arranged marriages of the day and a well-wishing UK based family that made me access education. I could have never known the resilience and stubbornness of hope and the great community of leaders on whose shoulders I stand.</div>
