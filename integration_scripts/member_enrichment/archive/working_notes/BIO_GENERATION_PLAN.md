## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 hours)

**1.1 Update bio generation prompt**

Location: `integration_scripts/member_enrichment/bio_writer_pilot.py`

Add to prompt template:
- [ ] PAST_LEARNINGS context check section
- [ ] Organization representative detection
- [ ] Town Hall presenter highlighting
- [ ] Data sparsity handling guide
- [ ] Multi-source verification instructions

**1.2 Create aggregated data files**

For each member, aggregate:
- Database info (location, affiliation, email)
- Airtable contact info
- Town Hall participation count
- Call transcripts if available
- LinkedIn matches if available
- Known organizations from PAST_LEARNINGS

Script: `aggregate_member_info.py` (may need updates)

**1.3 Organize by batches**

Suggested batching:
- **Batch 1:** Tier 1 (10 org reps) - Easiest, richest data
- **Batch 2:** Tier 2 (3 presenters) - Check TH agendas for topics
- **Batch 3:** Tier 3 (20 with context) - 10 at a time
- **Batch 4:** Tier 4 (27 minimal) - 10 at a time, may need research

---

### Phase 2: Batch 1 - Organization Representatives (Pilot)

**Goal:** Generate 10 bios with rich organizational context, establish quality bar

**2.1 Aggregate data for Batch 1**
```bash
cd integration_scripts/member_enrichment
python3 aggregate_member_info.py \
  "Sarah Scherr" \
  "Jeremy Epstein" \
  "Laura Perez Arce" \
  "Steffie Rijpkema" \
  "Lisa Merton" \
  "George Sendero" \
  "Frank van Schoubroeck" \
  "Fadja Robert" \
  "Consolata Gitau" \
  "Wambui Muthee"
```

**2.2 Generate bios using sub-agent pattern**

For each member:
```bash
python3 bio_writer_pilot.py --member "Sarah Scherr"
# Creates task file
# User tells Claude: "Read task_1_sarah_scherr.txt and write bio"
# Claude writes bio
# User pastes to response_1_sarah_scherr.txt
```

**2.3 Review and refine**

Create review pages:
```bash
python3 bio_writer_pilot.py --collect --batch 1
# Creates comparison page with all 10 bios
```

User reviews in browser, edits bios directly

**2.4 Process feedback**
```bash
python3 process_batch_feedback.py 1
# Collects approved bios
# Generates upload CSV
```

**2.5 Upload to database**
```bash
python3 update_database_bios.py batch1_approved.csv
```

**2.6 Upload to Airtable**
```bash
python3 update_airtable_bios.py batch1_approved.csv
```

**2.7 Set "Jon Should publish" flags**
```bash
python3 set_jon_should_publish.py --batch 1
```

---

### Phase 3: Refine Process Based on Batch 1

**Review questions:**
- Was data aggregation sufficient?
- Did prompt generate good quality?
- What needed most editing?
- How long did 10 bios take?
- Any pattern issues to fix?

**Update for remaining batches:**
- Refine prompt template
- Adjust data aggregation
- Create shortcuts for common edits

---

### Phase 4: Batches 2-4 (Remaining 50)

Repeat process for each batch:
1. Aggregate data (10 members at a time)
2. Generate bios
3. Review and refine
4. Upload to database
5. Upload to Airtable
6. Set publish flags

**Estimated timeline:**
- Batch 1 (10): 3-4 hours (includes learning)
- Batch 2 (3): 1 hour
- Batch 3 (20): 4-5 hours (2 sub-batches)
- Batch 4 (27): 6-7 hours (3 sub-batches)

**Total: ~15-20 hours** (can be split across sessions)

---

## Special Cases to Handle

### Organization Representatives
**Pattern:** Lead with organization role
- "Sarah Scherr leads EcoAgriculture Partners..."
- "Jeremy Epstein founded Open Forest Protocol..."

### Town Hall Presenters
**Pattern:** Highlight presentation topic
- "Michael Haupt presented at Town Hall on [topic]..."
- Check Town Hall agendas for presentation details

### Minimal Data Cases
**Pattern:** Focus on ERA engagement
- "Has participated in X Town Hall meetings..."
- "Active in ERA discussions on [topic if known]..."
- Keep it honest - don't fabricate

### Username Resolutions
**Note in bio if relevant:**
- Ivan Owen (formerly listed as emmafisher) - using Emma's Zoom
- Roberto Pedraza Ruiz (username: robertopedrazaruiz)

### Known Conflations
**Craig McNamara:** Known conflation issue - investigate before writing

---

## Quality Standards

### Bio Requirements
- **Length:** 600-950 characters (aim for ~800)
- **Style:** Third person, conversational, narrative (not resume)
- **Tone:** Professional but warm
- **ERA connection:** Specific, not generic

### Required Elements
1. Current work/role
2. Professional background (brief)
3. ERA connection/engagement (specific)
4. Unique value/perspective
5. Optional: Philosophy or personal touch

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Accurate (verified against sources)
- [ ] Right tone (professional but warm)
- [ ] Right length (600-950 chars)
- [ ] ERA connection clear
- [ ] Story not resume
- [ ] No fabricated details

---

## Data Sources Priority

**Trust hierarchy:**
1. **Database + Town Hall transcripts** (highest confidence)
2. **Airtable contact info** (verified)
3. **PAST_LEARNINGS** (human-verified patterns)
4. **LinkedIn** (verify carefully - may be wrong person)
5. **Inference from name/context** (lowest - be conservative)

**When in doubt:**
- Focus on ERA participation
- Note uncertainties in review
- Ask user for clarification

## Next Session Kickoff

**Before starting:**
1. Read this plan completely
2. Review BIO_SYNC_SESSION_SUMMARY.md

```

**Questions to answer in first session:**
1. Is aggregated data sufficient for quality bios?
2. Does prompt generate appropriate style/tone?
3. How much editing is needed per bio?
4. Should we research LinkedIn before generating?
5. Batch size: 10 optimal or adjust?
