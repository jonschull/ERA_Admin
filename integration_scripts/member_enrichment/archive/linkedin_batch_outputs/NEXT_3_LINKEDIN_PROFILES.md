About
About
Strategic leader with 25+ years of experience designing and scaling international development programs for climate-resilient agriculture, WASH, and food security. Adept at working with smallholder farmers, community-based organizations, local stakeholders, and multilateral donors to advance sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity, and regenerative practices. Skilled in stakeholder engagement, UX research, and training-of-trainers (ToT) models to drive bottom-up innovation and long-term impact.

Competencies:
‚Ä¢ Soil Health & Regenerative Practices
‚Ä¢ Smallholder Farmer Support & Value Chain Development
‚Ä¢ Program Design, Scale-Up & Evaluation (M&E)
‚Ä¢ WASH & Ecological Sanitation/ Waste2Resources
‚Ä¢ Ethnographic & UX Research
‚Ä¢ Multi-Stakeholder Engagement & Training
‚Ä¢ NGO Capacity Building & Systems Strengthening
‚Ä¢ Grant Management & Strategic Partnerships


Technical specialist in: container-based sanitation (CBS), composting, community-led sanitation, behavior change approaches, value-chain development, ex-post evaluations, and gender analysis.

Highlights:

In Uganda, Citywide inclusive sanitation is crucial for toilet justice and environmental health. Pollution in Lake Victoria and its surroundings is driven by the lack of sanitation in Kampala's informal settlements and toxic nutrient loading from fertilizer run-off. I'm working with local organizations, waste researchers, farmers, and environmental activists to promote composting and container-based sanitation through skills training, advocacy, value-chain development, and stakeholder engagement. We're creating jobs in the circular economy and seeding innovation to scale nutrient recovery for the production of locally-produced organic fertilizers, and helping informal service providers gain access to stakeholders in the WASH sector. 

My doctoral research examines the many perplexing facets of the global sanitation crisis, from the wicked problem of "human waste" and waste treatment to water pollution, food sovereignty, environmental degradation, and carbon/climate finance policies. We can repair metabolic rifts by recycling nutrients and improving microbial soil health, so why aren't countries recycling these valuable nutrients in excreta at scale?

California has an invisible waste crisis. I'm working with Ryan Smith and the County of Santa Cruz to pilot the first CBS project in the state. We're also collaborating with similar waterless sanitation initiatives in Mendocino, New Mexico, and Nevada where septic systems are too costly to build, and wastewater infrastructure is lacking.

How can the WASH sector draw more interconnections between these important issues? My dissertation addresses many of these concerns head on with regard to nutrients and nutrient pollution -- and the future of water. But how come in practice we're all still so bogged down with the mundane? How can we become more relevant and center to addressing planetary boundaries? Send me a message if you want to have a deep conversation or take part in an interview.

How do we build collective responsibility? Are we even having the right conversations in the WASH sector? Let's hear your thoughts.

In my latest piece, ‚ÄúAqua Vitae: The Living Essence of Water,‚Äù I explore how law, faith, and collective responsibility can converge to restore water equity and sustainability.

Because water is not a COMMODITY; it‚Äôs a COVENANT. A shared trust between people, planet, and purpose. Aqua Vitae calls for a movement, where governments uphold the right to water, communities lead through STEWARDSHIP, and faith TRADITIONS remind us that water is SACRED. When LAW meets FAITH, JUSTICE flows and living water finds its way HOME.

Let‚Äôs rethink how we value water. Let‚Äôs defend water and in doing so, defend life itself.
