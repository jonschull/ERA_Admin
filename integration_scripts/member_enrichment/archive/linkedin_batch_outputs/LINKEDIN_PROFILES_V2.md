## 13. John Perlin

John Perlin began his career at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in the Department of Classics in 1979 as a result of his pioneering research regarding the use of solar energy in antiquity - https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/24/archives/research-finds-greeks-used-solar-energy-ancient-energy-crisis.html 

He became part of the Department of Physics in 2002 at UCSB tasked by Nobel Laureate Dr. Walter Kohn to develop a colloquium on global warming for the university‚Äôs science departments. 

The following year John was hired by the physics department at UCSB to collaborate with Dr. Kohn and fellow Nobel Laureate Dr. Alan Heeger on the film, The Power of the Sun: The History of the Evolution of the Science of Light and Photovoltaics- https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.2216954. The film inspired the University of California, Santa Barbara to embrace the solarization of the campus which John oversaw. He led a symposium at UCSB on May 17, 2018 introducing the scientific work of Eunice Foote, the women who in 1856 discovered that carbon dioxide is the principal cause of Global Warming and that more of that gas in the atmosphere would lead to a hotter Earth(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHc5Ike2GIA). 

He was also the lead curator of an exhibit for the University of California, Santa Barbara based on the symposium which opened on October 28, 2019. For a virtual tour go to https://spotlight.library.ucsb.edu/starlight/eunice-foote-to-ucsb

John currently is a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara.

He is the author of four highly acclaimed books on solar energy and forestry: A Golden Thread: 2500 Years of Solar Architecture and Technology; A Forest Journey: The Role of Trees in the Fate of Civilization; From Space to Earth: The Story of Solar Electricity; and Let It Shine: The 6000 Year Story of Solar Energy - Harvard University Press has chosen A Forest Journey as one of its ‚ÄúOne Hundred Books for Every Bookshelf‚Äù ever published by the press which includes books by such scientific luminaries as Stephen Jay Gould and E.O. Wilson. Harvard University Press also honored the book by designating it as a ‚ÄúHarvard Classic.‚Äù 

Patagonia recently published an updated and enlarged edition of ‚ÄúA Forest Journey.‚Äù He has finished a manuscript on the scientific and feminist work of Eunice Foote and is currently searching for a publisher.

## 26. Frank van Schoubroeck

Co-founder FarmTree: making Agroforestry investable through multi-KPI impact projection
Frank's motto is: "everybody can grow trees and earn", and to this end, he developed software to estimate production, cash-flow and environmental of farms and landscapes. With every new assignment, Frank expands his FarmTree¬Æ Model, and the team working with it with FarmTree BV, that he is co-owning. The emerging Model is used for a range of applications:
1. Combine Plot Modelling with Geodata, assess the potential impact of Landscape Restoration Projects; and link their quantified performance to Sustainable Development Goals (ICRAF-Ethiopia, EUDel-Rwanda)
2. Quantify the impact of Landscape Restoration by comparing baseline and with-project management scenarios for thousands of farms (ICRAF Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia)
2. Based on farmers' testimonies and literature, create a model for Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, and show that it triples cow carrying capacity on sylvo-pastoral farms (World Vision, Kenya) 
3. Quantify investments and economic returns for irrigation facilities for smallholders' horticulture enterprises; often as part of adaptation projects (World Vision / SNV / Oxfam Kenya, Senegal, Mali, Niger)
4. Quantify social and environmental costs and benefits for farm management scenarios: gender-segregated labour inputs, production per area or per labour input; shade, temperature, soil humidity over seasons, soil fertility over decades, carbon, etc.
5. Provide project-level budgets and returns, such as in 2015 Projects d'Appui √† l'Agroforesterie Entrepreneuriale in three West-African countries; in 2014 the Katsina Fuel Wood Balance project of Oxfam
6. Support writing National Agroforestry strategies (EUDel Bhutan)

## 27. Abby Karparis

Founder Imaginal Foundation, Regenerative Farmer using food to build thriving, resilient communities

Abby has also had the opportunity to use farming as a means of travel across the United States, into the Pacific and New Zealand, and down to Costa Rica.  This has diversified Abby's agricultural experience, as wellas knowledge of  the people, ecosystems, and soil types, that she works with and learns from. Community immersion has led me to value community-based solutions and local knowledge, especially that of indigenous populations, and Abby see this, as well as the associated sovereignty, as central to creating industry change and an agricultural system that allows both humans and nature to thrive in regenerative and abundant systems Abby believe in a locally intensive action, supported by a global network. Abby's passion is building empowered, sustainable, and resilient communities through food and agriculture. "Food is our most intimate connection with nature"

## 29. Michael Levin

Professor, Tufts University

Michael Levin's bioelectricity research explores the role of electrical signals in controlling cell behavior, development, and regeneration, challenging the idea that DNA is the sole "blueprint" for life. His work proposes that bioelectric fields act as a "cognitive glue" that guides cells to form complex structures, and this can be harnessed to instruct tissues to heal or regenerate limbs and organs
