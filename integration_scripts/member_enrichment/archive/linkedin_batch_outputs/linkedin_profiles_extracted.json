      "Er is enorm veel gebeurd de afgelopen zomer, er komt veel aan en de structuur voor de versnelling wordt steeds duidelijker. Het is tijd voor een belangrijke update! Op 8 juni 2022 sloten wij de activatiefase van het robuuste uitrolplan in de MRA formeel af in The Natural Pavilion op de Floriade. Tijdens deze bijeenkomst gaven wij inzicht in de oogst van activiteiten en de organisaties die zich hebben gecommitteerd aan het uitrolplan. Lees hier het complete verslag van deze bijzondere dag. De afgelopen 4 maanden hebben wij ons gericht op de samenwerking voor de lange termijn, die zich gefaseerd, vanuit een optelsom van losse projecten, als een zwerm organiseert. Van de 80 deelnemende organisaties zijn 24 partijen naar voren gestapt om een regierol te pakken in dit proces naar gebiedsgerichte samenwerking. Daar zijn we enorm blij mee en trots op! Dennis Kerkhoven (Yes and More), Dirk van der Beek (Labora Returns), Andr\u00e9 Knol (Innomics), Jeffrey Spangenberg (Food Council MRA) en Mark Frederiks (Amped / Local2Local) nemen het voortouw namens de groep om de samenwerking verder te ontwikkelen. Watskebeurt? Data Value Center Agri & Food Korte Keten De korte voedselketen, in de context van een regionaal voedselsysteem, is een serieus ontwikkelingsperspectief voor boeren en producenten en een manier om als inwoners van Metropoolregio Amsterdam, Flevoland en Noord-Holland grip te krijgen op de leefomgeving. Naast het verkorten van de voedselketen is het ook een manier om samen te werken aan duurzame economische, ecologische en sociale doelen. De specifieke problemen die we aanpakken zijn lokale en regionale toegang tot voedsel en voedselzekerheid, het faciliteren van samenwerking tussen steden en regio's op weg naar regeneratieve landbouw, het tegengaan van stijgende voedselprijzen en het gebrek aan vertrouwen in kwaliteitsmerken, een ontbrekend toekomstperspectief voor boeren, een afname van de boerenpopulatie in NL met 50% binnen 10 jaar, instortende ecosystemen, niet-duurzame en sterk vervuilende voedselsystemen, 80% verlies in voedingswaarde sinds 1950, en de noodzaak om 30-40% voedselverspilling aan te pakken. Om deze aan te pakken moeten we korte voedselketens opbouwen door middel van digitale innovatie, de verbetering van samenwerking tussen alle belanghebbenden, alle niveaus op elkaar afstemmen op basis van transparantie, boeren/lokale producenten faciliteren, regionale allianties tot stand brengen en innovatie-ecosystemen in en rondom slimme steden opzetten. De rol van technologie is van fundamenteel belang. Zij vergemakkelijkt nieuwe en waardegedreven bedrijfsmodellen, staat centraal bij innovatie en maakt het mogelijk de democratie opnieuw vorm te geven (maatschappelijke zelforganisatie en pop-up publieke waarde) op basis van data en multi-level, sectoroverschrijdende samenwerking en gamification-mechanismen (GAIN). Amped en Local2Local zijn om bovenstaande redenen onderdeel van het project Data Value Centre Agri & Food Korte Keten. Dit project heeft als doel: \u2018Het doorontwikkelen van een digitaal dienstenconcept voor het mkb ter ondersteuning en vergroting van de mogelijkheden en economische betekenis van de inzet van data voor de voedselvoorziening via korte ketens.\u2019 Het project wordt gerealiseerd door een samenwerkingsverband van ervaren professionals op het gebied van de korte voedselketen/regionale voedselvoorziening en ICT/data-toepassingen. Dit zijn 6 partijen met een groot netwerk van (mkb) bedrijven, kennisinstellingen en maatschappelijke organisaties die bij het project worden betrokken. De projectpartners Voedsel Verbindt, BDVC, Amped, Quant Base, FoodNed en Inzights investeren in de ontwikkeling van het DVC, om toe te werken naar een vraaggestuurd en regionaal verbonden en regeneratief voedselsysteem.

      "\"The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of ecology\" - when Herman Daly said this, he was referring to the fact that in reality, contrary to the beliefs of this particular materialist culture, the environment makes up the support structure of society, and from there society makes up the support structure for the economy. Lots is said about the \"triple bottom line\" but drawing these spheres as a Venn diagram is misleading - it's more like a layer cake, where one supports the other. This basic fact of reality is encapsulated in the Cree proverb \"when the last tree is cut down, the last fish eaten, and the last stream poisoned, you will realize that you cannot eat money.\" These dire words serve as a warning to us all - but to end on a positive note, to flip the script just a bit, we could say that when we invest in ecology and the environment, we improve society, and thereby make right-livelihood sustainable or regenerative economic activity more possible!",
