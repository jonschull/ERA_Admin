With over eight years of experience as the CEO and founder of PSKL Water for All, Ali has expanded his efforts from addressing water scarcity to tackling a broader range of ecological challenges aimed at restoring and sustaining our planet's delicate balance. At PSKL Water for All, the team develops sustainable and scalable initiatives to revitalize desert and arid regions. By leveraging natural rainfall patterns and utilizing fuel-less pumps and unpowered sensors, they aim to conserve and distribute water efficiently, supporting both human communities and natural ecosystems. Ali integrates engineering precision with ecological wisdom, drawing insights from diverse fields such as Greek medicine, permaculture, and hydrology. His background in aeronautics, navigation, and mechatronics allows him to apply a systems-thinking approach to large-scale ecological restoration projects. He holds a certification in permaculture design and has contributed to the field through several published papers on engineering and environmental topics. He is also the author of the Substack newsletter R3Genesis, which focuses on regenerative climate care and translating transformative practices into actionable strategies for landscape restoration. Ali follows the Regrarians approach to land management, inspired by his studies under Larry Korn\u2014Masanobu Fukuoka\u2019s student\u2014and Darren Doherty. Ali's diverse interests and expertise in areas such as Greek medicine and martial arts coaching enrich his holistic perspective on problem-solving, ensuring that solutions are both innovative and deeply rooted in an understanding of human and environmental dynamics.

She owns and manages a 77-acre regenerative ranch with a regenerative cow-calf operation, south of Dallas, Texas. Upon acquisition, the ranch underwent significant prairie and wetland restoration, transforming it from a neglected state into a thriving ecosystem. Dr. Groppe conducts soil studies on the ranch, focusing on the effects of aeration, plant species diversity, and cattle on soil health. Dr. Groppe funds some of the ranch expenses through her handmade jewelry company, Of Earth, which specializes in stone and southwestern-style jewelry (ofearth.etsy.com). Her upbringing in California, with influences from her ecologist father, master gardener mother, and entomologist step-father, fostered her deep connection to nature and science. She holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Ecology from Universit\u00e4t Basel and both Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Dr. Groppe\u2019s professional experience includes developing methods for detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) strains at DAKO, a Danish medical diagnostics company, and researching the effects of global change on grass-endophyte interactions as part of a seven-year interdisciplinary biodiversity project in Switzerland. Her interests span fungal endophytes, the soil food web, rhizophagy, regenerative agriculture, grass-fed beef, epigenetics and health, prairie restoration, wetland restoration, and nature retreats. With over eight years as a molecular biologist, seven years as a molecular ecologist, thirteen years as a ranch owner, six years raising grass-fed beef, and five years as a soil scientist, Dr. Groppe brings a wealth of experience to her endeavors. She also volunteers with the Cancer Support Community of North Texas and Dress for Success, and is an aspiring author.
