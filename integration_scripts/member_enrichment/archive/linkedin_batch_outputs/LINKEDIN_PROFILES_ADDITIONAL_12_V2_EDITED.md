## 10. Kriss Scioneaux

Founder | The Bitcoin Stewardship Initiative & Keystone Conservancy

Kriss is currently building The Bitcoin Stewardship Initiative (TBSI),  a regenerative finance platform designed to fund ecological restoration at scale using Bitcoin-backed capital. Our model is designed for long-term impact, not short-term survival.  Traditional restoration relies on unpredictable grants and donations that are vulnerable to inflation. TBSI flips that model by leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s fixed supply, time preference, and resilience to devaluation to fund work today while accruing value over time.

TBSI is pioneering a conservation finance engine that aligns:

* Landowners: Receive premium ecological restoration at steep discounts.
* Implementation teams: Earn full market compensation for high-impact work.
* Investors: Gain exposure to BTC's upside while generating measurable environmental returns.
* We're currently structuring green bonds, developing stakeholder incentives, and coordinating with partners like Zach Weiss, Mark Shepard, and Keystone Conservancy to prepare for launch.
