                <div class="content-line">In this 35-day experiment, red wiggler worms were released into a bin divided into two zones</div>
                <div class="content-line">✅ One side held finished vermicompost</div>
                <div class="content-line">✅ The other, freshly prepared bedding with food and regular moisture</div>
                <div class="content-line">Expectation was simple</div>
                <div class="content-line">The worms would migrate to the fresh, nutrient-rich section</div>
                <div class="content-line">But the reality was different</div>
                <div class="content-line">They wandered across the entire bin, resting in places that no longer had food</div>
                <div class="content-line">Because worms, like all soil life, are not driven by nutrients alone</div>
                <div class="content-line">They follow microbial signals, structural comfort, hidden energy, and maybe even memory</div>
                <div class="content-line">This is not confusion</div>
                <div class="content-line">🧠 Soil is not passive</div>
                <div class="content-line">It reacts, adapts, and remembers</div>
                <div class="content-line">So building soil health is not about adding more</div>
                <div class="content-line">It is about creating a space where life wants to stay</div>
                <div class="content-line">At the end of 35 days, composting was complete</div>
                <div class="content-line">But not in the way it was imagined</div>
                <div class="content-line">The worms did not just seek what was new</div>

                <div class="content-line">Kathleen Groppe Ph.D., has a  background in molecular biology, fungal ecology, and sustainable agriculture. She owns and manages a 77-acre regenerative ranch with a regenerative cow-calf operation, south of Dallas, Texas. Upon acquisition, the ranch underwent significant prairie and wetland restoration, transforming it from a neglected state into a thriving ecosystem. Dr. Groppe conducts soil studies on the ranch, focusing on the effects of aeration, plant species diversity, and cattle on soil health.</div>
                <div class="content-line">Dr. Groppe funds some of the ranch expenses through her handmade jewelry company, Of Earth, which specializes in stone and southwestern-style jewelry (ofearth.etsy.com). Her upbringing in California, with influences from her ecologist father, master gardener mother, and entomologist step-father, fostered her deep connection to nature and science. She holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Ecology from Universität Basel and both Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara.</div>
                <div class="content-line">Dr. Groppe’s professional experience includes developing methods for detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) strains at DAKO, a Danish medical diagnostics company, and researching the effects of global change on grass-endophyte interactions as part of a seven-year interdisciplinary biodiversity project in Switzerland. Her interests span fungal endophytes, the soil food web, rhizophagy, regenerative agriculture, grass-fed beef, epigenetics and health, prairie restoration, wetland restoration, and nature retreats.</div>
                <div class="content-line">With over eight years as a molecular biologist, seven years as a molecular ecologist, thirteen years as a ranch owner, six years raising grass-fed beef, and five years as a soil scientist, Dr. Groppe brings a wealth of experience to her endeavors.

                <div class="content-line">For centuries, we've mapped mountains, forests, and oceans. Yet what exists beneath the soil surface has remained largely overlooked. Underground ecosystems are home to 59% of Earth’s global biodiversity, but only in the last decade have the necessary tools — environmental DNA analysis and geospatial machine learning — reached sufficient capabilities to explore these hidden networks.</div>
                <div class="content-line">Our new research reveals belowground biodiversity hotspots in unexpected places such as Taiwan's Changhua Plain, the Carpathian Mountains in Romania, and Guinean Forests of West Africa.</div>

                <div class="content-line">'s government over the inchoate Grand Bargain on Energy and Climate.</div>
                <div class="content-line">Despite pipeline-friendly rhetoric, the first iteration of Carney's major projects list notably did not include any. However, as we are frequently reminded, there was not, until yesterday, a proponent for any such pipeline.</div>
                <div class="content-line">said "The issue is not one of there being a proponent. The issue is one of government policy setting the conditions for that to get investment to occur. Let’s be honest, the government has not done that yet, and it’s not clear they intend to, at least from our perspective."</div>
                <div class="content-line">And now we hear from the mega carbon capture and storage project</div>
                <div class="content-line">(a cornerstone of any Grand Bargain), "Canada needs to create the investment climate to allow private investment in the energy sector. [Alberta]’s announcement that they will be an initial proponent for a pipeline to the West Coast is a positive step. To continue building our country’s economic and energy future, we not only need additional pipeline capacity and market access, but we also must ensure that Canada has clear, competitive and durable fiscal and regulatory frameworks in place. Barriers to development like the Emissions Cap, Federal Impact Assessment Act and the West Coast tanker ban must be addressed."</div>
                <div class="content-line">I am fascinated by the unfolding of this drama. This affects all Canadians, whatever their feelings about politics, energy, or climate. We live in interesting times.</div>

                <div class="content-line">Er is enorm veel gebeurd de afgelopen zomer, er komt veel aan en de structuur voor de versnelling wordt steeds duidelijker. Het is tijd voor een belangrijke update! Op 8 juni 2022 sloten wij de activatiefase van het robuuste uitrolplan in de MRA formeel af in The Natural Pavilion op de Floriade. Tijdens deze bijeenkomst gaven wij inzicht in de oogst van activiteiten en de organisaties die zich hebben gecommitteerd aan het uitrolplan. Lees hier het complete verslag van deze bijzondere dag. De afgelopen 4 maanden hebben wij ons gericht op de samenwerking voor de lange termijn, die zich gefaseerd, vanuit een optelsom van losse projecten, als een zwerm organiseert. Van de 80 deelnemende organisaties zijn 24 partijen naar voren gestapt om een regierol te pakken in dit proces naar gebiedsgerichte samenwerking. Daar zijn we enorm blij mee en trots op! Dennis Kerkhoven (Yes and More), Dirk van der Beek (Labora Returns), André Knol (Innomics), Jeffrey Spangenberg (Food Council MRA) en Mark Frederiks (Amped / Local2Local) nemen het voortouw namens de groep om de samenwerking verder te ontwikkelen. Watskebeurt? Data Value Center Agri &amp; Food Korte Keten De korte voedselketen, in de context van een regionaal voedselsysteem, is een serieus ontwikkelingsperspectief voor boeren en producenten en een manier om als inwoners van Metropoolregio Amsterdam, Flevoland en Noord-Holland grip te krijgen op de leefomgeving. Naast het verkorten van de voedselketen is het ook een manier om samen te werken aan duurzame economische, ecologische en sociale doelen. De specifieke problemen die we aanpakken zijn lokale en regionale toegang tot voedsel en voedselzekerheid, het faciliteren van samenwerking tussen steden en regio's op weg naar regeneratieve landbouw, het tegengaan van stijgende voedselprijzen en het gebrek aan vertrouwen in kwaliteitsmerken, een ontbrekend toekomstperspectief voor boeren, een afname van de boerenpopulatie in NL met 50% binnen 10 jaar, instortende ecosystemen, niet-duurzame en sterk vervuilende voedselsystemen, 80% verlies in voedingswaarde sinds 1950, en de noodzaak om 30-40% voedselverspilling aan te pakken. Om deze aan te pakken moeten we korte voedselketens opbouwen door middel van digitale innovatie, de verbetering van samenwerking tussen alle belanghebbenden, alle niveaus op elkaar afstemmen op basis van transparantie, boeren/lokale producenten faciliteren, regionale allianties tot stand brengen en innovatie-ecosystemen in en rondom slimme steden opzetten. De rol van technologie is van fundamenteel belang. Zij vergemakkelijkt nieuwe en waardegedreven bedrijfsmodellen, staat centraal bij innovatie en maakt het mogelijk de democratie opnieuw vorm te geven (maatschappelijke zelforganisatie en pop-up publieke waarde) op basis van data en multi-level, sectoroverschrijdende samenwerking en gamification-mechanismen (GAIN). Amped en Local2Local zijn om bovenstaande redenen onderdeel van het project Data Value Centre Agri &amp; Food Korte Keten. Dit project heeft als doel: ‘Het doorontwikkelen van een digitaal dienstenconcept voor het mkb ter ondersteuning en vergroting van de mogelijkheden en economische betekenis van de inzet van data voor de voedselvoorziening via korte ketens.’ Het project wordt gerealiseerd door een samenwerkingsverband van ervaren professionals op het gebied van de korte voedselketen/regionale voedselvoorziening en ICT/data-toepassingen. Dit zijn 6 partijen met een groot netwerk van (mkb) bedrijven, kennisinstellingen en maatschappelijke organisaties die bij het project worden betrokken. De projectpartners Voedsel Verbindt, BDVC, Amped, Quant Base, FoodNed en Inzights investeren in de ontwikkeling van het DVC, om toe te werken naar een vraaggestuurd en regionaal verbonden en regeneratief voedselsysteem. Amped neemt de ervaring en kennis vanuit het Local2Local-platform, Blockchain-toepassingen, de dataprogramma’s vanuit de TKK, resultaten en consortium van SMARTCHAIN H2020 en de verbinding met de uitrolstrategie naar een regionaal, regeneratief voedselsysteem in de MRA mee in het DVC-project.

                <div class="content-line">"The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of ecology" - when Herman Daly said this, he was referring to the fact that in reality, contrary to the beliefs of this particular materialist culture, the environment makes up the support structure of society, and from there society makes up the support structure for the economy. Lots is said about the "triple bottom line" but drawing these spheres as a Venn diagram is misleading - it's more like a layer cake, where one supports the other. This basic fact of reality is encapsulated in the Cree proverb "when the last tree is cut down, the last fish eaten, and the last stream poisoned, you will realize that you cannot eat money." These dire words serve as a warning to us all - but to end on a positive note, to flip the script just a bit, we could say that when we invest in ecology and the environment, we improve society, and thereby make right-livelihood sustainable or regenerative economic activity more possible!</div>
