      "\"The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of ecology\" - when Herman Daly said this, he was referring to the fact that in reality, contrary to the beliefs of this particular materialist culture, the environment makes up the support structure of society, and from there society makes up the support structure for the economy. Lots is said about the \"triple bottom line\" but drawing these spheres as a Venn diagram is misleading - it's more like a layer cake, where one supports the other. This basic fact of reality is encapsulated in the Cree proverb \"when the last tree is cut down, the last fish eaten, and the last stream poisoned, you will realize that you cannot eat money.\" These dire words serve as a warning to us all - but to end on a positive note, to flip the script just a bit, we could say that when we invest in ecology and the environment, we improve society, and thereby make right-livelihood sustainable or regenerative economic activity more possible!",
