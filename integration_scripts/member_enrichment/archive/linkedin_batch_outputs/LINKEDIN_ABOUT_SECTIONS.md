**Headline:** Climate. Energy. Nature.

An environmental engineer by training, I specialize in the intersection of Climate, Energy, and Nature. My work supports decarbonization in all its varied forms: from Nature-Based Solutions to Clean Fuels, Heavy Industry to Waste Management. I have deep knowledge of North American and international climate regulations, quantification tools, and markets. The interaction of these systems provides a constantly evolving landscape of opportunities and challenges; seizing the former and overcoming the latter is immensely satisfying to me. Analysis would be of little value if I could not share what I see. In another life I was a teacher, and that prepared me well for effectively communicating complexity to stakeholders from the boardroom to the forest in English, French, and Spanish. Charlie Munger said, "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome," but this glosses over the gap between the two. Incentives for sustainability abound; my role is to bridge that gap and turn them into tangible, sustainable outcomes.

**Headline:** Building Framer OS: a workspace & worldview for BaU misfits | Author, Crisis Codes | Global Speaker on the future of entrepreneurship | Founder & Steward, Framer OS | Gen Alpha dad

Most people I work with have already opted out of BaU: Business-as-Usual. Or they've made the decision and are looking for the path through. They left paycheck prison. Walked away from the activism that broke them. Shelved the passion project that doesn’t pay the bills. Or they're still there, but they've already made the hard choice to stop compromising what they know is true. They just haven't figured out how to make it work yet. That's where I come in. I help people like you build future-proof businesses from your lived experience and wisdom, without raising investment. Real businesses. With real income. Built on what you actually care about, even if you haven’t been able to excite others to invest. Here's what that looks like: You've been wrestling with big questions. The meaning crisis. The collapse of systems that once made sense. The feeling that everything's changing and nobody's talking about it openly and honestly. I help you see that these aren't distractions from building a business. They ARE the business. Your questions become your offerings. Your search for meaning becomes someone else’s clarity. Your breaking point becomes your breakthrough. It’s called Vibe Framing. Like vibe coding's natural language approach to programming, vibe framing helps you explore and reframe your experiences using everyday conversational language with AI assistance. All within the context of what’s emerging after the inevitable breakdown of our current social contract. Heavy, I know. But once you see what’s happening, it helps to call it. And to lean into it. The Vibe Framing Operating System helps make it all less daunting. Even inspiring! Who this is for: Paycheck prisoners who can't unsee what they've seen. Activists who gave everything and got crushed. Parents questioning what world they're raising kids into. Artists who've been told their work isn't "practical." Anyone who's been waiting for permission to build something that matters. You don't need permission. You need a path. That's what I will help you find. My approach: No fluff. No fake it till you make it. No pretending the world isn't on fire while we talk about your brand strategy. We start with what's true for you. We build from there. We make it work economically because symbolic gestures don't feed your family. The bottom line: The old playbook is breaking. Most people are terrified. Some people are ready. If you're ready, let's build.

## 22. Nima Schei

**Headline:** Pioneer of Brain-inspired AI (BELBIC 2003). Transforming human-machine authentication. Leading AI for Positive Impact.

I'm a traveler on a journey to emancipate myself from mental slavery. I design AI based on principles I observe in nature, with a focus on creating solutions that scale for maximum scalability and positive impact. Selected contributions to AI: 1- Creating the first machines that made decisions based on emotion and intuition (BELBIC 2003) 2- Developing Guacamole, the first continuous face-based authentication system based on the neuroscience of face cognition 3- Founding the Miami AI Club, a global community of decision-makers, entrepreneurs, and investors dedicated to promoting conscious AI development 4- Serving as AI advisor for the National Applied AI Consortium and Palm Beach State College 5- Contributing to the prestigious Future Investment Initiative (FII) Coalition on AI My entrepreneurial journey includes founding PositiveMed, a platform that reached 400 million users by reliable knowledge that empowered people to lead healthier and happier lives. AI, for me, is Alternative Intelligence. My whole life revolves around understanding nature, leveraging my findings to become more conscious, and using that consciousness to create a positive impact in the world—primarily for the benefit of animals and secondarily for humans. This vision has led me to go deep into science and technology in a multi-disciplinary way (AI, medicine, neuroscience) to understand our intelligence. I've created some leading AI models, including BEL (Brain Emotional Learning), which combines emotion, logic, and intuition. BEL now has 400+ industrial and commercial use cases. At Hummingbirds AI, I'm bringing Guacamole to every computer on the planet: Every computer has chips, so it's time for Guacamole! Our passwordless authentication system eliminates repetitive passwords and saves employees from password fatigue. Through BEL Research, I accelerated developing impact AI, i.e., AI models for pre-Alzheimer's detection, deepfake detection, and AI for predictive maintenance of power electronics components (PERA AI). My collaborations with Columbia University and the Future Investment Initiative, and my role in founding the Miami AI Club reflect my commitment to shaping responsible AI development that creates value for society while respecting ethical boundaries. As a vegan and animal rights activist who has worked against elephant slavery in Asia and shark finning in Colombia, I approach technology with a profound commitment to consciousness and compassion. My life goal is to help humans appreciate and respect every animal, using AI as a force for positive change. I'm a traveler on a journey to emancipate myself from mental slavery.
