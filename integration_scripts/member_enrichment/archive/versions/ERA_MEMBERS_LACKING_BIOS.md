# ERA Members Lacking Bios

**Date:** October 27, 2025

## Summary

- **Total ERA Members:** 391
- **With Bios:** 329 (84.1%)
- **Without Bios:** 62 (15.9%)

# Context:

Member Enrichment

**Purpose:** Complete member onboarding by enriching profiles and bios and preparing for public directory publication

**Status:** üöÄ Active (Oct 25, 2025) derived from member_enrichment/README

---

## Overview

### The ERA Onboarding Process

When someone becomes an ERA member (introduced at Town Hall, no objections, week passes):

**Full onboarding should include:**

1. NOW ‚úÖ Update profile (Bio, email, phone, affiliated organizations) in Database
2. LATER ‚úÖ Publish in public directory (https://www.ecorestorationalliance.org/public-directory)
3. LATER ‚úÖ Add to ERA Landscape visualization
4. LATER ‚úÖ Send welcome email (+ invite to become supporting member)
5. LATER ‚úÖ Add to Google Groups mailing lists

**Reality:** We've been sloppy. There's a backlog.

### Immediate Scope

**This integration focuses on steps 1-2:**

1. **Complete profiles** for members who attended Town Halls
   - Bios (contextual, personalized)
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers (where available)
   - Affiliated organizations
2. **Prepare for updating Airtable and public directory publication** (human activates "Publish" field)

**Current State:**

- The Challenge

**Hand-authored bios work best** because they:

- Capture what makes each person unique to ERA
- Integrate professional background with ERA engagement
- Reflect actual contributions and interests discussed in Town Halls
- Avoid generic LinkedIn summary language

**Sources of information:**

1. **LinkedIn profiles** (provided by user) ‚Üí Professional background.  ADAPT THESE WHEN POSSIBLE
2. **Town Hall participation** (from Fathom database) ‚Üí Meeting attendance, engagement
3. **Town Hall and ** (era_townhalls_complete.md) ‚Üí What they said, context, interests
   1. if that is inadequate, there are often other fathom recordings with rich conversations.
4. **Email search** (user's email) ‚Üí Contact info (email, phone), affiliated organizations, background
5. **Airtable member data** (existing records) ‚Üí Current affiliations, projects, notes

---

## Approach: Intelligent Assistant Pattern

Following the participant_reconciliation model:

**Human-AI Collaboration:**

1. AI identifies members needing profiles (SEE BELOW)
2. Human provides LinkedIn URLs for batch of members (SEE BELOW.  When Linkedin profile is lacking we need further resarch)
3. FUrther research Read LinkedIn profile
   - Search Town Hall and other transcripts for mentions
   - Search user's email for contact info, org affiliations, background
   - Query Fathom database for participation details
4. AI compiles research notes with sources.  Insert them in line in this document, including responses to my queries.
5. AI drafts complete profile updates:
   - Bio (personalized, contextual - not generic summaries)
   - Email address (from email search or existing data)
   - Phone number (if found in email)
   - Affiliated organizations (from email, LinkedIn, or existing data)
6. Human reviews, edits, approves
   1. we will do these iteratively.  Every time we iterate you will create a NEW numbered version of this document.  Augmented as requested and removing one that I say are ready for inclusion in the database or removed because of other directions I give.  For those, you will add them thoughtfully to the database.

      Eventually there will be no members left.
7. **THIS IS NOT automated profile generation** - This is collaborative curation with AI providing:

- Multi-source synthesis (LinkedIn + TH context + email correspondence)
- Pattern recognition (similar members, common themes)
- Draft generation for human refinement
- Contact info extraction from email

---

## Key Principles

**1. Context-Rich Bios**

- NOT: BLIND Generic LinkedIn summary copy-paste
- YES:  Curated for consistency of Tone and relevance to ERA.

**2. Prioritization**

* **act on those where action is clear.  insert questions for those where you don't know what to do**

**3. Human Oversight**

- AI collects data, drafts Bios, human edits and approves every bio, AI learns from the process and improves.
- 

**4. Quality Over Speed**

- Intelligent Solutions via Intelligence not via scripts.
- Thoughtful, personalized bios
- Multiple source synthesis
- Reflect actual ERA engagement

## Data Sources

**Airtable:** `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/airtable/people_export.csv. `

- We are using Airtable for information but not writing to it at the moment.

**Database:** `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/FathomInventory/fathom_emails.db`

**Town Hall Transcripts:** `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/fathom/output/era_townhalls_complete.md`

- Complete transcripts of all Town Halls
- Search for mentions, contributions, questions, context

**Email Archive:** (user's email - Gmail search)

- Contact info (email addresses, phone numbers)
- Affiliated organizations mentioned in correspondence
- Background context, introductions, conversations
- **Access via:** Gmail API or search tools (to be determined)

**LinkedIn:** (provided by user)

- Professional background
- Current position, education
- Organizations, skills, interests

---

## Process

### Phase 1.  AI: Read this document, ask questions,

1. To facilitate my navigation using the sidebar outline,  organiza heading. so that we have Three H1 headings:  Summary, Context, and Members Without Bios
   Each Member name is H2, with subordinate H3s for

   * Bio (draft, if any)
   * Fields [bullet list of field names and values from Database: Email, Phone, Affiliated Organizations (populated in part from this ongoing research)]
   * Notes. Information concisley curated as requrested.

## Phase 2: Multi-Source Research (AI):

For each member flagged as NEXT, you will populate the fields

1. Read LinkedIn profile (professional background)
2. Query Town Hall participation from Fathom database
3. Search era_townhalls_complete.md for mentions, contributions
4. Search user's email for:
   - Email address
   - Phone number
   - Affiliated organizations
   - Background context, introductions
5. Review existing Airtable data
6. Synthesize into contextual research notes with sources

### Update Complete profile when marked APPROVED:

Generate complete profile updates:

- **Bio:** 2-3 sentences, personalized
  - Lead with professional background (from LinkedIn)
  - Integrate ERA context (from Town Halls)
  - Highlight contributions/interests
- **Email:** From email search or existing data
- **Phone:** If found in email correspondence
- **Affiliated Orgs:** From email, LinkedIn, or existing data

## Success Metrics

**Immediate Goal:**

- Profiles enriched.
- Fields updated: Bio, Email, Phone (where available), Affiliated Orgs
- Quality: Human-reviewed and edited each field
- Context integration: LinkedIn + TH transcripts + other conversations +  email correspondence
- Ready for publication: Profiles complete, awaiting manual "Publish" activation

**Quality Criteria:**

- Contact info is accurate and sourced
- Affiliated orgs reflect current/relevant organizations. [Collect these as you edit.]
- 

**Pattern to follow:**

- AI proposes, human edits, AI disposes
- Iterative process with numbered versions of this document.
- Thoughtful, intelligence evidence-rich outputs (links to sources)
- Learn from corrections

**George Sendero**

- Affiliation: For the Oceans Foundation
- Bio:

  Board Member - Chief Executive Officer

  Jorge Serendero as former Costa Rican Sea Shepherd Conservation director has played different operational and organizational roles in campaigns in Coco‚Äôs Island and other biological corridor areas of the Pacific. He also was leading the PR and communications team that released Captain Paul Watson from criminal charges in Costa Rica, together with Sea Shepherds Lawyer, Abraham Stern. Thanks to his thorough works he was able to detect and fully understand the need to protect marine sanctuaries from Costa Rica to Ecuador, at the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor including the South Pacific. These marine habitats are seriously threatened by large foreign fleets of illegal fishing, such as the Chinese fleet with hundreds of factory boats, extracting wildlife indiscriminately without giving migrant populations and species the opportunity to reproduce. In addition to being the CEO of For the Oceans Foundation, Jorge Serendero also directs the ‚ÄúFront for the Protected Wild Areas‚Äù, as a permanent advisory organization linked to the Ministry of the Environment of Costa Rica and SINAC, the National System of Conservation Areas.

## Next Steps

1. **Scrape LinkedIn profiles** for the 1 members with URLs
2. **Manual LinkedIn search** for the 61 members without URLs
3. Use email domains and affiliations as search hints
4. Check Airtable for additional LinkedIn URLs not yet in database
