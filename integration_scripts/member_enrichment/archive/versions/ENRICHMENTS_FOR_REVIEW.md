_[No bio draft yet]_

**Complete Bio Created (all italicized in V6):**
*Mtokani Saleh Amisi is a Congolese refugee based in Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya, originally from Pongodiarasi in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He arrived at Kakuma in 2010 as a child and completed his primary and secondary education there, making Kakuma his home for over 14 years. Despite displacement challenges and ongoing conflict affecting his home region, he founded Agri-Hope Initiative Foundation, a community-based organization focused on empowering youth through agriculture, transforming lives, and cultivating prosperity within the refugee community. The organization addresses the critical challenge that 90% of refugee youth face limited opportunities after completing their education, by creating agricultural training and employment pathways. Mtokani was referred to ERA Africa by Ananda Fitzsimmons and participates actively, bringing a powerful perspective on how regenerative agriculture can create resilience, hope, and self-sufficiency even in refugee contexts.*

**Already marked APPROVED in V6** (was APPROVED before this session)

**Note Added (italicized in V6):**
*A "Joshua Laizer" from Arusha, Tanzania appears in ERA Africa transcripts (based in northern Tanzania, participates in ERA Africa coordination).

Both have "Laizer" in their names and are from Tanzania, but caution against conflation without evidence.*
