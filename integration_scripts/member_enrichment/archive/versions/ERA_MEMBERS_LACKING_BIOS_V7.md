# Context

## Purpose

Complete member onboarding by enriching profiles and bios, preparing for public directory publication.

## ERA Member Definition

**CRITICAL:** A person is an ERA member if and only if:

1. They attended a Town Hall meeting (introduced, no objections, week passed), OR
2. Special decision from Jon Schull

**The database contains non-members.** We must verify Town Hall attendance before treating someone as a member.

## The ERA Onboarding Process

When someone becomes an ERA member:

1. ‚úÖ **NOW:** Update profile in Database (Bio, email, phone, affiliated organizations)
2. **LATER:** Publish in public directory
3. **LATER:** Add to ERA Landscape visualization
4. **LATER:** Send welcome email (+ invite to become supporting member)
5. **LATER:** Add to Google Groups mailing lists

**Reality:** We've been sloppy. There's a backlog.

## Immediate Scope

**This integration focuses on steps 1-2:**

1. **Complete profiles** for members who attended Town Halls
   - Bios (contextual, personalized)
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers (where available)
   - Affiliated organizations
2. **Prepare for public directory publication** (human activates "Publish" field)

## Why Hand-Authored Bios

**Hand-authored bios work best** because they:

- Capture what makes each person unique to ERA
- Integrate professional background with ERA engagement
- Reflect actual contributions and interests discussed in Town Halls
- Avoid generic LinkedIn summary language

## Information Sources

1. **LinkedIn profiles** ‚Üí Professional background (ADAPT when possible, don't copy-paste)
2. **Town Hall participation** (Fathom database) ‚Üí Meeting attendance, engagement
3. **Town Hall transcripts** (era_townhalls_complete.md) ‚Üí What they said, context, interests
4. **Other Fathom recordings** ‚Üí When Town Hall context is inadequate
5. **Email search** (user's email) ‚Üí Contact info, affiliated organizations, background
6. **Airtable** (people_export.csv) ‚Üí Existing affiliations, projects, notes

## Approach: Intelligent Assistant Pattern

Following the participant_reconciliation model for **Human-AI Collaboration:**

1. AI identifies members needing profiles
2. Human provides LinkedIn URLs and flags members as "NEXT"
3. AI conducts multi-source research:
   - Read LinkedIn profile
   - Search Town Hall and other transcripts for mentions
   - Search user's email for contact info, org affiliations, background
   - Query Fathom database for participation details
4. AI compiles research notes with sources **inline in this document**
5. AI drafts complete profile updates:
   - Bio (personalized, contextual - not generic summaries)
   - Email address (from email search or existing data)
   - Phone number (if found in email)
   - Affiliated organizations (from email, LinkedIn, or existing data)
6. Human reviews, edits, approves (marks "APPROVED")
7. AI updates database for approved profiles
8. AI creates new numbered version removing completed members

**Eventually there will be no members left.**

## Procedural Guidelines

### 1. LinkedIn Profile Harvesting

- AI initiates rate-limit-aware scraping (10-15 second delays)
- Runs in background, monitored periodically
- Creates batch files with scraped profiles

### 2. Document Versioning

- Each iteration creates new numbered version: `...V2.md`, `...V3.md`, etc.
- Completed members are removed the NEXT VERSION OF THE  document when marked APPROVED
- Document versions shrink each iteration until empty

### 3. Member Verification

- Database contains non-members
- MUST verify Town Hall attendance before treating as member
- Remove flagged non-members immediately (with documentation)

### 4. Quality Control

- AI proposes, human edits, AI updates database
- No "bad apples" - fix issues permanently so they don't resurface
- Document fixes in PAST_LEARNINGS.md

### 5. Data Preservation

- When removing members, document WHY
- Database corrections (spelling, case, merges) done immediately
- All changes tracked AND REVERTABLE

## Key Principles

**1. Context-Rich Bios**

- NOT: Generic LinkedIn summary copy-paste
- YES: Curated for consistency of tone and relevance to ERA

**2. Prioritization**

- Act on those where action is clear
- Insert questions for those where you don't know what to do
- Human flags members as "NEXT" for AI to research

**3. Human Oversight**

- AI collects data, drafts bios
- Human edits and approves every bio
- AI learns from the process and improves

**4. Quality Over Speed**

- Intelligent solutions via intelligence, not scripts
- Thoughtful, personalized bios
- Multiple source synthesis
- Reflect actual ERA engagement

## Document Structure

For sidebar navigation, this document uses:

- **H1:** Summary, Context, Members Without Bios
- **H2:** Each member name (only H2 in sidebar for easy navigation)
- **Member sections:** Bio, Fields, Notes (bolded, not headers)
