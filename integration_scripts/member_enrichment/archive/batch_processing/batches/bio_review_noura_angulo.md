## APPROVED BIO

Noura Angulo is a senior at Barnard College majoring in political science and statistics, where she serves as an Empirical Reasoning Fellow and Senior Editor of the Columbia Political Review. Based in Washington, D.C., she brings quantitative research skills—including R, Stata, GIS, and SQL—to her work exploring the intersection of policy, data, and ecological restoration. Her research experience spans political communication (investigating TikTok algorithms and political news knowledge with Columbia faculty), social science methodology (Civic Health Project), and global migration issues (Georgetown Day School Policy Institute). Noura joined ERA in 2024 during an internship with Biodiversity for a Livable Climate, where she discovered connections between political science, empirical reasoning, and ecosystem restoration, bringing a student perspective on how data-driven approaches can inform environmental policy and community engagement.
