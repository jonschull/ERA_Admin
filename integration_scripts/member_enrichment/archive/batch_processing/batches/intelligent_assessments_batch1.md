### Questions for Human Review
1. Should we mention "cowboy hats" in the bio or keep it general "SunBody Inc"?

### Questions for Human Review
1. Should we mark him as ERA Member = Yes? He attended TH and was engaged.
2. Bio emphasizes philosophy - is this too abstract or appropriately reflective?
3. Should we mention his "create a bigger problem" teaching directly?

From Jon Schull's testimony:

> "Celia Francis, formerly head of Art of the Forest, but now... CEO of Ponterra which is responsible for a 70 million dollar reforestation project in Panama... they're currently doing I think 10,000 acres, but they hope to do an order of magnitude more. They're focusing on carbon credits and mixed reforestry... looking to understand the larger system... not doing much in the way of science so there's an opportunity for collaboration on the hydrological and climatological implications."

**Key facts:**
- Previously: Head of Art of the Forest (global organization)
- Currently: CEO & Co-Founder of Ponterra
- Project scale: $70M reforestation in Panama
- Current: 10,000 acres, goal: 100,000+ acres

- Looking for: Scientific collaboration on hydrological/climate impacts
- ERA member & donor (database confirms)

### Proposed Bio
"Celia Francis is CEO and Co-Founder of Ponterra, leading a $70 million reforestation initiative in Panama. Formerly head of Art of the Forest, she brings global expertise in ecosystem restoration to her current work with landholders on mixed reforestation and carbon sequestration. An ERA member and donor, Celia seeks scientific collaboration on the hydrological and climatological implications of large-scale reforestation."

### Proposed Airtable Updates
- **Bio:** [as above]
- **Email:** celia@ponterra.eco ✅ (already correct)
- **Phone:** [none found]
- **Affiliated Orgs:** Ponterra, Art of the Forest (check if present)
- **Database affiliation correction:** Change "Pantera" → "Ponterra"
- **Publish:** Already True - ready to publish once bio added

### Questions for Human Review
1. Should we mention the "10,000 acres → 100,000 acres" goal specifically?
2. "Looking for scientific collaboration" - is this too specific/dated (from 2024 TH)?
3. Should we emphasize "donor" status in bio or keep professional focus?

## BATCH SUMMARY

**Success rate:** 3/3 LinkedIn matches verified ✅

**Common patterns observed:**
1. Database affiliation is generally accurate but sometimes abbreviated (Regenesis) or has typos (Pantera)
2. LinkedIn provides current official titles/positions
3. Town Hall transcripts provide EXCELLENT context on:
   - Their own self-descriptions
   - Others' testimonials about them
   - Their interests and ERA engagement
4. Email domains often confirm organization affiliations

**Recommendations for next batch:**
- Prioritize members with Town Hall transcript mentions (rich context)
- Always cross-check database affiliation spelling with email domain
- Look for testimonials from others (Jon, Philip) not just self-descriptions

**Ready for human review.**
