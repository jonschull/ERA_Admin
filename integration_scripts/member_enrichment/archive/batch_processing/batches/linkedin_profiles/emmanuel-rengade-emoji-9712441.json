And perhaps that\u2019s not such a bad thing. Perhaps there's another, better way.\n\nIt was always hard to believe anyway that it could truly \u201cwin.\u201d That the well-intentioned few could sway the unconscious majority. Eventually, what seemed like good ideas\u2014planting trees, electric cars, renewable energy\u2014wasn\u2019t really working at the end: most trees don\u2019t survive if you don\u2019t nurture them, electric cars create another issues with batteries, etc. Ecological change seemed more intentional and peripheral than real. \n\nAt some point, we must admit that the narrative became frustrating\u2014heavy with guilt, tinged with hopelessness, and dominated by the language of fear. A vision of the future defined not by possibility, but by \u201cpoints of no return.\u201d \n\nBut if we believe our thoughts shape our reality\u2014why are we continuing to create this one? \n\nIt may be time for a different approach. Not a war between \u201cgood ecologists\u201d and \u201cbad polluters\u201d. Not guilt or blame, but collective responsibility. We can elevate ourselves and see from a wiser perspective. \n\nA new path is emerging\u2014one that reconciles ecological awareness with deeper truths about healing, oneness, and our shared humanity.\n\n We can make the choice to responsibly self-actualize our ecological opinions to something more joyful and real, and that can bring true change.\n \nAncient and indigenous wisdom traditions have pointed to this all along: The Earth\u2019s collapse mirrors the collapse of the human spirit. \n\nOur thoughts are creative forces. They can lead to destruction\u2014or harmony. If we truly want to heal the Earth, we must first heal what we\u2019ve lost within ourselves.\n\nThat means reconnecting with values that are not only humanistic, but spiritual. It suggests that ecology, as central and essential as it may have seemed to us, might in fact be just a path toward a deeper rediscovery: our connection with the Earth. Or shall we say to be more precise: our love for the Earth, and the love of the Earth for us.\n\nAnd this is good news, because love speaks higher than any ism.\nBeyond ideology. Beyond partisanship. Rooted in truth, simplicity, and presence. \n\nWhen we stop projecting blame and instead turn inward, we connect with something essential and inexpressable with words and mind. Unity. Coherence. \n\nEcology is but a path to Love: let\u2019s really cross that bridge.\n\nAnd from there, right action emerges\u2014not as obligation, but as a natural flow.\n\nIt\u2019s time to go deeper into nature. Not just physically\u2014but consciously.\n With openness. With humility. With the courage to change the way we see the world.\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n4\n2 comments\nEmmanuel Rengade \ud83c\udf0e reposted this\nThais Corral\nThais Corral\n \u2022 2nd\n2nd\nFounder and Director, Instituto Sinal do Vale.

Ambos me tocaram profundamente pela sua beleza, coer\u00eancia e prop\u00f3sito. Assim como o SINAL do Vale, s\u00e3o muito mais do que hospedagens ou empreendimentos. S\u00e3o territ\u00f3rios vivos \u2014 lugares que acolhem, regeneram e mostram um outro caminho poss\u00edvel para o nosso futuro coletivo.\n\nVivemos tempos em que a reconex\u00e3o com a natureza n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais um luxo, mas uma necessidade vital. Como t\u00e3o bem exp\u00f5e o artigo da iniciativa We Are Nature \u2014 \u201c7 reasons why we need places in nature\u201d \u2014 esses espa\u00e7os:\nrestauram nossa sa\u00fade f\u00edsica e emocional,\nresgatam a sabedoria do tempo natural,\ninspiram novas formas de viver, produzir e liderar.\nLugares como Catu\u00e7aba, Picinguaba e SINAL do Vale s\u00e3o sementes de um futuro regenerativo. Eles nos lembram que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel viver em harmonia com a Terra, gerar impacto positivo e ao mesmo tempo criar experi\u00eancias transformadoras para pessoas, comunidades e organiza\u00e7\u00f5es. Precisamos fortalecer essa rede de territ\u00f3rios regenerativos \u2014 conectando pr\u00e1ticas, saberes, solu\u00e7\u00f5es e narrativas. Eles s\u00e3o pontos de transi\u00e7\u00e3o entre o modelo que est\u00e1 colapsando e o mundo que queremos construir.\n\nMais do que nunca, o planeta precisa de lugares assim. E n\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m. \ud83c\udf3f\n\nPlaces that Heal, Inspire and Regenerate! \nLast week, I had the joy of visiting two extraordinary places: Catu\u00e7aba and Picinguaba \u2013 We Are Nature. Both touched me deeply \u2014 not only for their natural beauty, but for the coherence and purpose that permeate every detail. Like SINAL do Vale, these are not just hospitality ventures. They are living sanctuaries \u2014 places that welcome, regenerate, and show us another possible path for our shared future.\nIn our times, reconnection with nature is no longer a luxury \u2014 it is a vital need. As beautifully expressed in We Are Nature's article \u201c7 reasons why we need places in nature\u201d, these spaces:\nrestore our physical and emotional well-being,\nreconnect us with the wisdom of natural time,\ninspire new ways of living, producing, and leading.\nPlaces like Catu\u00e7aba, Picinguaba, and SINAL do Vale are seeds of a regenerative future. They remind us that it is possible to live in harmony with the Earth, generate positive impact, and create meaningful, transformative experiences for people, communities, and organizations.\n\ud83c\udf0d Now is the time to strengthen this network of regenerative territories \u2014 to connect practices, knowledge, solutions, and stories. These places are not isolated experiments: they are gateways between a collapsing system and the world we know is possible.\nMore than ever, the planet needs places like these. And so do we.\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n46\n3 comments\n1 repost\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nFounder\nFounder\nFounder\nFazenda Catucaba, Brazil\nFazenda Catucaba, Brazil\nDec 2008 - Present \u00b7 16 yrs 11 mos\nDec 2008 to Present \u00b7 16 yrs 11 mos\nSao Paulo\nSao Paulo\nFazenda Catu\u00e7aba is a laboratory where a number of achievements were accomplished over the past few years, including the first Platinum LEED certified eco-house in South America, the first Oca (Indian House) built by indigenous people outside the Amazon, the fist Art Gallery away from the cities in Brazil, all landmark structures for new times that are being used for workshops, exhibitions, events, and direct experience of a new way of living. \n\nOur work involves getting back to the origins.
