Becoming a biologist has been a dream of mine since childhood, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful to finally take this next step. I\u2019m excited to learn and grow in this role, and to contribute to the important work of protecting Florida\u2019s unique wildlife and ecosystems.\n\nThank you to all the mentors, colleagues, and organizations who have guided and supported me along the way.
