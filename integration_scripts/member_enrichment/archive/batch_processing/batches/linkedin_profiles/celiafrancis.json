You spoke so beautifully about Mexico\u2019s commitment to nature and restoration. It was an honour to meet you.

The energy and ambition in the room reflected how far we\u2019ve come, and how much potential there is ahead.\n\nThank you to Sophie Winwood, Anisah Osman Britton MBE, and Pallavi Jayashankar, and the whole Unlock team, for creating such a thoughtful space for founders and investors to connect.\n\nUmaima Malik Ahmad, Veronica Kirin, Marta Krupinska, Charlene LIN, Nicole Tingle, Alicia S., Annie Gilchrist, Alice Ivanoff-Boardman, Emily Mu, Chloe So, Katie Marsh, Friederike Edmunds, Alexa Bruce, Litzi U., Czuee Morey, Ph.D., Lauren (Ladd) Englehart, Anna Mu\u00f1oz Farr\u00e9\n\n74\n2 comments\nPost\nPost\nWow.

Start by Becoming a Cattle Farmer.\nwsj.com\n4\nPost\nPost\nLast week we were thrilled to announce that Ponterra, Microsoft, Rubicon Carbon, and Carbon Streaming Corporation have closed a landmark deal to fully finance our flagship biodiversity restoration project, Ponterra's Restaura Azuero Project (ARC) in \nhashtag\n#Panama.\n\n\ud83c\udf32 The ARC Project will reforest 10,000 hectares (twice the size of Manhattan!) of degraded tropical forest in Panama, removing 3.24 million tonnes of CO2 by planting 6 million trees using 75 native species. \n\n\ud83c\udf33 In addition to the carbon sequestration, the project will bring back biodiversity (including the Azuero Spider Monkey) on land degraded by cattle ranching to one of the most important ecological regions in the world.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 By combining upfront investment over a 30 year contract and long term offtake through 2040, we are bringing a first-of-a-kind deal to the market to prove out the \"nature carbon-as-infrastructure\" investment thesis. \n\n\ud83d\udd26 There is no path to preserving our planet's biodiversity or meeting the 1.5C maths without the VCM.\n\n\ud83d\udc65 The ARC project is under validation with the new VM0047 Verra ARR standard to meet many of the ten key integrity requirements that we have heard from carbon credit buyers (more about these ten in future posts). \n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Verra has selected the Project to participate in its new Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta) Nature Framework program.\n\n\ud83c\udf33The ARC project will leave over $70M with the Azuero community over the next 30 years.\n\nGratitude for the people who made this dream a reality:\n\n\ud83d\ude4f Our fantastic partners at Microsoft, Rubicon, and Carbon Streaming who have been unwavering in their support of Ponterra.\n\n\ud83c\udf33 The Pro Eco Azuero team who teach kids in the region about the importance of forests for the animals and plants of the region to thrive.
