Project development.\n3mo \u2022 \n \n3 months ago \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nHere at the Joseph Rock Arboretum in Hawaii we try to be very thoughtful about waste. One thing that we do is to use all of the cardboard from boxes to plant our seedlings in the field. We have a machine that perforates the cardboard and we use it around the seedlings. \n\nYou can see it around this sandalwood seedling. It keeps the weeds suppressed, keeps the soil cool around the young plant, and the worms like it. It finally breaks down. I also shred my paper in the office so my paper waste is very low.\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n40\n4 comments\n1 repost\nByamukama Nyansio\nByamukama Nyansio\n \u2022 1st\n1st\nTHE MINDSET VILLAGE WALK\nTHE MINDSET VILLAGE WALK\n3mo \u2022 \n \n3 months ago \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nBefore the last bee dies, let us act now to find what causes our bees to reduce at a such percentage.\nJohn Roulac\nJohn Roulac\n \u2022 1st\n1st\nFounder & CEO Coco Clean\nFounder & CEO Coco Clean\nComplete Big Pesticide Propaganda BS \n\nThe complete premise is absurd \u201cscientist finally identified the culprit\u201c.
