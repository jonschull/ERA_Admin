I have served and continue to serve as the hydraulic engineering specialist on many parts of the ongoing Bonnybrook WWTP upgrades in Calgary. I also have a profound professional interest in advancing the state of the art in hydraulic engineering design. Recent project successes include leveraging my experience in advanced WWTP hydraulic engineering into the field of stormwater treatment where a more rigorous design process can yield much higher functioning systems without any extra cost.\nI have 15 years of experience as an advanced hydraulic systems engineering designer and analyst.
