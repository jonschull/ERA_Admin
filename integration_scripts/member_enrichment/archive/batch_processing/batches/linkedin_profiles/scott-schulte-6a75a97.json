When it\u2019s compared to regions across the country, it's in an enviable position because its quality of life is high and backed by strong neighborhoods, a solid economy, and low cost of living. Still, the region faces serious socio-economic disparities (areas of concentrated poverty and housing segregation) and challenges (projected major demographic shifts) that will test the region\u2019s resiliency. Community leaders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors are already taking steps through Heartland 2050, the Omaha/Council Bluff\u2019s region\u2019s first regional vision plan, to connect its more vulnerable communities to educational and economic opportunities. Residents want to ensure that the region continues to thrive and becomes a place where people of all walks of life have the opportunity to live, work, play and contribute. \nBy 2050 the population in the Omaha/Council Bluffs region is projected to nearly double.
