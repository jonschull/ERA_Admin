Despite a challenging terrain and climate, thanks to its strong cycling culture, riding for teens has become both a rite of passage and a practical necessity.\n\nCycling is deeply woven into the fabric of daily life in Matsuyama. The street layout makes it a nimble and efficient mode during rush hour. Public transport exists, but for many students, the bike means not relying on schedules or transfers, and being able to take shortcuts through quieter streets.\n\nProving hills and rain are always weak excuses instead of actual barriers, the morning rush is a tidal wave of cyclists, thanks to the fact there are dedicated bike lanes on many roads, and it is permissible to ride on sidewalks on others. Secure parking can also be found everywhere across the city.\n\nMany of these efforts were led by Prefecture Governor Tokihiro Nakamura, who in 2016 formed a public-private partnership called the Promotion of a New Ehime Bicycle Culture Association that strives to \"foster health, purpose in life, and friendship\", through special events and stimulation campaigns.\n\nFor teenagers in Matsuyama, cycling embodies freedom, independence, and resilience in the face of adversity. Rather than rely on parents to drive them from A to B, they are moving safely, happily, and healthily on their own terms. And cities everywhere should be inspired to help theirs do the same.\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/20\nActivate to view larger image,\n559\n24 comments\n49 reposts\nAbigail Castle reposted this\nCenter for Biological Diversity\nCenter for Biological Diversity\n143,257 followers\n143,257 followers\n2mo \u2022 \n \n2 months ago \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nPart of what\ud83d\udc1e bugs\ud83e\udeb2 us about the extinction crisis?\n\nThe possibility of losing so many of our insect friends to things like pollution, pesticides, habitat destruction and climate change.\n\nInsects are incredible. It\u2019s impossible to overstate their importance in keeping ecosystems and humans healthy and functioning. Yet sadly, insects are declining across the globe.\n\nWe are pushing so many ecosystems beyond the point of recovery, resulting in insect extinctions. These declines lead to loss of essential, irreplaceable services to humanity \u2014 from pollination and decomposition and more.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nLearn more about the extinction crisis and how we're working to halt it at SaveLifeOnEarth.org\n\u2026more\n\n257\n11 comments\n48 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\n4-H Afterschool Program Educator\n4-H Afterschool Program Educator\nCornell Cooperative Extension of Jefferson County \u00b7 Part-time\nCornell Cooperative Extension of Jefferson County \u00b7 Part-time\nAug 2025 -
