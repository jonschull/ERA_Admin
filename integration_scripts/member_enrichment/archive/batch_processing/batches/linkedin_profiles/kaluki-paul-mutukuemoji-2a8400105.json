I set up Earth Now Media as a decentralised digital studio to inform, impact and influence how we shape narratives, and therefore how the narratives can usher in a new wave of solidarity, trust building and enhancing community leadership in driving diverse solutions.

Opportunity after another opening for me, just because I made the difficult & daring decision to bring this vision to life, most times using the small finances at my disposal and leveraging the power of the intentional community that has been supportive of my journey.\n\nJust this June, I had the absolute rare pleasure to host the former vice president of the USA, Al Gore, Founder & Chairman of The Climate Reality Project. Al Gore has done incredible work\u00a0in influencing climate action and investments for years. He has been a loud voice on what has to be done amidst the polycrisis.\n\nSo, when I got a formal invitation to host Al Gore at the Climate Reality's Nairobi tour Training, I was met with so many feelings, but one particular feeling was that I had to say a big YES, and to deliver this event in a stellar moderation and hosting that befits the occasion. And tell you what, even I was surprised that I could host and moderate a full day's programming, with humour, fun, scientific facts, and my own lived experiences in climate justice and environmental leadership. Of course, I've hosted events and moderated forums before, but this one felt different, due to it's intergenerational nature and scope regarding climate leadership. \n\nI am grateful to God, and to every person who has gone before me, believed in my capabilities and actually trusted me to deliver some good magic for their events and programs. And to the climate reality global and regional families, most especially the team behind the Nairobi training, a very big thank you for the honour of bringing out in me this\u00a0\u200bnot-so-new skill after all. I hope to continue learning, growing and thriving in the space, and delivering high-level, real & dignified hosting and moderation.\n\nTo add a cherry on top of the cake, I am officially a trained climate reality leader.\u00a0Thanks so much The Climate Reality Project African Climate Reality Project Climate Reality Canada | R\u00e9alit\u00e9 climatique Canada Climate Reality Leadership Corps for this \ud83d\ude4c.\n\nIt was an honour to share the space and host key leaders across the continent and globally, ranging from Wanjira Mathai, Rebekah Shirley, Ph.D., Yvonne Nyokabi Gachugi - Nzomo, Ali Modammed Office of Kenya's Special Envoy for Climate Change, Omar Elmawi Rayah Ahmed, Dr Ezekiel, Phyllis Cuttino, ChezaCheza Dance Foundation & the wealth of climate leaders tuning in >700, thronging the venue across the day.\n\nFor you who may have doubted what this stubborn optimist + proud son of the Afrikan soil can do, this is your cue to give me that gig & let me show you how it's done. I'll bring you a fresh perspective & an authentic host personality that will spark more conversations towards solutions.\n \nA luta continua\u270a\ud83c\udffe\ud83c\udf0d\u2728\ufe0f\ud83c\udf31\n459\n93 comments\nLink\nLink\nEarth Now Media - Subscribe & join our growing community \nEarth Now Media - Subscribe & join our growing community \nYouTube\nYouTube\nLink\nLink\nClimate Change: Why Kenya & The World Must Do Better - Kaluki Paul Mutuku\nClimate Change: Why Kenya & The World Must Do Better - Kaluki Paul Mutuku\nYouTube\nYouTube\nPost\nPost\n\u2728\ufe0f\ud83d\udd4aFinishing the Good Fight! \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd\n\nMonths back in 2023, INUKA Afrika_ launched as a pilot accelerator project for youth leaders working on Nature-based Solutions (NbS) projects in their communities, and at landscape level. Our aim: to make a case on how NbS can truly work for biodiversity, communities and livelihoods \n\nThrough undertaking well designed INUKA curriculum trainings, we went across different landscapes and communities, training, learning with and mentoring the youth in INUKA project, skilling and building their capacities to enhance their landscapes and seascapes restoration works, build stronger communities and develop a legacy for youth-led restoration, and set stage for Afrika and Global Youth restoration leadership. \n\nSo last week I had the honor to witness what I started as a dream, an ambitious project ideation in 2020, see its final impact training on NbS in Agriculture and Impact storytelling, and of course having the honor to lead and deliver the trainings has been worthwhile. These trainings have inspired me to keep going, even as I continue to mentor and Nurture more youth leaders in restoration \n\nFind my reflections in the comments section below but in summary I mention; lessons learnt, intentional partnerships, funding youth and communities, Design thinking in project development, and Media role in communicating impact.\n\nI can say a lot but for now, I want to say it has been real serving in this capacity. The works has INUKA Afrika, an authentic project that puts resources, skills and practice in young people and their communities, to transform themselves and restore their landscapes and seascapes. I will remain available as the Visionary and advisor for this and many other impact projects for youth, in Afrika \ud83c\udf0d and indeed across the world \ud83c\udf0e. To my fellow trainers, partners and support systems, blessings in all you do!\n\nI am moving on to my next big thing in Afrika, and I leave my staff role at Youth4Nature as a proud son of the Afrikan soil. Afrika is my pride, and I shall always challenge the status quo so as to get authentic narratives into the world. Thanks for all funding support from ClimateWorks Foundation, this work has been made possible in immense ways \u2728\ufe0f\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc9a\n\nLastly, I will continue to offer Consultancies in Nature-based Solutions (NbS), Impact Storytelling, Advocacy and Community Development.
