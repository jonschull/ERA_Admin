Adept at working with smallholder farmers, community-based organizations, local stakeholders, and multilateral donors to advance sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity, and regenerative practices.

Pollution in Lake Victoria and its surroundings is driven by the lack of sanitation in Kampala's informal settlements and toxic nutrient loading from fertilizer run-off. I'm working with local organizations, waste researchers, farmers, and environmental activists to promote composting and container-based sanitation through skills training, advocacy, value-chain development, and stakeholder engagement. We're creating jobs in the circular economy and seeding innovation to scale nutrient recovery for the production of locally-produced organic fertilizers, and helping informal service providers gain access to stakeholders in the WASH sector. \n\nMy doctoral research examines the many perplexing facets of the global sanitation crisis, from the wicked problem of \"human waste\" and waste treatment to water pollution, food sovereignty, environmental degradation, and carbon/climate finance policies. We can repair metabolic rifts by recycling nutrients and improving microbial soil health, so why aren't countries recycling these valuable nutrients in excreta at scale?\n\nCalifornia has an invisible waste crisis. I'm working with Ryan Smith and the County of Santa Cruz to pilot the first CBS project in the state. We're also collaborating with similar waterless sanitation initiatives in Mendocino, New Mexico, and Nevada where septic systems are too costly to build, and wastewater infrastructure is lacking.\nStrategic leader with 25+ years of experience designing and scaling international development programs for climate-resilient agriculture, WASH, and food security.

A shared trust between people, planet, and purpose. Aqua Vitae calls for a movement, where governments uphold the right to water, communities lead through STEWARDSHIP, and faith TRADITIONS remind us that water is SACRED. When LAW meets FAITH, JUSTICE flows and living water finds its way HOME.\n\nLet\u2019s rethink how we value water. Let\u2019s defend water and in doing so, defend life itself.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Read the full article https://lnkd.in/dQ_vTFM7\n\nWorld Communion of Reformed Churches World Council of Churches RIVERS OF LIVING WATER FAITH FELLOWSHIP Kenya National Association of Water Resources Users' Associations (KeNAWRUA) GreenFaith \n\n \nhashtag\n#WaterJustice \nhashtag\n#EnvironmentalStewardship\n\u2026more\nAqua Vitae.\nEnock Ole Kiminta \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddea\n5\n1 comment\n1 repost\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nPHD Candidate - Cultural Anthropology\nPHD Candidate - Cultural Anthropology\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz \u00b7 Full-time\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz \u00b7 Full-time\nOct 2023 - Present \u00b7 2 yrs 1 mo\nOct 2023 to Present \u00b7 2 yrs 1 mo\nExecutive Director\nExecutive Director\nExecutive Director\nGiveLove.org \u2014 WASH & Waste2Resource East Africa \u00b7 Full-time\nGiveLove.org \u2014 WASH & Waste2Resource East Africa \u00b7 Full-time\nFeb 2010 - Present \u00b7 15 yrs 9 mos\nFeb 2010 to Present \u00b7 15 yrs 9 mos\nUnited States and Kampala, Uganda\nUnited States and Kampala, Uganda\nWASH sector expert focused on promoting WASH accessibility, waste2resource recycling, climate resilience, sustainable development, and Global Health (13 years).\nWASH sector expert focused on promoting WASH accessibility, waste2resource recycling, climate resilience, sustainable development, and Global Health (13 years).\nCapacity Building, Technical Skills Training and +11 skills\nFounder & CEO\nFounder & CEO\nFounder & CEO\nScout Enterprises\nScout Enterprises\nSep 2002 - Nov 2009 \u00b7 7 yrs 3 mos\nSep 2002 to Nov 2009 \u00b7 7 yrs 3 mos\nSanta Cruz, California\nSanta Cruz, California\nFounder of fair trade business to support women-run shea butter producers and local conservation of woodland biodiversity in Uganda through credit, marketing, value-added processing, and value-chain development. \n\n\u2022 Created 25 value-added products and marketing collateral for domestic & international markets. \n\u2022 Coordinated production, quality control, logistics, and exports from Uganda.\nFounder of fair trade business to support women-run shea butter producers and local conservation of woodland biodiversity in Uganda through credit, marketing, value-added processing, and value-chain development. \u2022 Created 25 value-added products and marketing collateral for domestic & international markets. \u2022 Coordinated production, quality control, logistics, and exports from Uganda.\nNonprofit Organizations\nCo-founder & Program Officer\nCo-founder & Program Officer\nCo-founder & Program Officer\nCOVOL UGANDA \u00b7 Full-time\nCOVOL UGANDA \u00b7 Full-time\nJun 1989 - Sep 2002 \u00b7 13 yrs 4 mos\nJun 1989 to Sep 2002 \u00b7 13 yrs 4 mos\nUganda\nUganda\nServed as Program Officer for three consecutive USAID-funded cooperative agreements that promoted food security and strengthened local conservation in northern Uganda \u2014 The Shea Project for Local Conservation and Development; and DERO: the Northern Uganda Food Security Project.
