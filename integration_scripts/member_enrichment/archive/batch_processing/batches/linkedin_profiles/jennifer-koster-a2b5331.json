As I gave this further thought throughout the day, I realized my achievements don't matter. It won't matter how many books I write, how many awards I receive, or how many successful exits I have. The only thing that matters is if I made a positive impact on people, on the world and, most importantly, my children. \n\nFor the last couple years, I have been deeply driven by a bigger purpose. A desire to help people. A desire to make the world a better place - more equal, more just, more open, more harmonious, more simple. Today, I hope that when my children celebrate their 47th birthdays that I leave them a planet to celebrate on that is in better shape than it is today.\n\nAs I track what is happening between natural disasters, mass shootings, environmental disasters, wars, and the climate crisis (which is now highly politicized as fossil fuels vs. sustainability, meat vs. plant-based, us vs. them), it only makes me more motivated to deliver real solutions to our real problems. \n\nI transitioned from high-end residential construction building luxury homes to launching a company that makes the whole construction process more efficient, less risky and more pleasant. Over the last year, I fully revived a plan I wrote 13 years ago for a sustainable community and my mission evolved to not just changing how we build, but changing how we LIVE.\n\nToday, I am on a mission to make existing buildings more efficient, healthy and sustainable, developing a global network of regenerative communities, and preparing to print my book. All to create a healthier balance between nature, home and people. To be more connected. To shift from achieving to being. To shift from fighting to loving - from struggling to thriving.\n\nThat is the legacy I hope to leave.\n170\n73 comments\nActivity\nActivity\n\n3,733 followers\n3,733 followers\n\nPosts\nComments\nImages\nDocuments\nLoaded 9 Posts posts\nJennifer Koster\nJennifer Koster\n \u2022 1st\n1st\nSerial Entrepreneur Re-Engineering How We Live, Work and Play\nSerial Entrepreneur Re-Engineering How We Live, Work and Play\n2d \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n \n2 days ago \u2022 Edited \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nExactly. We have the solutions. We just need to start using them and change legislation. We have water harvesting and filtration systems that can manage massive volumes of water, and when part of a well-designed lanscape plan can reduce potable water usage up to 100% by re-using rainwater and graywater.\n\nBUT - in most jurisdictions around the globe we can only use that water for irrigation and fire suppression. In some locations it can be re-used for toilets and sinks. Yet, the water coming out of our systems tests cleaner than the world's best drinking water. If we want to save our planet - it all starts with being smarter on how we use our most valuable resource. Without it there is no life. (and for those who don't believe we are in a planetary crisis - also no data centers)\n\nThis is not that complicated. We just have outdated systems and laws.\n\u2026more\nMoein Nodehi\nMoein Nodehi\n   \u2022 1st\nPremium \u2022 1st\nFounder Biotonomy.com | Co-Founder Circularliving.ai | Engineer & Architect | Advancing Nature Based, Self-Sufficient Buildings | Awarded by the United Nations, Government of Spain, M\u00e1laga City, Forbes\nFounder Biotonomy.com | Co-Founder Circularliving.ai | Engineer & Architect | Advancing Nature Based, Self-Sufficient Buildings | Awarded by the United Nations, Government of Spain, M\u00e1laga City, Forbes\nThis is one of the biggest design mistakes cities ever made.\n\nIn most cities, rainwater and sewage go through the same pipes.\n\nWhen it rains, clean water from roofs and streets mixes with dirty water from toilets and sinks.\n\nThe system can\u2019t handle it \u2014 so to stop flooding, it dumps everything straight into rivers and the sea.\n\nThis is called a Combined Sewer Overflow \u2014\nand it happens tens of thousands of times every year across Europe,\nwith over 650,000 overflow points still active today.\n\nThat means billions of liters of dirty water are released every time it rains heavily.\n\nSome newer cities tried to fix this by separating the pipes.\nBut instead of mixing, they now throw the rainwater away \u2014 sending it straight to the sea.\n\nOnce rainwater reaches the ocean, it becomes saltwater.\nIt can\u2019t be used again for drinking, farming, or nature \u2014\nit\u2019s lost from the freshwater cycle.\n\nThat\u2019s why cities flood in winter and dry up in summer \u2014\nbecause rain never reaches the ground to refill the soil and groundwater.\n\nBoth systems fail:\n\u25fe One pollutes water.\n\u25fe The other wastes it.\n\nThe solution is simple:\nLet rain soak into the ground.\nStore it. Reuse it. Don\u2019t throw it away.\n\nThat\u2019s how we restore the natural water cycle \u2014\nand fix one of the biggest urban design mistakes ever made.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Want to learn how to design buildings that restore water cycles?\nComment Academy, and I\u2019ll invite you to our waiting list.\n\nBIOTONOMY - Nature Based Architecture\n\n\nhashtag\n#Biotonomy \nhashtag\n#water \nhashtag\n#greencities\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n10\n1 repost\nJennifer Koster\nJennifer Koster\n \u2022 1st\n1st\nSerial Entrepreneur Re-Engineering How We Live, Work and Play\nSerial Entrepreneur Re-Engineering How We Live, Work and Play\n4d \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n \n4 days ago \u2022 Edited \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nWe are all charged up about Critical Infrastructure, and our growing list of projects indicates the market is too. \n\nWhy we love it? \n\nWe get to connect different solutions and minds to build smarter, more resilient systems for the future - finding ways to better use our limited resources while creating a positive impact. \n\nWe often talk about sustainability, but the real change happens when how we build, power, and sustain our communities work in harmony to reduce demand and eliminate (or use) waste. \n\nSo where is innovation making a real impact now? \n\n\u2192 Energy - Solar is just the beginning. \nBy integrating battery storage with renewable generation like wind and solar, we can turn building sites into mini power plants - generating, storing, and using energy locally. \n\n\u2192 Geothermal - In Northern Europe, geothermal fields have been used for decades, and now they are proving their impact around the world. With heating and cooling among the most energy-intensive needs we have, geothermal systems can cut that demand by up to 80%. \n\n\u2192 Water - Our planet\u2019s most valuable resource. \nWe bring innovative Dutch startups into projects of all sizes to harvest, process, store and reuse rainwater and recycle greywater. In drought-stricken regions like California, capturing and reusing rainwater instead of releasing it into the ocean will transform irrigation and fire prevention, saving millions of gallons of valuable potable drinking water.\n\nCritical infrastructure is evolving quickly - and it\u2019s exciting to see what\u2019s possible when innovation meets intention. \n\nWhich of these technologies do you think will have the biggest impact in the next decade? \n\n\nhashtag\n#infrastructure \nhashtag\n#sustainability \nhashtag\n#renewableenergy \nhashtag\n#geothermal \nhashtag\n#watermanagement \nhashtag\n#innovation \nhashtag\n#climateaction \nhashtag\n#resilience \nhashtag\n#werkwell\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n8\n2 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nCo-Founder and CEO\nCo-Founder and CEO\nWerkWell Project Services\nWerkWell Project Services\nJul 2017 - Present \u00b7 8 yrs 4 mos\nJul 2017 to Present \u00b7 8 yrs 4 mos\nThe Hague, South Holland, Netherlands\nThe Hague, South Holland, Netherlands\nWerkWell provides construction management and sustainability solutions to clients ranging from high-end residential, multi-family, commercial, hospitality, and healthcare for retrofit and new construction projects.
