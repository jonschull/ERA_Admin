I moved to Colombia to live out my dream of helping to regenerate the earth alongside my life partner, Joe Brewer. Together, we are doing ecosystem restoration work and helping to create a local regenerative economy in our bioregion in and around Barichara. We also co-founded the Design School for Regenerating Earth where we are helping to activate bioregional organizing and facilitating learning journeys and learning exchanges between bioregions across the planet. \n\nI'm passionate about integrating and applying unified science, integral philosophy, regenerative practices, and biodynamic healing and trauma resolution to everything I do.

Heiple\n   \u2022 1st\nVerified \u2022 1st\nCo-Founder Design School for Regenerating Earth\nCo-Founder Design School for Regenerating Earth\n2d \u2022 \n \n2 days ago \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nThe energy that's fueled ecological and cultural overshoot has come from pulling ancient carbon out of the Earth exponentially faster than it was sequestered over millions of years by the daily flows of the sun, soil, and plants.\n\nCarbon energy has also fueled the accumulation and power of fungible currency. Current financial capital is untethered from the biophysical constraints of Earth's capacity.\n\nSays regenerative economist John Fullerton, \"I know that the current economy is driven by finance and if the economic premise of our entire global economy is in conflict with the laws of physics, we have a serious problem.\"\n\nIt\u2019s time for the Great (Re)Turning.\n\u2026more\nBrian Puppa\nBrian Puppa\n \u2022 1st\n1st\nExecutive Director \u2013 Legacy Project\nExecutive Director \u2013 Legacy Project\nSo much is happening now that it can be very disorienting. People are trying to find their bearings, trying to find a story that makes some sense and can orient them. \n \nThe co-stewards of Bioregional Earth \u2013 myself and Legacy Project Founder Susan Bosak, along with Joe Brewer and Penny L. Heiple of the Design School for Regenerating Earth \u2013 have been thinking a lot about this, and have written an article together.\n\nWe won't find what we need in the noise. \n \nThere are so many \"theories of change\" and \"transformational ideas\" out there. Somehow we've come to believe that new is better, and abstraction is a higher form of thinking. But then we can't seem to figure out how to implement all the ideas people are generating. It's because we're starting in the wrong place.\n \nWe actually need to start with what's old, and has stood the test of time. And we need to start with what's real, on the ground, right under our feet.\n \nThat's why \"bioregional\" and \"regenerative\" work can't just be the trend of the moment, but has to be understood as living into the story of Bioregional Earth in the context of The Great (Re)Turning.\n \nWe draw on many voices in our latest collaborative article. To quote just one, John Fullerton, this is an \"unfolding, filled with mystery and even magic. It cannot be achieved, only facilitated and participated in.\"\n \nCheck out the whole article about The Great (Re)Turning:\nhttps://lnkd.in/g4puCp-E\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n2\nPenny L.

This article recounts their extraordinary journeys. It is a delight. \n\nNext Thursday, 23rd October, 4pm GMT, in the Design School for Regenerating Earth, Elyes Mkacher and myself with the Western European Atlantic Coastal BioRegion will be holding a 1-hour celebration of the \nhashtag\n#BirdNations as BioRegional Ambassadors.\n\nThe \nhashtag\n#BirdNations connect our \nhashtag\n#BioRegions, and whilst we can often spend time \"defining\" those regions, it is important to remember that a BioRegion is never isolated \u2013 there may be a watershed or a specific ecozone, but, for example, the Western European Atlantic Coastal BioRegion is deeply connected to the region of the \nhashtag\n#GulfOfMexico, the warm saline waters that will then speed across the Atlantic and warm our region... Many of our \nhashtag\n#BirdNations \u2013 as this article beautifully illustrates \u2013 migrate from one BioRegion to another, as they overwinter in one region, and oversummer elsewhere. Watching animations of bird migrations enables us to visualise the to-and-fro movements that contribute to our planetary home. \n\nPlease join us in the Design School for Regenerating Earth next Thursday, for this Inter-BioRegional Event. If you would like to join us please use this link. Membership of the school is $5 a month \u2013 a truly great $5 for all the amazingness that the School brings together. Your subscription also helps to fund regenerative projects in the School. \n\nDesign School for Regenerating Earth: https://lnkd.in/eWjtzB84\n\nGuardian article: https://lnkd.in/dwJB2wZC\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n17\n2 comments\n4 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nCo-Founder\nCo-Founder\nDesign School for Regenerating Earth \u00b7 Self-employed\nDesign School for Regenerating Earth \u00b7 Self-employed\nMar 2023 - Present \u00b7 2 yrs 8 mos\nMar 2023 to Present \u00b7 2 yrs 8 mos\nIn the Design School for Regenerating Earth, we host online courses on organizational development, landscape restoration, and cooperation.
