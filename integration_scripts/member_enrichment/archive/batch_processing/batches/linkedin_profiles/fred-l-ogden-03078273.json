For air (assuming \u03b3 = 1.4), the stagnation temperature ratio at Mach 6.5 is:\nTt/T=1+\u03b3\u221212M2=1+0.2(6.5)2\u22489.45\n\nThe stagnation pressure ratio is:\npt/p=(1+\u03b3\u221212M2)\u03b3\u03b3\u22121\u2248(9.45)3.5\u22482,963.7\n\nUsing the equation of state and assuming perfect gas behavior, the density ratio is: \n\u03c1t/\u03c1=(pt/p)/(Tt/T)\u22482,963.7/9.45\u2248313.6\n\nI don't think that this is true. The shock wave from this flight would be magnificently large, loud and wasteful. The pressure at the stagnation points would be 3000 * atmospheric pressure!! The temperature at the stagnation points would be at least 2500C- glowing white hot!\n\u2026more\nashor elmargane\nashor elmargane\n \u2022 3rd+\n3rd+\nchief-editor at Libyan airforce media center\nchief-editor at Libyan airforce media center\nChina's hypersonic transporter prototype flies at Mach 6.5\nScientists in China have announced that a jumbo jet prototype built by them had managed to reach hypersonic speeds (Mach 5 and above) during a flight test\nChinese scientists claim their bulky aircraft prototype reached Mach 6.56 (5,033 mph) during a test flight in August 2021 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The results, initially kept secret due to project sensitivity, were recently revealed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in a social media post featuring a speech by project leader Cui Kai.\nThe 20-minute test flight reportedly validated the feasibility of the design, overcoming skepticism about its unconventional, bulky form. Historically, hypersonic technologies have been limited to missiles and unmanned military vehicles due to restricted internal space. Cui's work marks a significant step toward future hypersonic passenger and cargo aircraft, pushing aviation technology beyond supersonic models like the Concorde.\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n3\n1 comment\nFred L.

In that role I helped to co-teach ENR capstone courses involving environmental impact assessments. I also participated in joint research projects. Most of my energy was expended within the college of engineering, where I taught an average of about 2.5 courses per year, advised 4-6 graduate students, one to three post-docs, and up to two professional research staff. During my tenure at the University of Wyoming, I attracted over $7M in external research funding, including over $5.6M as principal investigator. These funds were used to support students, staff, and acquire significant amounts of research infrastructure. I led writing of an NSF grant proposal that received $1.0M of funding towards the purchase of UW\u2019s first large supercomputer cluster, Mt. Moran. My most significant accomplishment was my leadership of the U. Wyoming team that discovered the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation, a groundbreaking finding that solved a long-standing challenge in hydrologic prediction. His team-oriented research on high-performance computing in hydrology attracted funding from the U.S. National Weather Service, Office of Water Prediction, aimed at improved local flood predictions at the continental scale. Addressing a problem of global hydro-economic importance, I led an international team of researchers funded by the NSF Water, Sustainability, and Climate program from 2012-2018 researching the effectiveness of payment for ecosystem services schemes to increase water resources reliability in the Panama Canal Watershed. That project led to a seminal publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.\nThe Cline Distinguished Chair of Engineering, Environment, and Natural Resources, was created by an endowment from Roy and Caryl Cline, to foster increased interactions between the College of Engineering and the Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources (ENR).

As a member of the Environmental Engineering Program, I worked closely with a very dynamic group of faculty. Starting from scratch as an Assistant Professor with no external funds and no graduate students, I built an international research program with an excellent cadre of graduate students. Together we attacked and solved some very interesting problems related to distributed parameter computational hydrological modeling. We also established a 17 ha hydrologic observatory at Cerro Pelado, near Gamboa, in the Republic of Panama. Together with other faculty collaborators at UConn I helped to perform a detailed study on the effect of a municipal groundwater well field on a small river, which would occasionally go dry in the fall when the pumps were switched on. I enjoyed my time teaching at UConn and made good friends there. Above all, I cherished all the student interactions as a mentor and collaborator.\nI rose though the ranks from Assistant to Associate Professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering, earning tenure in 2000.
