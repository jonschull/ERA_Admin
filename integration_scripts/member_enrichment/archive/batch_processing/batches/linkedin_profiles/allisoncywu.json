Yesterday however we learned that we have become one of the startups that will dissolve in this wave of economy depression.\n\nTogether, in almost 2 years, we built state-of-the-art cloud infrastructures, bioinformatics algorithms, analysis pipelines that supported automated analysis of 5000+ samples within 8 months. Aside from this, we stood up the data infrastructures that enabled data visibility for the rest of the organization to pivot and respond to changes in the market. I am very proud with what we have achieved within this short amount of time.\n\nIf you're seeing this post and you're in need of any of the following talents for the specific positions. Please DM me as I have recommendations of great talents that just got back to the market now. I would work with these talents in a beat if I have a chance:\n- Bioinformatics scientist: NGS analysis, algorithm development, statistics, machine learning\n- Data scientist: specializing in production level machine learning modeling, deployment (MLOps), statistics, data visualization, data wrangling, data analytics\n- Bioinformatics/Data Engineer: AWS cloud infrastructure, bioinformatics/ML pipeline engineering (MLOps), DevOps, Serverless ETL\n\nObviously, now I'm back into the market as well and would love to catch some coffee with anyone. ;)\n\n\nhashtag\n#opentowork \nhashtag\n#opentoopportunities \nhashtag\n#startup \nhashtag\n#startuplife \n82\n11 comments\nPost\nPost\nFirst time getting featured by our great team!\n128\n3 comments\nPost\nPost\nUS biotech company launches \u2018novel\u2019 prenatal screening test\nfemtechworld.co.uk\n61\nLink\nLink\nSpark Summit 2020 Talk: Enabling Scalable Data Science Pipeline with Mlflow at Thermo Fisher Scientific\nSpark Summit 2020 Talk: Enabling Scalable Data Science Pipeline with Mlflow at Thermo Fisher Scientific\nDatabricks\nDatabricks\nThermo Fisher Scientific has one of the most extensive product portfolios in the industry, ranging from reagents to capital instruments across customers in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, academic, and more.

This talk is a summary of our journey from past to current state, as well as looking ahead to the future of our platform.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nUtilizing big data for machine learning requires not just machine learning knowledge but also technical infrastructure to support continuous development, deployment and delivery for machine learning models.\nHow you can build a scalable data science pipeline with latest Databricks technologies.\nThermo Fisher Scientific has one of the most extensive product portfolios in the industry, ranging from reagents to capital instruments across customers in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, academic, and more.
