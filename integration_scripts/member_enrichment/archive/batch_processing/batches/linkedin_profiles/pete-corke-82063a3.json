They are looking for opportunities to leverage their skills, expertise, and networks. And they are leaning into collaboration \u2013 because it\u2019s together, across disciplines and geographies, and by leveraging our diversity of lived experiences, that we can test ideas and move to action.\u201d \n\n\ud83d\udd17 Read more about these partners in our announcement: https://lnkd.in/eV_rcSTs\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Swipe to hear from partners on why they are joining the Hub, including Kate Potter, Paula Glick, Pete Corke, David Roy, James Snider, and Jodi Hilty\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\n1/8\nActivate to view larger image,\n32\n1 comment\n3 reposts\nPete Corke\nPete Corke\n \u2022 1st\n1st\nRegenerative Innovator \ud83c\udf32\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf0e\nRegenerative Innovator \ud83c\udf32\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf0e\n1mo \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n \n1 month ago \u2022 Edited \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nWe are grateful to have been supported in our mission at Kwaxala by Realize Capital Partners, who have truly embraced our vision for what investment in natural capital can and should look like. Our pilot on Kwiakah First Nation territory shows a hopeful way forward that enables highly equitable investment into natural capital in deep long-term partnership with Nature's most proven stewards. This work is about much more than reconciling humanity's relationship with the forest, it is also about meaningfully supporting Indigenous self-governance and economic sovereignty. This is about systemic transformation on multiple levels.\n\nIf you're considering investment in this space and the solution offered is not majority owned and controlled by First Nations or Indigenous partners you should question why and whether they are even truly legitimate as a result. This space should be about solutions defined by our ecosystem's most proven 'asset managers' who have lived and breathed amongst them for generations, not those sat in skyscrapers. Kwaxala projects don't just flow the significant majority of annual income to our First Nation partners, the significant majority of asset value created also remains held by the Nations, creating true economic sovereignty far beyond that of just annual Carbon Revenue sharing. Kwaxala itself is also structured to always be majority owned by the network of Indigenous Forest partners we are now actively growing.\n\nThis is just Kwaxala's first step. Our foundations have been built to support Nations in benefiting from the new regenerative asset class that Living Forest Shares represent. Not just in Canada but globally. Living Forest Shares give Nations access to fair rate capital to establish and fund Nature regeneration projects on territory and Kwaxala's unique network structure ensures that scale and collective benefit does not come at the cost of the territorial sovereignty of our Forest Partners. For Living Forest Share investors it is an opportunity to have visible direct local impact alongside consolidated project structure and returns as well as a global vision for systemic transformation. \n\nOn a personal level, I am honoured to have been able to work so closely with, and in service to, the Kwiakah First Nation to shape this vision (and make it legislatively possible!) alongside an amazing, dedicated and focused founding team. I look forward to the work ahead.
