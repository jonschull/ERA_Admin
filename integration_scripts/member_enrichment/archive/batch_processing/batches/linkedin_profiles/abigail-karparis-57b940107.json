I have also had the opportunity to use farming as a means of travel, that has taken me across the United States, into the Pacific and New Zealand, and down to Costa Rica, further diversifying not only my agricultural experience, but also the people, ecosystems, and soil types, that I am working with and learning from.\n\nI have both a foundation rooted in science, data collection, and academic research and applied skills and experience working in the field and within communities. \n\nCommunity immersion has led me to value community-based solutions and local knowledge, especially that of indigenous populations, and I see this, as well as the associated sovereignty, as central to creating industry change and an agricultural system that allows both humans and nature to thrive in regenerative and abundant systems\n\nI believe in a locally intensive action, supported by a global network. I am always looking to connect with individuals, organizations, and communities around the world in our collaborative efforts towards global transformation.\nI see food as our most intimate connection with nature, and it is my mission to use this to reconnect people with the earth.
