Due to increased exploitation of this natural resource, the palm species is declining in the region of Kwamalasamutu, southern Suriname. Sustainable harvesting methods for this understorey palm will not only benefit the palm populations but also the people of Kwamalasamutu and the surrounding natural forest. For data collection I spent 3 months in Kwamalasamutu. This research project was part of the Twinning project between the Amazon Conservation Team and Utrecht University.\nResearch project on sustainable harvesting of the understorey palm Geonoma baculifera, that indigenous people use for roof thatching.
