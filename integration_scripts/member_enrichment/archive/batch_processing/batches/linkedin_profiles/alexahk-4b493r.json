These species have intense histories surrounding conservation, and allowed me to construct narratives centered on the relationship between public policy and healthy, biodiverse ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, I was given the opportunity to present my knowledge of AI\u2019s environmental impact with the wonderful scientists, activists, and professionals of the Eco Restoration Alliance. This experience allowed me to polish my presentation and communication skills, and I\u2019d like to thank Jon Schull for facilitating my involvement!\n\nThere are many projects that I couldn\u2019t fit in this post, so it\u2019s safe to say that this was an incredible and comprehensive experience- I received no shortage of valuable perspectives and vital skills I\u2019ll be able to carry through the next stages of my professional and academic journey. I would especially like to thank Louise Mitchell for her attentive mentorship and for making this role possible!\n\u2026more\n30\n3 comments\nAlexa Hankins reposted this\nBiodiversity for a Livable Climate\nBiodiversity for a Livable Climate\n2,487 followers\n2,487 followers\n4mo \u2022 \n \n4 months ago \u2022 Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn\nMuch of the U.S. is sweating through record-breaking temperatures this week. We'll hear a lot about cooling centers and public fans, but\u00a0it\u2019s time to talk about the planet\u2019s most undervalued cooling system: water. \n\nForests, soils, and oceans manage heat naturally, if we let them.\n\nLed by Hart Hagan and featuring guest instructors Brock Dolman (OCCIDENTAL ARTS & ECOLOGY CENTER), Anastassia Makarieva, Dr. Katie Ross, Walter Jehne (Regenerate Earth), and Didi Pershouse, this new course from Bio4Climate reveals what the climate conversation is missing and how water, not just carbon, holds the key to cooling a warming planet.\n\nRegister by July 10!\nhttps://lnkd.in/dKvpQN25\n\u2026more\nActivate to view larger image,\nActivate to view larger image,\n83\n6 comments\n11 reposts\nShow all posts\nExperience\nExperience\nFall Correspondent- Berlin \nFall Correspondent- Berlin \nIES Abroad\nIES Abroad\nAug 2025 - Present \u00b7 3 mos\nAug 2025 to Present \u00b7 3 mos\nCreating published blog entries to promote IES Abroad programing, and to inform prospective study abroad students\nCreating published blog entries to promote IES Abroad programing, and to inform prospective study abroad students\nEcological Communications Intern\nEcological Communications Intern\nBiodiversity for a Livable Climate \u00b7 Internship\nBiodiversity for a Livable Climate \u00b7 Internship\nMay 2025 - Present \u00b7 6 mos\nMay 2025 to Present \u00b7 6 mos\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States \u00b7 Remote\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States \u00b7 Remote\nMuseum Tour Guide\nMuseum Tour Guide\nGibson House Museum\nGibson House Museum\nJul 2025 - Aug 2025 \u00b7 2 mos\nJul 2025 to Aug 2025 \u00b7 2 mos\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States\nBoston, Massachusetts, United States\nGave 45-minute group tours of The Gibson House, a Victorian-era home in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood.\nUndertook substantial historical research to enrich my knowledge of the period and provide personalized experiences to guests.\nGave 45-minute group tours of The Gibson House, a Victorian-era home in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood.
