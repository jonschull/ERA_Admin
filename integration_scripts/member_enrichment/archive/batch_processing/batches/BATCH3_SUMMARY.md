## Process Improvements (v2)

### What's New Since Batch 1-2:

**1. Phone Number Integration (SOURCE 5)**
- Added Google Contacts export as 5th data source
- Script now checks `google_contacts.csv` automatically
- Phone numbers with labels (Mobile, Work, Home, etc.)
- Found: Ben Rubin (2 phones), Jacob Denlinger (1 phone)

**2. Batch Mode**
- New `--batch N` flag creates single combined file
- All members in `batch3.md` (not individual files)
- Easier review: scroll through all members in one document
- Individual JSONs still saved for programmatic access

**3. Improved Workflow**
```bash
# Old way (Batch 1-2):
python3 aggregate_member_info.py "Member 1"
python3 aggregate_member_info.py "Member 2"
# Creates: member_1.md, member_2.md

# New way (Batch 3+):
python3 aggregate_member_info.py "Member 1" "Member 2" "Member 3" "Member 4" --batch 3
# Creates: batch3.md (all 4 members combined)
```

**4. Data Completeness**
- 5 sources now checked (was 4)
- Sources summary shows ✅/❌ for all 5
- Phone numbers visible in reports
