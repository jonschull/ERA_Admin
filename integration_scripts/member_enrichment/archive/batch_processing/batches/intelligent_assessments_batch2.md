- ✅ Airtable: Confirmed (email matches)
- ✅ LinkedIn: 100% exact match
- ✅ Transcripts: **EXCELLENT** - 103 mentions (most in batch!)

  - Database has CURRENT position (teaching, as of 2024-2025)
- Email `bwrubin@gmail.com` (personal, not institutional)
- **CONFIDENCE: HIGH** - Same person, LinkedIn needs updating

### Information Synthesis from Transcripts & Summary

**Who is Ben Rubin?** (from his own words, lines 161350-161359)

> "I'm here in Rochester, New York, working in the public school system teaching visual arts the last three years, sort of jumping into the hot seat. There was a big shortage after the pandemic, so it was kind of a career change opportunity. Before that worked with John Scholl with the Enable Project, so the three Princeton prosthetics spent a number of years in Southeast Asia working on different projects related to education."

**Current project** (from transcript):
> "What I'm going to share is a plan for taking one of the unused outdoor spaces at the school where I teach and turning it into an outdoor classroom, basically a nature peace classroom. There was a small grant that I got over the summer to do some training and get certified with some different strategies on that."

**From Fathom Summary - Action Items:**
- Plan visit to Seneca Meadows Preserve with Ben Rubin when weather improves
- Research digital microscopes (~$50) for classroom use, explore culinary herb growing project with immigrant students

**Jon's description** (line 163253):
> "Ben Rubin from Rochester in New York about taking nature, taking kids to nature and nature to kids in schools."

**Background:**
- Long-time collaborator with Jon Schull (E-nable Project)
- Worked on 3D prosthetics
- Spent years in Southeast Asia on education projects
- Career change after pandemic → visual arts teacher (3 years)
- Now: Creating outdoor nature classroom at Rochester International Academy
- Working with immigrant students on culinary herb growing
- Got grant for nature classroom certification

### Proposed Bio

"Ben Rubin is a visual arts teacher at Rochester International Academy in New York, where he is transforming an unused outdoor space into a nature peace classroom for immigrant students. A long-time collaborator on the E-nable Project's 3D prosthetics work and former educator in Southeast Asia, Ben joined ERA in 2024 to explore connections between ecological restoration and hands-on learning in urban schools."

### Proposed Airtable Updates
- **Bio:** [as above]
- **Email:** bwrubin@gmail.com ✅ (already correct)
- **Phone:** [none found]
- **Affiliated Orgs:** Rochester International Academy, E-nable Project (former)
- **Note:** LinkedIn shows outdated position (Media Coordinator at E-nable)

### Questions for Human Review
1. Should we mention the Southeast Asia education work or keep focus on current work?
2. "Immigrant students" - is this too specific/sensitive, or important context?
3. Should we ask Ben to update his LinkedIn to reflect current teaching position?

## ASSESSMENT 2: Alfredo Quarto

### Data Sources
- ✅ Database: Minimal (attended 1 TH, May 2025)
- ✅ Airtable: Has org record link
- ❌ LinkedIn: No matches found
- ❌ Transcripts: No mentions found
- ✅ Fathom Summary: Available (9,705 chars) but may not mention him specifically

### Challenge: Very Limited Data

**What we know:**
- Attended May 14, 2025 Town Hall (recent!)
- Airtable has affiliated org: `recfCNv928LBzw3fO`
- No email in database
- Not in your LinkedIn connections
- No transcript mentions (didn't speak in TH?)

**Fathom Summary shows:** Meeting was about membership growth, committees, Panama trip, Africa microgrants - but no specific mention of Alfredo in the summary

### Investigation Needed

**Need to:**
1. Look up Airtable org record `recfCNv928LBzw3fO` - what organization is this?
2. Search your email for "Alfredo Quarto" - might have correspondence
3. Google search "Alfredo Quarto" + environmental/restoration terms
4. Check Town Hall participant list/agenda for May 14 meeting

**Hypothesis:** Alfredo may have:
- Attended but didn't speak (participant only)
- Different spelling (Alfred? Alfredo Quartos?)
- Using different name in LinkedIn
- Not yet connected on LinkedIn

### Proposed Action

**DEFER THIS MEMBER** until we can:
- Identify the affiliated organization from Airtable record
- Search email correspondence
- Get more context

**OR ASK USER:**
"Do you know Alfredo Quarto? What organization is he with?"

### Why Defer?

Creating a bio with essentially no information would be:
- Generic and unhelpful
- Potentially inaccurate
- Not following our "context-rich" principle

Better to flag for additional research or user input.

## ASSESSMENT 3: Noura Angulo

### Data Sources
- ✅ Database: Strong (location, affiliation, email, 1 Town Hall)
- ✅ Airtable: Confirmed (email matches)
- ✅ LinkedIn: 100% exact match
- ✅ Transcripts: Good - 4 mentions with introduction context
- ✅ Fathom Summary: Available (8,434 chars)

### LinkedIn Match Verification
**Match:** Noura Angulo (100% EXACT) ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence for verification:**
- Database affiliation: "Political science major, economics minor, interning with Biodiversity for a Livable Climate"
- LinkedIn position: "Empirical Reasoning Fellow at Barnard College"
- Email: `nea2132@barnard.edu` ← **Barnard student email confirms**
- **Assessment:** PERFECT ALIGNMENT
  - Database shows internship (Biodiversity for a Livable Climate)
  - LinkedIn shows academic fellowship (Barnard College)
  - Both are correct - she's a student doing an internship
  - Connected on LinkedIn same day as Town Hall (May 8, 2024)
- **CONFIDENCE: ABSOLUTE** - No doubt, all sources align

### Information Synthesis from Transcripts & Summary

**From Fathom Summary - Key Takeaways:**
> "Several new members introduced themselves and their projects, including John Goedschalk (Biotara), Noura Angulo (Biodiversity for a Livable Climate intern), and Hollis McLellan..."

**From Transcript** (line 85152):
Listed as present: "Noura Angulo" among participants
Listed in agenda: "[Rayan Farhoumand](link), ERA Intern" - showing intern context

**Context from meeting:**
- May 8, 2024 Town Hall
- Action item mentions scheduling check-ins with "intern Ryan Farhoman" (different intern)
- Meeting discussed ERA member directory development ($3,000 proposal)
- Several new members introduced themselves

**What we know:**
- Barnard College student (political science major, economics minor)
- Based in Washington D.C.
- Interning with Biodiversity for a Livable Climate (Philip Bogdonoff's organization)
- Joined ERA in May 2024
- Empirical Reasoning Fellow (academic honor/program at Barnard)

### Proposed Bio

"Noura Angulo is a political science and economics student at Barnard College and an Empirical Reasoning Fellow. Based in Washington, D.C., she interned with Biodiversity for a Livable Climate and joined ERA in 2024 to explore the intersection of policy, economics, and ecological restoration."

### Proposed Airtable Updates
- **Bio:** [as above]
- **Email:** nea2132@barnard.edu ✅ (already correct)
- **Phone:** [none found]
- **Affiliated Orgs:** Barnard College, Biodiversity for a Livable Climate
- **Publish:** Already True - ready when bio added

### Questions for Human Review
1. Is "student" appropriate, or prefer "Empirical Reasoning Fellow" emphasis?
2. Should we mention internship in past tense (since May 2024) or present?
3. Is she still active in ERA, or was this a one-time attendance?

## BATCH SUMMARY

**Success rate:** 2/3 fully assessable, 1/3 needs more research

**What worked well:**
1. **Fathom summaries are GOLD** - Action items show specific context
2. **Rich transcript mentions** (Ben: 103!) provide detailed self-descriptions
3. **Email domains confirm institutions** (Barnard student email)
4. **LinkedIn timing** (connected same day as TH) confirms meeting context

**New challenge discovered:**
1. **Members who attend but don't speak** (Alfredo) - hard to assess
2. **Airtable org record IDs** - need to decode these
3. **LinkedIn can be outdated** - database affiliation more current

**Key insight:**
When someone has 100+ transcript mentions vs 0 mentions, the difference is participation level:
- Ben gave a presentation → rich data
- Alfredo attended passively → minimal data

**Recommendation:**
Prioritize members who actively participated in calls (spoke, presented) over passive attendees.

## SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION: Alfredo Quarto

**Before proceeding with Alfredo's bio, please:**
1. Check what organization is `recfCNv928LBzw3fO` in Airtable
2. Search your email for "Alfredo Quarto"
3. Or let me know if you recognize the name

**Otherwise:** Add to "needs manual research" list for later batch.

**Ready for human review.**
