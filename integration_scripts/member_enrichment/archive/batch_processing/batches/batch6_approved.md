## Charles Eisenstein

Charles Eisenstein is an author, speaker, and cultural philosopher whose books—including Sacred Economics (2011), The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is Possible (2013), and Climate: A New Story (2018)—explore themes of ecological interconnection, gift economics, and the transition from separation to interbeing. A Yale graduate in Mathematics and Philosophy, Eisenstein challenges conventional narratives around money, growth, and climate change, proposing that our environmental crisis stems from viewing nature as separate from ourselves rather than sacred and inherently valuable. His work advocates for economic degrowth, gift economy principles, and reframing our relationship with the living world beyond carbon metrics and instrumental value.
