**[00:20:05] Ben Rubin**
> Say hello now, if he would.

**[00:20:08] Ben Rubin**
> Sure.

**[00:20:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm here in Rochester, New York, working in the public school system teaching visual arts the last three years, sort of jumping into the hot seat.

**[00:20:22] Ben Rubin**
> There was a big shortage after the pandemic, so it was kind of a career change opportunity, before that worked with John Scholl with the Enable Project, so the three Princeton prosthetics spent a number of years in Southeast Asia working on different projects related to education, I guess in terms of tonight, what I'm going to share is a plan for taking one of the unused outdoor spaces at the school where I teach.

**[00:21:00] Ben Rubin**
> and turning it into an outdoor classroom, basically a nature peace classroom.

**[00:21:06] Ben Rubin**
> There was a small grant that I got over the summer to do some training and get certified with some different strategies on that.

**[00:21:15] Ben Rubin**
> I figured I'd just share it's a small project, but I can share that and get some ideas from all of you.

**[00:21:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:21:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:21:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The incomparable Indie Singh is here.

**[00:21:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you turn on your video and say hello?

**[00:21:29] indy singh**
> Of course.

**[00:21:30] indy singh**
> Hey guys.

**[00:21:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's up?

**[00:21:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How are you doing?

**[00:21:37] indy singh**
> Faze right now.

**[00:21:38] indy singh**
> How do I do this?

**[00:21:40] indy singh**
> Should I land first or should I keep the spaceship?

**[00:21:44] indy singh**
> What's up everybody?

**[00:21:46] indy singh**
> I hope you all are doing well.

**[00:21:48] indy singh**
> Thank you all for all the restoration work.

**[00:21:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indie, think you're going behind the moon right now.

**[00:21:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> You're breaking up.

**[00:22:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Alright, let's see.

**[00:22:01] indy singh**
> Let's see, let's see, let's see.

**[00:22:02] indy singh**
> Let's see if you guys can hear me now.

**[00:22:04] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, we got a flavor for Indy.

**[00:22:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indy, I've noticed you've been really active.

**[00:22:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> seems like you really got something great going on.

**[00:22:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'd like an update, but your connectivity is not good at this moment.

**[00:22:16] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> looks like everything was really high right now on my end.

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure?

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> bit more.

**[00:22:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can mention, Katie and Ben, that our ritual here at the ERA, which may change soon, is that ERA members become ERA members when they introduce themselves at a town hall meeting, which you have now done.

**[00:22:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a week later, assuming there are no objections, you've become full-fledged members with all the rights and responsibilities, too, which really basically just include checking in every so often, subscribing to our social media, findable through our website, and then

**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Passing on social media that resonate with you when you think would resonate with your network To other people in your network.

**[00:23:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It is also possible to Donate to the ERA.

**[00:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's a link on our website, and I am laboring mightily to try to get a Majority of our members to become recurring donors at whatever level they would like even a dollar a month because that It's a good thing and it actually tells us a little something about what we can count on All I'm going through routine issues here, I will mention that we do have our annual general meeting next month on May 14th, I believe and in preparation for that We're all Trying to assess what has happened since a year ago, and I am now putting into the chat a form Where Natalie

**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> mentioned that he just published a book, and Steve can mention that he just published a book, and Rob can mention that he just published another article, and we will try to bring all of that together in time from May 14th.

**[00:24:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, well, you will of course give our speakers your undivided attention.

**[00:24:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> I urge you to click the link.

**[00:24:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This form is basically untested, and see if you can put some information in it, and then I'll know if it works because I'm going be sending it to everybody in the ERA, all four to five hundred of us.

**[00:24:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:24:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First guest and speaker and soon-to-be ERA member is Steve Apfelbaum, a book of whose I have in my living room, and I started quite some time ago when I heard about him through Bio4Climate, and apparently the author of many books with more to come.

**[00:24:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Steve, give us your story, please.

**[00:24:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well, where do I start?

**[00:25:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, as a young child, nature was my passion, my bliss, uh, rehabilitating injured and raising baby animals was, uh, I did and was on a veterinary medicine tract to work with wild animals and, uh, and in vet school and a professor said, Hey, you love canoeing in wilderness.

**[00:25:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's a grant to do some research in a wilderness area.

**[00:25:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I said, Oh, wow, you mean like not having to take care of dogs and city cats?

**[00:25:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it turned out we got the grant and spent basically fast forward 40 years of staying the fire ecology of the boundary water, wilderness, and Quedicope Provincial Park couldn't be

**[00:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Northeastern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario and basically went on to graduate school as a result of that opportunity.

**[00:26:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> And my whole life has been focused on studying the healthiest ecosystems on the planet, measuring biodiversity, a whole range of functions, publishing technical articles, learning what we can from those systems and then emulating that and bringing that into design in urban systems and rural systems.

**[00:26:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So learning from caribou and bison and working with grazing systems, the soil carbon cowboy series that you may or may not have heard about, that's our work with Alan Williams and Gabe Brown.

**[00:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a whole bunch of people.

**[00:27:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now we've worked on about 100 million acres bringing improved grazing and provided the science and are continuing to expand on the climate mitigation opportunities and the biodiversity mitigation opportunities.

**[00:27:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That introduced me to the need for translating the science into market language.

**[00:27:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We put together in 2009 with Ratan Lal and a number of the top soil scientists on the planet, a carbon measurement protocol that became a global standard.

**[00:27:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Vera published it as VM0021.

**[00:27:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've subsequently converted that into a family of standards called the Regenerative Standard.

**[00:27:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> And last year alone, we have with project developers

**[00:28:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for about a million acres of improved grazing in North America and were on a track to hit 20 to 30 million acres in five or six years.

**[00:28:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> One of the things that we learned during the process of trying to work at landscape scales and get the science right and get the policy right and get the market right and get the trust and transparency right, was that there was no way to ecological literacy across any of those subjects.

**[00:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we spun out a company.

**[00:28:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> I retired from my company, Applied Ecological Services, about in 2021 and spun up a non-profit called Applied Ecological Institute.

**[00:28:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm Wisconsin based, Katie.

**[00:28:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're in southern Wisconsin.

**[00:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these heads.

**[00:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that organization has started a new company called Stratifix, which is a subscriber SaaS-based business that is basically bringing 200 or more datasets and mapping capabilities to any piece of land in the U.S.

**[00:29:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> currently and North America, less detailed.

**[00:29:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> But you can look at any piece of property.

**[00:29:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll immediately have the land ownership and all sorts of other amazing data, assessed value, value of improvements.

**[00:29:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then there's nearly 200 natural resource datasets that you can apply to that property.

**[00:29:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can do scenario planning for evaluating different land uses, whether it be restoration,

**[00:30:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for agricultural practices, adapt to multi-pedic grazing versus continuous conventional no-till versus whatever pillage.

**[00:30:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can evaluate different crops.

**[00:30:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you could do highest and best value optimization using actual real-time spot pricing for the commodities and all the NASS USDA data sets with the average soil yields and the economics for every county in the US.

**[00:30:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So that's spun up and that's really helping us do restoration at scale, including we used it to do about a billion and a half acre prioritization of all the grassland restoration opportunities in North America.

**[00:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's now being used by the voluntary carbon market by a number of players to go out and secure.

**[00:31:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or the landowner partnering relationships to do the improved grazing.

**[00:31:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a lot of that stuff that I've been working on.

**[00:31:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Education is kind of what brought me to contact you, John.

**[00:31:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> I've been teaching for about 12 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, co-teaching a class on the future of coastal ecosystems on the planet.

**[00:31:26] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then with COVID, I kind of retired from that job because it was no fun teaching over Zoom.

**[00:31:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, the personal relationships and the field work with the students is what really kind of made everything work well.

**[00:31:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> But there's an incredible unmet demand for bringing ecosystem restoration to not just the landowners that may have no technical training and what they want is, you know, how to

**[00:32:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do I do this?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do first?

**[00:32:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> What's it going to cost?

**[00:32:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> What are the downsides?

**[00:32:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, what are my decisions and how significant are they or can I grow into it lightly and kind of learn along the route?

**[00:32:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what I've proposed to the ecological society is a series of two-hour primers which I've already been teaching.

**[00:32:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> I did two of them in the past month with them and then a six or a 12-hour online class and then one week classes in the field in various places around the starting here in Wisconsin, southern Wisconsin.

**[00:32:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> we're doing huge coastal restorations in North Carolina right now.

**[00:32:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're doing huge projects, setting up a very large project in Alabama.

**[00:33:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've worked throughout the Americas, Central and South America.

**[00:33:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's all sorts of opportunities in different geographies to leverage those different geographies for training and really building a capacity to take restoration as a primary nature-based solution package to climate and water and biodiversity and food.

**[00:33:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> And, you know, also nutrition, all this to civilization, basically.

**[00:33:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> So I've been trying to work on that and what AEI is spending out our solutions and education around some of our biggest challenges.

**[00:33:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> Climate being one, biodiversity being another food, nutritional density and, you know, we can go on and on and on.

**[00:33:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a bunch of other things.

**[00:33:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We started a new food company.

**[00:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> me with the former chairman of Whole Foods, who was the chairman for 23 years, called the Client Food Company, that's focused on not just perennializing agriculture, but using long, long-used and traditional native foods that nobody pays attention to unless it's prepared right and then you ask, what the hell is this?

**[00:34:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're commercializing.

**[00:34:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We have FDA approval for human consumption of two native perigraphs, grains, and the nutritional value, this is a reference for genuine wild rye, almost for genitus, 23 to 28 percent digestible protein, incredibly well-balanced macro and micronutrient profiles, taste profiles, which I can't taste the difference, but the chefs that we've hired can

**[00:35:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> you know say things that I never quite understand but we're introducing that into a cookie line that may be at Whole Foods and we've just released a new cookie an old cookie that was the very famous cookie here in Madison Wisconsin called the gorilla cookie and soon we'll be introducing Virginia Wilder I flower into that cookie so Katie if you if you happen down into Madison gonna go to the Willy Street co-op and get gorilla cookies which was the anti-war protester cookie of choice in the 60s Vietnam War and now it's introduced the original recipe that was lost in time and nearly extinct never said that about a cookie so I think I think you know one of the questions I had is how do we bring non-science people to

**[00:36:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> recognize value in a cookie, cookie monster restoration once the cookies are over there or banned their monsters.

**[00:36:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do we bring people to see value and want to participate in, you know, participatory learning, you know, hands-on training and also maybe on ramping, you know, less formal and more ways for people to don't go to festivals.

**[00:36:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Don't ask, don't ask.

**[00:36:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'll shut up.

**[00:36:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anyways, that's a question and how could we get the word out to bring more people to some of this training and ecological societies trying to figure out how they can offer continuing education credit CEUs so that students can, you know, into this and see value in their career track.

**[00:37:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> can also see value with their you know with their college you know the degree the credits they get but there may be other ways to bring value that you know I'm not aware of that would bring other people to the table so that's my core question and what why are we stuck to you John.

**[00:37:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting well uh we will we will consider that question momentarily is there more you want to tell us about yourself or any of your specific projects um oh there's so many it's just simply not you know there's there's so much going on so um I can tell you we're the proud parents of the latest red wolf litter that has been born on the planet we a group of us bought 15,000 acres of dewatered ditched coastal north Carolina picosan wetland

**[00:38:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> restore it and now our project is delayed for until mid-June because we have one of the only red wolf litters on the planet that's taken up residency on our this property which is a really wonderful problem to have but you know nothing wrong with delaying the restoration of hydrology in this large acreage for a couple weeks so yeah yeah there's that and then uh we we got invited to albania to look at the coastal well a couple things um our illustrious president and his family walked into albania i don't think he had a direct hand uh and they they basically said we want to do a big resort here but the national park is in the way and they changed the boundary of a dedicated national park

**[00:39:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> give that family access to prime national park land.

**[00:39:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're doing a project with architect Jeanne Gang, Studio Gang in Chicago, a MacArthur fellow that's leveraging a different way to enforce a national reserve.

**[00:39:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're not going to call it a national park.

**[00:39:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So working on a project like that and just a whole bunch of projects.

**[00:39:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Northern Great Plains adaptive multi-pedal grazing study is finding out the same things that we published and you saw in the Soil Carbon Cowboys movie movies or videos.

**[00:39:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> A bunch of so many things.

**[00:39:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's just so exciting.

**[00:39:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Steve, as I understand it, Applied Ecological Services is now a part of RES, whatever that is.

**[00:39:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it still your base of operations or is this?

**[00:39:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> No.

**[00:40:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, I in 2021 I merged applied ecological services about just under 400 staff and 19 offices into REZ and I made a commitment to stand board for two years and after one year the the non-profit work was so exciting and overwhelmingly drawing me that I retired and set up the institute and where I now call home is we my wife and I and four others bought a country club and converted it into a place called the Three Waters Reserve and it's a public a public park that we restored hired the university was constant executive chef and he runs the food and beverage service and so my bit my my office is the basement

**[00:41:00] SteveApfelbaum**

**[00:41:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's now a field station for training You know new we call it baby colleges that grow into adult ecologists and my wife Susan Lenhart and others are behind the educational programming and you know foisting that upon the world with wonderful interns that have amazing epiphanies by working in the field of restoration and Measurement and so forth So is this the Institute for Applied Ecology that you're talking about?

**[00:41:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, that it's the applied ecological Institute The Institute can you give us a URL?

**[00:41:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> I got it here.

**[00:41:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> E Institute org.

**[00:41:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah Yeah, I think the Institute for Applied Ecology is in Milbrook New York.

**[00:41:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, it's in Corvallis, Oregon Which is oh, that's right.

**[00:41:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's right.

**[00:41:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay

**[00:42:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, yeah, you know, we have a slogan in the era, we say, what can we all do together that we can't do individually, but and we'll pursue that question in a moment, but you seem to be doing it all individually, although I'm beginning to think that at this point, you've got an army behind you.

**[00:42:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not, it's not as big of a wonderful group of a family of, you know, staff and partners that I used to have.

**[00:42:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's greatly reduced and very focused on a couple of things, although it doesn't sound like it probably is based on what I just told you.

**[00:42:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's based on doing projects on the ground that inform stratifyx, which is the software app, and it's based on doing projects on the ground that that really serve as pilots and demos of take.

> on the major challenges.

**[00:43:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's what we're doing.

**[00:43:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> And trying to nail the science and nail the communication and, you know, the art.

**[00:43:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> So Peter Bick, the film producer, working with us, we're working together on the grazing stuff and the on the climate food stuff.

**[00:43:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've got another whole team of communicators that are working on on that and regenerative ag.

**[00:43:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's so many wonderful people.

**[00:43:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not a it's not all under one.

**[00:43:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's it's a wonderful growing team.

**[00:43:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you asked a specific question, which is one that we've been thrashing about ever since we started, which is, how do we somehow get more and more people to understand, you know, that this is this is the most exciting thing about being alive in this particular universe, as far as we know, that

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The future is at stake, and for the coming generation, there's really nothing.

**[00:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's no better prescription for good life than to get on and say, I have the opportunity to save the future.

**[00:44:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But to do that, they have to understand that it's true and that they really can make a difference.

**[00:44:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so how do you get the word out?

**[00:44:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're doing education, I gather, at several different levels.

**[00:44:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I saw that Mike had a comment a bit a few minutes ago.

**[00:44:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Mike, do you want to introduce yourself since you came in a little bit late?

**[00:44:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then also start the discussion about how we can help amplify the kind of work that Steve is doing and that we're all trying to do.

**[00:44:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I apologize.

**[00:44:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> I wasn't following the chat.

**[00:44:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> was trying to...

**[00:44:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, that's okay.

**[00:44:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> If there's questions.

**[00:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys.

**[00:44:56] Mike Lynn**
> No worries.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> Thank you, John.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> I apologize, everybody, for coming in late.

**[00:45:00] Mike Lynn**
> But yeah, you had mentioned you had asked the question is there a way that we could get this in front of other people for continuing education As far as at the academic level, I'm not sure but I know there are institutions that offer Training such as the things like you mentioned Matter of fact, I'm doing one for an organization next month on living shorelines that The people that attend are typically engineers Landscape architects because they come to here for whether it's an hour long to our long full day long And then they get their professional accreditation continuing education hours.

**[00:45:34] Mike Lynn**
> So that might be one avenue.

**[00:45:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's helpful for you to pursue Yeah, we we've been doing that for years with with ASLA and with the the engineering You know groups as well and doing soil bioengineering and the whole range a lot of mine reclamation a lot of river My professor was lonely appalled and river physics and hydrology

**[00:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> been teaching that and but how do you there's so many opportunities how do you build a team around the opportunities and then divide and conquer is what I'm trying to figure out and I've learned a few things you know I thought it was holy as a scientist to get you know 300 people to review a paper and Peter Peter Big it's 600,000 website hits a month on the the the grazing videos now 17 million hits so far in in like 113 countries I can't believe it I mean why do we do science papers why do we write videos seem to be so incredibly you know good interesting yeah so um

**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just want to tag a few future conversations I'd like to have with you and what we shouldn't take at the time.

**[00:47:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have, as you may know, I now know I should send it to you, a project cooking in Panama, where we've said the watershed is a strategic global importance, and that the drought from recent years had such a huge financial impact that it's a really interesting laboratory and demonstration site for trying to show that you can fix climate by fixing ecosystems.

**[00:47:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we're just beginning to get some action on the ground.

**[00:47:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We imagine that when we do that, we're going to have to mobilize lots of people to come up with solutions that better their lives and improve, have measurable impact on local climate and perhaps regional climate.

**[00:47:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it sounds like your software and your expertise might really fit in very well there, so I'll follow up with you on that.

**[00:48:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've done several projects in South America and Costa Rica that have been watershed based restoration projects that we talk about and a bunch of a bunch in North America as well.

**[00:48:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right.

**[00:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The other thing I'll mention is my own answer to the question of how do we engage young people?

**[00:48:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben and I have talked about this a lot.

**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think every school and every university on the planet has got too much pavement, too much parking lots, too much grass, not enough native species.

**[00:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lots and lots of students who are desperate to do something meaningful about the future they're told is coming and probably alumni who would like to give money for a named Miyawaki Forest or another project of that sort.

**[00:48:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would become an outdoor living laboratory and create not just a patch of research.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> stored land, but a cohort of ecosystem restores who know what to do and can fan away from their schools and get it going.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Quaqui Wildcat, one of our ERA members, and I are talking about trying to get something along these lines going, but that recipe, whether it's Miyawaki Forest or some other school-based program, I think should be part of everybody's curriculum.

**[00:49:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I don't know quite a few schools over the years.

**[00:49:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> example, we talked about Seneca Falls a little while ago, John, right in your neighborhood.

**[00:49:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> To do the 1,000-acre Seneca Meadows restoration project around Seneca Falls there, we hired high school students and they collected with us native plant species seeds for prairie wetland savanna.

**[00:50:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a forest from about a about a 30 mile radius.

**[00:50:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then we paid students and we made flats, soil, and seeds available and instructions.

**[00:50:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> And they grew the plants.

**[00:50:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> then for that restoration, we bought plants back with one stipulation that they had to come back with somebody, a relative, a parent, a friend, and plant the plant materials with us.

**[00:50:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And we've done that.

**[00:50:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did that on several mining projects, the Flambeau Mine up in Lady Smith, Wisconsin, and the Jackson County Iron Mine in Black River Falls, starting in the in the mid 80s.

**[00:50:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> And now they're public parks now, these magnificent large landscapes.

**[00:50:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've created durable relationships through that mechanism with the with the community.

**[00:51:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these because now that the families come back to see the plants, they think they planted 20 years ago.

**[00:51:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really wonderful.

**[00:51:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interesting.

**[00:51:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And where are the stories told about these programs that we all agree should be replicated to tools all over the world?

**[00:51:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Seneca Falls story is told in the Audubon Nature Center there at the Seneca Meadows preserve right south of Rochester.

**[00:51:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the stories about Flambomine is told, you can go on the Rio Tinto website, they're so proud of it.

**[00:51:39] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Wisconsin DNR tells the story about those mining projects because instead of planting it with non-native or alfalfa, which is what was originally intended, we planted them with native vegetation, prairies and savanna vegetation, they're fantastic.

**[00:52:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> They just, who are just wildlife areas now, and recreation areas.

**[00:52:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I predict Ben Rubin and I are going to go to the Seneca, what's it called again?

**[00:52:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well it's, it's the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's right on the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> You guys are 45 minutes from there, or something like that.

**[00:52:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is pretty darn close.

**[00:52:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[00:52:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Steve, welcome.

**[00:52:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Steve, it's, it's, it's an amazing, it's work.

**[00:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see you're still going strong.

**[00:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we salute you.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> A couple.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> thank you.

**[00:52:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's an honor.

**[00:52:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, go for it, Natalie.

**[00:52:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, a couple thoughts.

**[00:52:46] Natalie Fleming**
> me, the big change to get, to get people engaged, when you focus on CO2, it's pretty depressing.

**[00:52:52] Natalie Fleming**
> But if, when you focus on the assistive restoration, you can really tie it to breaking the flood drought fire cycle.

**[00:53:01] Natalie Fleming**
> The CO2 focus, CO2 centrism is to me very depressing and slow moving, but eco-restoration is pretty dramatic and powerful.

**[00:53:14] Natalie Fleming**
> There's some fun things that we can do to teach people about climate and ecosystems and, I don't know, to me paragliding.

**[00:53:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I know this sounds crazy, but you talk about peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:25] Natalie Fleming**
> Paragliders, they fly.

**[00:53:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm a pilot.

**[00:53:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> Parasailers, parasailers, they fly and they don't wait for peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:36] Natalie Fleming**
> Right.

**[00:53:37] Natalie Fleming**
> They just get out there and do it and their life depends on understanding microclimates and how the landscape relates to the climate.

**[00:53:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And I do have a picture, I pulled up a slide on where I was down in Utah and they have a spot there, so I didn't actually fly, but they let me play with a kite for a little while.

**[00:53:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Not that crazy yet, but eventually I'll get there.

**[00:54:00] Natalie Fleming**
> I think that focusing on eco restoration over CO2 centrism in the water cycle, focus on the water cycle.

**[00:54:07] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a dramatic difference and it gets people excited because you can make a difference and you can make an immediate change.

**[00:54:13] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's, I think the CO2 is so depressing that people can't get past it and they don't feel like they can really do much about it.

**[00:54:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, we've learned that people are barren by trees because they can see it, see a tree and they don't understand soil carbon.

**[00:54:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's, you know, there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> And there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the soil carbon and all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we've been focusing on is peat and soil carbon projects first and forestry carbons less so.

**[00:54:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I'm a pilot and I'm what's incredible is how violent the winds and the turbulence are now.

**[00:55:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> compared to what they were over the years that I've been flying about 25 or 30 years.

**[00:55:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there are major changes that are occurring that I feel every time I get in the airplane, most every time.

**[00:55:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> So it's very, very frightening to think about flying under some of the conditions that now as a pilot where, you you take off in one place and the prediction isn't quite what it might be projected to be when you're trying to land somewhere.

**[00:55:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[00:55:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant, you have a comment and an observation.

**[00:55:39] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:55:41] sustainavistas**
> I think if we look at the process, mean, first it's not really trees or soil or carbon.

**[00:55:48] sustainavistas**
> I think we're generally talking about changing behavior.

**[00:55:54] sustainavistas**
> And something I'd like to point to, I think Joe has probably a time for us to maybe

**[00:56:00] sustainavistas**
> for me to jump on on and give an update, because we've, so see, we are the founder of my ecological founder of our group, Courtney of Balmeneu, which is more trees now in Dutch, started 14 years ago by himself for about the first five years, challenging the local council.

**[00:56:18] sustainavistas**
> So we just outside Amsterdam Schupper Airport in probably one of the densest population urban areas.

**[00:56:26] sustainavistas**
> And in the Netherlands it started with removing 1000 school tiles and putting, rescuing one tree from a local urban forest and planting that on a thousand schools plains.

**[00:56:39] sustainavistas**
> And that went on for five years and we've now 14 years grown into an organization that's saved, rescued and donated and transplanted in the Netherlands over three million free trees, siblings.

**[00:56:52] sustainavistas**
> 30,000 volunteers and we're now going to six countries, so Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland and France, which is

**[00:57:00] sustainavistas**
> last year started a kit of a project with five ecosystem registration communities of John D.

**[00:57:05] sustainavistas**
> Liu in Ireland, sort of Cree, in Vericelle, in France, Recoviva, in Italy, in Spain, we've just come back from Altiplana and also the EFC headquarters and then obviously we're in Dutch base, so we're spending two years developing training and education materials for that.

**[00:57:27] sustainavistas**
> But if you look at what we're doing, I really think we're probably the first organisation, there's one group in France and I'll correct me if I'm wrong in Australia or the USA or Canada or any other countries that they're doing it, but we basically use nature as a nursery and basically because we use 50 centimetre to two metre high trees, that's like our sweet spot, we can do bigger trees, but that's our sweet spot and these are five to 20-year-old settings, so we really

**[00:58:00] sustainavistas**
> starting with a far better base and then in the temperate north we actually rescue and save and our survival rate is 70 to 80 percent so and it's a free resource so we do about 150 species in the Netherlands and I think that so twice it's really mass participation of communities connecting people to nature and showing them an ecological solution as well as people can actually really scale so I mean this is probably one of the most incredible scalable solutions that's and and and so we would love people we if you look at our more trees now dot eco website we've got a whole communication toolkit we show our manuals our hands everything we've translated four languages but also we give it all away for nothing so have a look at that and I think it could be interesting to use that because if you can I mean we in the winter in our little area near airport skipway airport our biggest tree have we risked 140 000 trees and gave them away for free if we and that's any

**[00:59:00] sustainavistas**
> every day, every day for six months, 10, 20 year volunteers working on it, but if we got paid people, we got thousands of people to do this, and we could do it in 20 or 30 countries, we basically could really ramp up the carbon sequestration, but also change behavior, basically, and really.

**[00:59:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:59:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Grant, you have reminded me that it is indeed time for an update from you.

**[00:59:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll follow up for a report.

**[00:59:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you're right.

**[00:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You have a solution which has scaled and rallied tens of thousands of people.

**[00:59:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We really are in a planet with 8 billion.

**[00:59:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let's see how we can scale that up and then we spread the word.

**[00:59:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> think replicable models is really what we're all looking for in transferability to other systems.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yep.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Exactly.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you.

**[00:59:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you're in the Netherlands.

**[00:59:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> Did I hear that right?

**[00:59:56] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:57] sustainavistas**
> I'm actually looking...

**[01:00:00] sustainavistas**
> My son is, I'm actually in Canada, Quebec for a week, I'm actually looking at starting some trials up in Canada because I've just become a grandparent, so we'll be coming to Canada two or three times a year probably.

**[01:00:12] sustainavistas**
> So our first grandchild was just born in Montreal 19 days ago, so yeah, so I'm actually on a 20 hectare property, so I think this might be one of the first treehouses in Canada.

**[01:00:26] sustainavistas**
> So yeah, let's not take too much more time, but I think let's have a conversation in parallel.

**[01:00:37] sustainavistas**
> One other quick question to the group in order to join, do you know any members that are going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:47] sustainavistas**
> No, I do not.

**[01:00:48] sustainavistas**
> Okay, I'll put that in the email tomorrow, but if you can't follow that, it's probably often New York and London climate week is probably one of the highest profiles, about 40,000.

**[01:01:00] sustainavistas**
> And people go to Paris for three days and it's a really an epic event and a lot of submissions that got a lot of those solutions there and ecosystem restoration is a real big, okay, thanks guys.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thank you, Brett.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, great.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> It sounds like a way to think about transferability of the, you know, the, the.

**[01:01:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> How you change the behavior and less so what you're planning and unless that's critical, but to work across different ecosystems, that'd be great.

**[01:01:32] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, exactly.

**[01:01:33] sustainavistas**
> I mean, for example, one of the small projects, sorry, John, just we start, we kicked off this year, we did an eco fitness.

**[01:01:38] sustainavistas**
> So basically, not only working on the ecological fitness of the forest and the land, but we also work on the fitness and the health and mental fitness people at the same time.

**[01:01:47] sustainavistas**
> So we kick sort of that off this year.

**[01:01:49] sustainavistas**
> So there's some videos on that.

**[01:01:50] sustainavistas**
> That's why it was a bit of fun, but actually we have to pick it up.

**[01:01:53] sustainavistas**
> So we work from November to March for the trees at the moment.

**[01:01:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's basically our model.

**[01:01:57] sustainavistas**
> That's great.

**[01:01:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:01:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:02:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie, you just switched off your camera, but I'm hoping this is your moment to give us your presentation.

**[01:02:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, my friend just came out to see if I wanted some chicken that's a little bit too spicy for me.

**[01:02:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And to see if the kids in the dog can come out and play.

**[01:02:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, did you just say you wanted me to do the presentation now?

**[01:02:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I did.

**[01:02:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I did.

**[01:02:22] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, hopefully I don't start coughing like a crazy one.

**[01:02:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:02:27] Natalie Fleming**
> So, if you've followed me at all on LinkedIn, you know that I obsessed about the water cycle.

**[01:02:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think all problems I'll call every all the problems and ecosystems are caused by bare grounds and bare ground and lack of life.

**[01:02:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I blame everything on the desert and I blame everything on mineral dust just so you know just about.

**[01:02:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I had the opportunity to spend the winter in Salt Lake and it was pretty exciting for me to go back to Salt Lake.

**[01:02:58] Natalie Fleming**
> It is kind of the land of my children.

**[01:03:00] Natalie Fleming**
> sensitivity.

**[01:03:02] Natalie Fleming**
> When I started out in life, lived in the Utah Valley along the Wasatch Front.

**[01:03:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And if you've been paying attention, they have a terrible crisis now where they have the great drought.

**[01:03:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I first got down there in October, I was able to stay on Mount Olympus.

**[01:03:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Olympus looking over the valley and it was absolutely beautiful.

**[01:03:29] Natalie Fleming**
> This picture right here is from there.

**[01:03:32] Natalie Fleming**
> on the mountain side, it has a beautiful forest on the mountain side.

**[01:03:39] Natalie Fleming**
> If you're not familiar with the landscaping of the Great Salt Lake, you've got, as the winds come in from the west, you've got a lot of bare ground.

**[01:03:48] Natalie Fleming**
> You have the salt flats, you have the Great Salt Lake, and then you have these massive huge, I should have written down the exact height of the mountains and to Mount Tipinogus and all these Mount Olympus, they're huge.

**[01:04:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or gargantuan.

**[01:04:02] Natalie Fleming**
> And these mountains are amazing because they really trap in, they have the potential to trap in the moisture.

**[01:04:09] Natalie Fleming**
> But they have been denuding and ripping landscaping and plants out over the last 20 or 30 years.

**[01:04:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I was there 30 years ago, there were orchards and lawns and conifers and deciduous.

**[01:04:27] Natalie Fleming**
> There were all manner of life was there.

**[01:04:30] Natalie Fleming**
> And because the community is trapped between the mountain and the lake, there's very little room for growth.

**[01:04:38] Natalie Fleming**
> And so they've been denuding it.

**[01:04:41] Natalie Fleming**
> as strangely, the rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Thanks.

**[01:04:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I'm going to try this chicken in a minute.

**[01:04:49] Natalie Fleming**
> The rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:52] Natalie Fleming**
> so the solution was to denude the earth some more and rip out more trees and grasses and shrubs.

**[01:04:58] Natalie Fleming**
> And after a minute,

**[01:05:00] Natalie Fleming**
> official of the neighbors.

**[01:05:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, those are some domesticated teenagers.

**[01:05:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Just a second here.

**[01:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're not hearing much of your background.

**[01:05:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, I can hear it.

**[01:05:19] Natalie Fleming**
> I was screaming at him.

**[01:05:22] Natalie Fleming**
> It's a subdivision here.

**[01:05:24] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a full neighborhood going on.

**[01:05:26] Natalie Fleming**
> So they've been denuding the earth and ripping out landscaping and trees.

**[01:05:31] Natalie Fleming**
> The cities have been paying people to rip out vegetation in order to save the water.

**[01:05:40] Natalie Fleming**
> The Great Salt Lake strike team, and their plan to save the lake is to direct all water from the watershed directly to the lake and skip any vegetation in the landscape along the way.

**[01:05:55] Natalie Fleming**
> So I found out three hours ago I'd be doing this presentation.

**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So can I can I share?

**[01:06:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes please.

**[01:06:03] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay so um desktop one you're going to see all my stuff here all the kids um here is a video I wasn't able to export this video to the right format so uh this is the rocks that they are landscaping with now there used to be vegetation here and ripped it out in order to not use water their focus is is stopping water usage they don't understand the water cycle not used so they put in this rock landscaping and you can hear the highway this is the landscaping that they've put in and while I was driving around the valley I would stop and take pictures and videos as I went along and I was just horrified so you see these rocks we see the tree above ahead um this is a you know you're looking at a quarter mile of rocks and as I step into the trees you're going to see what they ripped out to save water

**[01:07:01] Natalie Fleming**
> And you're going to see, you know, six foot tall grasses, trees, shrubs, and a little small riparian area.

**[01:07:08] Natalie Fleming**
> I had the sound on, you would hear the birds chirping.

**[01:07:12] Natalie Fleming**
> And this whole area is next to the lake.

**[01:07:16] Natalie Fleming**
> It's between the lake and Jordan River.

**[01:07:18] Natalie Fleming**
> And they ripped down all this vegetation.

**[01:07:21] Natalie Fleming**
> And I have videos of the machines continuing to rip out more and more vegetation.

**[01:07:25] Natalie Fleming**
> There is very little of this left.

**[01:07:29] Natalie Fleming**
> So this is, of course, a month ago.

**[01:07:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So the spring hasn't come yet.

**[01:07:33] Natalie Fleming**
> I should probably go back in a month when it's all green.

**[01:07:38] Natalie Fleming**
> But they've just ripped this all out and the soil was rich and thick and soft and moist.

**[01:07:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And these are the tall pompous grass that they have.

**[01:07:47] Natalie Fleming**
> And they're ripping this out to save the water and to conserve water, because this is obviously using water.

**[01:07:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And they don't even understand that water is not used, water is cycled.

**[01:08:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, um, it's pretty horrific.

**[01:08:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, sorry, let's put that over here.

**[01:08:05] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Let's see.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> How are we going to go to slide show, uh, please start.

**[01:08:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:13] Natalie Fleming**
> So I threw this together real quick.

**[01:08:15] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, there's a picture.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> The great.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it is a shrunk exponentially.

**[01:08:21] Natalie Fleming**
> How do I go to the next?

**[01:08:23] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, I gotta move you guys over where I can't see you anymore.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> I think.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> Because you're, I can't say anything.

**[01:08:30] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, there we go.

**[01:08:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's in the 1980s.

**[01:08:33] Natalie Fleming**
> was about 3000 square miles.

**[01:08:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And now it's down to 150.

**[01:08:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's down to less than a third of what it was before.

**[01:08:40] Natalie Fleming**
> And as the lake shrinks, um, they've got some serious problems.

**[01:08:48] Natalie Fleming**
> One of the next to the lake, this is I, I am LDS and we build chapels everywhere and under advisement of the local community.

**[01:08:57] Natalie Fleming**
> They were advised to landscape in this manner.

**[01:09:00] Natalie Fleming**
> To use rocks and I compare using rocks as landscaping as using skulls and bones to landscape rocks are the are the skull.

**[01:09:08] Natalie Fleming**
> They're the structure of the earth and the soil and the trees.

**[01:09:12] Natalie Fleming**
> That is the flesh of the earth.

**[01:09:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So imagine just ripping the flesh off of your arm, which is grotesque and expecting the blood to flow and it's not flowing.

**[01:09:20] Natalie Fleming**
> So we know from Zach wise and water stories about Lancaster and all these wonderful people that you're supposed to sink slow and spread the water and then get as much vegetation as you can out of it to get the body pump going.

**[01:09:33] Natalie Fleming**
> And as you can see this particular structure, they've done the opposite.

**[01:09:38] Natalie Fleming**
> The tall this next right next to this was seven foot tall pompous grass that was ripped out and this is right.

**[01:09:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is Lakefront property.

**[01:09:46] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was water conservation gone wrong.

**[01:09:50] Natalie Fleming**
> If we do not have plants, you're not going to have rain.

**[01:09:54] Natalie Fleming**
> lot of people think the plants come because of the rain, but it's just like the chicken and the egg.

**[01:10:00] Natalie Fleming**
> to have vegetation and plants and great soil to keep the biotic pump going.

**[01:10:04] Natalie Fleming**
> I need to explain the bi...

**[01:10:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I can't let me put you back up there.

**[01:10:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I don't think you do actually.

**[01:10:09] Natalie Fleming**
> I do it.

**[01:10:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Everybody here gets it.

**[01:10:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[01:10:11] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:10:12] Natalie Fleming**
> can skip, so I don't have to explain the biotic pump.

**[01:10:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I can do that, but I think you guys are all versed in it.

**[01:10:19] Natalie Fleming**
> So the water cycle is completely biological in line out.

**[01:10:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And it's transpiration as an engine.

**[01:10:27] Natalie Fleming**
> so you all know about Pseudonose, Miserengi, and other mushroom spores and pollens that cloud seed at warm temperatures.

**[01:10:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So I don't need to explain that to you.

**[01:10:38] Natalie Fleming**
> So all of this, you already know?

**[01:10:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I think we are, we're here because we all share the same basic understanding.

**[01:10:48] Natalie Fleming**
> So here is the view from the place I was initially staying at.

**[01:10:51] Natalie Fleming**
> it's just beautiful, these mountains, and there's a great biodiversity of trees.

**[01:10:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And my plan for the Great Salt Lake would be to harvest all of the seeds,

**[01:11:00] Natalie Fleming**
> on this and set up nurseries and the mountains on the other side of the valley are barren.

**[01:11:06] Natalie Fleming**
> And so if we took the trees and expanded the forestry system, but they're cutting down trees, they're cutting down conifers because they all use water.

**[01:11:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it was very heartbreaking to see.

**[01:11:20] Natalie Fleming**
> the ancient Amazonians, they used the mountains to their advantage to trap in the as the clouds came in, as the moisture came in, they created water retention landscapes and built structures to really maximize vegetation and trap the water in.

**[01:11:35] Natalie Fleming**
> the Great Salt Lake in the Wasatch Front, that area has a great advantage with that great mountain that could trap in an incredible amount of water.

**[01:11:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is what I saw everywhere where by mandate the trees, the homes were built with rock landscaping, which to me is kind of like Terminator where they're walking on the skulls.

**[01:11:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the bones of the earth.

**[01:12:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Can you explain to you how and why?

**[01:12:02] Natalie Fleming**
> they're just directoring all vegetation over.

**[01:12:05] Natalie Fleming**
> then the lake has the lake bed because it does not drain anywhere else.

**[01:12:12] Natalie Fleming**
> It has a lot of arsenic lead in mercury and selenium that as it dries out, it's kicking that dust.

**[01:12:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And the ice nucleating temperatures of that dust, meaning its rainfall potential is very, very low.

**[01:12:25] Natalie Fleming**
> It has to be super, super, super cold in order for it to stimulate rainfall.

**[01:12:28] Natalie Fleming**
> So that's super bad.

**[01:12:32] Natalie Fleming**
> It was super depressing for me to see this because when I left, there were orchards and herds and all sorts of things.

**[01:12:38] Natalie Fleming**
> this unleashing pollutants, there's a health crisis because of the asthma and heart disease.

**[01:12:43] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got arsenic in the air.

**[01:12:46] Natalie Fleming**
> They've convinced a lot of local farmers to redirect water from the farm to the lake.

**[01:12:53] Natalie Fleming**
> And they think it's gonna help.

**[01:12:54] Natalie Fleming**
> So you already know what temperature, okay, don't need to give you that.

**[01:12:59] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:13:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, this is a view, a picture I took this winter when the snow was there and you can see that from the side of the mountain, you can see the clouds forming and rumbling on this side.

**[01:13:12] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on that.

**[01:13:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on any of this.

**[01:13:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So, on the right is a picture of what I, I took both these pictures.

**[01:13:22] Natalie Fleming**
> These were side by side.

**[01:13:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And on the right, this is along a riverbed, the Jordan River.

**[01:13:28] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping out massive amounts.

**[01:13:30] Natalie Fleming**
> I could show you the whole video of them piling up the dirt and shipping it off and then saying, we're having a drought.

**[01:13:36] Natalie Fleming**
> I just don't know why.

**[01:13:37] Natalie Fleming**
> if they, yeah, I don't know the polite way to tell them they're all stupid.

**[01:13:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> Natalie, did you see any good examples of landscaping that might be nothing at all?

**[01:13:53] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping everything out that they consider the rock landscaping is good.

**[01:13:57] Natalie Fleming**
> This right here.

**[01:13:58] Natalie Fleming**
> This isn't Saratoga Springs.

**[01:14:00] Natalie Fleming**
> If you look closely, those are logs.

**[01:14:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the only trees I found in that area when I was driving all of that particular area.

**[01:14:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the logs.

**[01:14:10] Natalie Fleming**
> They were building new subdivisions.

**[01:14:11] Natalie Fleming**
> They're building massive, massive subdivisions and they obviously they cut down some tree.

**[01:14:17] Natalie Fleming**
> But the focus is that that uses water.

**[01:14:20] Natalie Fleming**
> They're really obsessed with removing anything that uses water.

**[01:14:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Natalie, do you talk, do you give this presentation in Salt Lake City?

**[01:14:33] Natalie Fleming**
> No, I made this presentation an hour ago for tonight.

**[01:14:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you?

**[01:14:38] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact these people.

**[01:14:40] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email address.

**[01:14:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact Brian Stede.

**[01:14:43] Natalie Fleming**
> He is at the University of Utah.

**[01:14:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I got a really good reference person, really top notch person.

**[01:14:49] Natalie Fleming**
> He me the reference.

**[01:14:50] Natalie Fleming**
> He didn't really return the calls.

**[01:14:52] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email addresses of everybody on the right team.

**[01:14:55] Natalie Fleming**
> everybody, I don't know how to approach them without being a jerk, really, without telling them they're.

**[01:15:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Scrooming things up because who am I and they're hydrologists and geologists and all these.

**[01:15:05] Natalie Fleming**
> These are university hydrologists, but PhDs and post PhDs and teach at the university and who am I to go and tell them they're.

**[01:15:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> You know, the, the LDS church, we worked on the city creek.

**[01:15:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, the, uh, the mall, we were the folks that brought.

**[01:15:22] SteveApfelbaum**
> Uh, city creek to the surface that runs to the mall.

**[01:15:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the, the for profit arm.

**[01:15:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the foundation arm of the Mormon church.

**[01:15:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, very focused on the water desert ranch million acre ranch.

**[01:15:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're trying to figure out how to, you know, I wonder if the LDS angle rather than.

**[01:15:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Going to the city would be worth doing.

**[01:15:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> then the other angle is, um, we're working with the CEO of, uh, who bought big power mountain.

**[01:16:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's 20,000 acres.

**[01:16:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's really interested in setting a regional example of how to restore the water cycle.

**[01:16:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was really trying to get to eco of the ag reserves, which is the for business entity.

**[01:16:16] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was unable to break through and I am LDS and I've talked to my bishop.

**[01:16:22] Natalie Fleming**
> said, who do I talk to other than embarrass the church on LinkedIn, which I did.

**[01:16:27] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, maybe you can help me if you have the contacts.

**[01:16:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Send me an email and I'll see if the contacts are still viable.

**[01:16:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because we worked with them for six or seven years.

**[01:16:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I lived in Roosevelt, Utah and became very close with leaders in the church.

**[01:16:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because there's so many Jack Mormons and Roosevelt, they were afraid they were going to lose the tribe out there.

**[01:16:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So he even went after little Jewish boys like me to indoctrinate us.

**[01:17:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Just so you know, Jack Mormons are Mormons that don't quite abide.

**[01:17:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> No, I know that.

**[01:17:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I know that.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Oh, I know.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> I just saw everybody else listening.

**[01:17:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> I know what a Jack Mormon is.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> You're from the mountainside.

**[01:17:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So when I was there for the first month, I didn't understand why the lake was shrinking because I didn't actually go through the valley the first month.

**[01:17:20] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I've got some great shots.

**[01:17:21] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was good.

**[01:17:24] Natalie Fleming**
> The landowner actually wanted to clear something.

**[01:17:25] Natalie Fleming**
> So you can see a lot of bare ground that here with this forest, the mountain sides don't have many trees over there.

**[01:17:32] Natalie Fleming**
> And there were certain sides that had more trees.

**[01:17:35] Natalie Fleming**
> So these are the beautiful views that I got to see.

**[01:17:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I guess that's the end of that.

**[01:17:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> And those are big fire scars.

**[01:17:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those aren't from logging.

**[01:17:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those are wildfire scars from the early 20s and 1910.

**[01:17:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did the master plan for the open space system for Salt Lake City.

**[01:17:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's really interesting how fires played a big role.

**[01:17:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ranching and early fires.

**[01:18:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, if, if I'll send you my information, if you can help in there, there's several different, I could tell you all the stories of all the ways I tried to get in and try to reach the right people.

**[01:18:12] Natalie Fleming**
> But I do have the list of email address of everybody on the great Salt Lake strike team, but I have hesitated to email them because who is Natalie Fleming to go in and tell them.

**[01:18:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Natalie Fleming is now acquainted with Steve Applebaum, who it turns out has got roots in the area.

**[01:18:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if it is Natalie's diagnosis, roughly correct that they're doing almost exactly the wrong thing if they want to turn this around.

**[01:18:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're desertifying the area and not building capacity for water retention and for in the soil system and for lagging the runoff, the hydrograph.

**[01:18:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everything's running off the land so quickly.

**[01:18:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So yeah, it's the right, it's the right thing, but the church isn't easy to do.

**[01:19:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> to unless you get to the for-profit arm because they're paying for a lot of these problems.

**[01:19:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're, you know, the community suffering, the erosion and infrastructure damages are really significantly expensive.

**[01:19:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So I'm pretty distressed because at church they announced that they're going to do this great program to reduce vegetation on all the churches across the world and I want to go to them.

**[01:19:23] Natalie Fleming**
> I know they're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do this and I'm like who do I tell them that because Brigham Young taught us we're supposed to make the earth as a garden of Eden not Mars and that picture there of everything's going dark on me all of a sudden.

**[01:19:40] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:20:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Go, Rob.

**[01:20:09] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Well, wow, what a great presentation.

**[01:20:12] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> thank you so much for what you're doing and a couple things.

**[01:20:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> One, in terms of who is Natalie Fleming, you may have to go to small groups of people and spread your story.

**[01:20:24] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And then Natalie Fleming will be someone with 100 angry citizens behind her.

**[01:20:28] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> That makes a big difference in whether city officials will listen.

**[01:20:33] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> the main thing I want to mention is when you mentioned the rains disappearing and as he described that situation, I was hearing me on over and over.

**[01:20:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Nicely, the situation he described.

**[01:20:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> He talked about the carrier component and the trigger component.

**[01:20:53] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And the carrier component is the moisture that comes in from a larger system.

**[01:20:58] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Mediterranean sea in the case of Mediterranean sea.

**[01:21:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> But it sounds like it's the sea in Salt Lake.

**[01:21:07] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> It's Salt Lake that's providing the moisture, and then you have the trigger, which is the vegetation.

**[01:21:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So they're reproducing the desertification, as Steve said, but in a particular way, very similar to what Mian was talking about.

**[01:21:26] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And, of course, it was always kind of assumed that he was referring to situations in Mediterranean climate, and they tended to be coastal situations, but this points to this happening in any kind of climate, and inland.

**[01:21:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So, yeah, my mind is kind of blowing up.

**[01:21:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> This is amazing what you're doing, and never doubt yourself.

**[01:21:54] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> I mean, who is Natalie Fleming?

**[01:21:56] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> She's this amazing woman who has figured all this stuff out.

**[01:22:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> and is just getting a start, start, yeah, please.

**[01:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I think he's right, Natalie, you mentioned today that you're thinking about politics, but I actually think that your best path to politics might well be to really say, this is who Natalie Fleming is on this topic.

**[01:22:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's only going to become more and more clear that you were right and that you had the courage to say it.

**[01:22:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it actually, I think, would give you a very distinctive brand as a politician if you led with that.

**[01:22:41] Natalie Fleming**
> And this form of environmentalism is agreeable to both sides, both the left and the right politically.

**[01:22:49] Natalie Fleming**
> But one exciting thing for me is if we can get the LDS church on board is that LDS church has properties all over the world and they have a missionary mindset and they have missionaries all over the world.

**[01:23:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, and the missionaries are required to put it in a certain number of hours of service in their community, wherever they are.

**[01:23:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And that is non, non, across the lighting service.

**[01:23:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:23:10] Natalie Fleming**
> And so, getting these youth, getting the youth trained before they go on emissions on this stuff.

**[01:23:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is one thing.

**[01:23:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:23:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The one thing we can do together that we can't do individually is to have Natalie compare notes with Steve and to Steve see if he can find a way in based on the fact that he.

**[01:23:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Maybe in preservation and restoration rather than in landscaping and tree cutting.

**[01:23:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can definitely try to help Natalie.

**[01:24:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> in some of the neighborhoods, unfortunately the more affluent neighborhoods in Salt Lake City on the on the school below the bench, there's people doing native landscaping and there's people doing graywater management.

**[01:24:18] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:24:25] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:25:05] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:25:10] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anything that doesn't have the reflectivity, the albedo and the heating capacity and the imperviousness that they're creating would be better and unfortunately lawn is better than what they're doing, but it's not much better.

**[01:25:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> But yeah, we could talk about that further.

**[01:25:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've written a couple of papers on the role of landscapes in water management that might be useful.

**[01:25:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Not on the Jordan River, but we've looked at the changes in river flow over about 100 years and increasing increasing amount of runoff and increasing low flows of increased

**[01:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> 400 times over historic low flows and the displaying the river in the Chicago region, median flows have increased if I recall about 250 times on average over historic flows and the high flow events are three to five times the historic high flow flood events.

**[01:26:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's in a paper we did with Leopold.

**[01:26:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we're doing is we've flip-flopped the hydrology at the watershed scale from a groundwater recharge and infiltration and very long lag time.

**[01:26:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> The lag is the time period between the center of the mass of the rainfall distribution, the center of the mass of the runoff distribution hydrograph.

**[01:26:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've converted recharge-based systems into surface runoff based systems and it's every urban watershed.

**[01:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's very few that that hasn't happened to, and virtually every agricultural watershed, the same thing has happened.

**[01:27:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the story is very well understood, but what's not understood in urban areas, at least in the West, in Salt Lake, a lot of the people there are new customers, and they're interested in high dollar houses with minimal landscaping.

**[01:27:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's part of what the Netflix owner at Big Powder Mountain wants to get across to the people moving into these 20 million dollar homes.

**[01:27:41] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, one of the things that set me is that the church in good faith has donated hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water to go from the farmland to skip the farmland and go direct to the lake.

**[01:28:11] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got to keep everything flowing.

**[01:28:14] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, thank you.

**[01:28:15] Natalie Fleming**
> I would love to speak with you, Steve, if we can get some.

**[01:28:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, I'd be glad.

**[01:28:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some other really critical issues that nobody knows about there, except the FAA, the white pelicans that nest out on, I can't remember the island, Pelican Island is what we called it.

**[01:28:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now they're feeding at the mouth of the Jordan River and the marshes.

**[01:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> And every day, they're soaring right across the approach to the Salt Lake City airport.

**[01:28:44] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:29:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some big issues that because of the shrinking lake.

**[01:29:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, three months from now, I would like to hear a re-presentation by Natalie and Steve about the plan to reform Salt Lake and what comes of it.

**[01:29:47] Mike Lynn**
> Yes, thank you.

**[01:29:48] Mike Lynn**
> Natalie, you mentioned about the challenge of going into somebody when you they have the you have the opinion that they have their science that is backing them up.

**[01:29:56] Mike Lynn**
> There's a significant body of literature in the scientific space.

**[01:30:00] Mike Lynn**
> peer-reviewed literature that says the exact opposite.

**[01:30:03] Mike Lynn**
> So I think going in armed with that, if you foresee, if you anticipate them throwing out whatever things there are, there is a significant body of peer-reviewed literature that says what they're doing is not the way to do it.

**[01:30:18] Mike Lynn**
> That's all I have.

**[01:30:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Thank you.

**[01:30:19] Natalie Fleming**
> Thank you.

**[01:30:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**

> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[01:52:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Send me an email or click the link.

**[01:52:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see you again soon.

**[01:53:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys for the wonderful conversation.

**[01:53:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

*Line 161347:*
```
**[00:20:05] Ben Rubin**
> Say hello now, if he would.

**[00:20:08] Ben Rubin**
> Sure.

**[00:20:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm here in Rochester, New York, working in the public school system teaching visual arts the last three years, sort of jumping into the hot seat.

**[00:20:22] Ben Rubin**
> There was a big shortage after the pandemic, so it was kind of a career change opportunity, before that worked with John Scholl with the Enable Project, so the three Princeton prosthetics spent a number of years in Southeast Asia working on different projects related to education, I guess in terms of tonight, what I'm going to share is a plan for taking one of the unused outdoor spaces at the school where I teach.

**[00:21:00] Ben Rubin**
> and turning it into an outdoor classroom, basically a nature peace classroom.

**[00:21:06] Ben Rubin**
> There was a small grant that I got over the summer to do some training and get certified with some different strategies on that.

**[00:21:15] Ben Rubin**
> I figured I'd just share it's a small project, but I can share that and get some ideas from all of you.

**[00:21:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:21:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:21:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The incomparable Indie Singh is here.

**[00:21:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you turn on your video and say hello?

**[00:21:29] indy singh**
> Of course.

**[00:21:30] indy singh**
> Hey guys.

**[00:21:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's up?

**[00:21:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How are you doing?

**[00:21:37] indy singh**
> Faze right now.

**[00:21:38] indy singh**
> How do I do this?

**[00:21:40] indy singh**
> Should I land first or should I keep the spaceship?

**[00:21:44] indy singh**
> What's up everybody?

**[00:21:46] indy singh**
> I hope you all are doing well.

**[00:21:48] indy singh**
> Thank you all for all the restoration work.

**[00:21:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indie, think you're going behind the moon right now.

**[00:21:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> You're breaking up.

**[00:22:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Alright, let's see.

**[00:22:01] indy singh**
> Let's see, let's see, let's see.

**[00:22:02] indy singh**
> Let's see if you guys can hear me now.

**[00:22:04] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, we got a flavor for Indy.

**[00:22:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indy, I've noticed you've been really active.

**[00:22:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> seems like you really got something great going on.

**[00:22:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'd like an update, but your connectivity is not good at this moment.

**[00:22:16] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> looks like everything was really high right now on my end.

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure?

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> bit more.

**[00:22:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can mention, Katie and Ben, that our ritual here at the ERA, which may change soon, is that ERA members become ERA members when they introduce themselves at a town hall meeting, which you have now done.

**[00:22:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a week later, assuming there are no objections, you've become full-fledged members with all the rights and responsibilities, too, which really basically just include checking in every so often, subscribing to our social media, findable through our website, and then

**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Passing on social media that resonate with you when you think would resonate with your network To other people in your network.

**[00:23:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It is also possible to Donate to the ERA.

**[00:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's a link on our website, and I am laboring mightily to try to get a Majority of our members to become recurring donors at whatever level they would like even a dollar a month because that It's a good thing and it actually tells us a little something about what we can count on All I'm going through routine issues here, I will mention that we do have our annual general meeting next month on May 14th, I believe and in preparation for that We're all Trying to assess what has happened since a year ago, and I am now putting into the chat a form Where Natalie

**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> mentioned that he just published a book, and Steve can mention that he just published a book, and Rob can mention that he just published another article, and we will try to bring all of that together in time from May 14th.

**[00:24:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, well, you will of course give our speakers your undivided attention.

**[00:24:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> I urge you to click the link.

**[00:24:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This form is basically untested, and see if you can put some information in it, and then I'll know if it works because I'm going be sending it to everybody in the ERA, all four to five hundred of us.

**[00:24:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:24:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First guest and speaker and soon-to-be ERA member is Steve Apfelbaum, a book of whose I have in my living room, and I started quite some time ago when I heard about him through Bio4Climate, and apparently the author of many books with more to come.

**[00:24:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Steve, give us your story, please.

**[00:24:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well, where do I start?

**[00:25:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, as a young child, nature was my passion, my bliss, uh, rehabilitating injured and raising baby animals was, uh, I did and was on a veterinary medicine tract to work with wild animals and, uh, and in vet school and a professor said, Hey, you love canoeing in wilderness.

**[00:25:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's a grant to do some research in a wilderness area.

**[00:25:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I said, Oh, wow, you mean like not having to take care of dogs and city cats?

**[00:25:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it turned out we got the grant and spent basically fast forward 40 years of staying the fire ecology of the boundary water, wilderness, and Quedicope Provincial Park couldn't be

**[00:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Northeastern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario and basically went on to graduate school as a result of that opportunity.

**[00:26:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> And my whole life has been focused on studying the healthiest ecosystems on the planet, measuring biodiversity, a whole range of functions, publishing technical articles, learning what we can from those systems and then emulating that and bringing that into design in urban systems and rural systems.

**[00:26:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So learning from caribou and bison and working with grazing systems, the soil carbon cowboy series that you may or may not have heard about, that's our work with Alan Williams and Gabe Brown.

**[00:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a whole bunch of people.

**[00:27:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now we've worked on about 100 million acres bringing improved grazing and provided the science and are continuing to expand on the climate mitigation opportunities and the biodiversity mitigation opportunities.

**[00:27:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That introduced me to the need for translating the science into market language.

**[00:27:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We put together in 2009 with Ratan Lal and a number of the top soil scientists on the planet, a carbon measurement protocol that became a global standard.

**[00:27:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Vera published it as VM0021.

**[00:27:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've subsequently converted that into a family of standards called the Regenerative Standard.

**[00:27:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> And last year alone, we have with project developers

**[00:28:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for about a million acres of improved grazing in North America and were on a track to hit 20 to 30 million acres in five or six years.

**[00:28:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> One of the things that we learned during the process of trying to work at landscape scales and get the science right and get the policy right and get the market right and get the trust and transparency right, was that there was no way to ecological literacy across any of those subjects.

**[00:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we spun out a company.

**[00:28:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> I retired from my company, Applied Ecological Services, about in 2021 and spun up a non-profit called Applied Ecological Institute.

**[00:28:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm Wisconsin based, Katie.

**[00:28:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're in southern Wisconsin.

**[00:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these heads.

**[00:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that organization has started a new company called Stratifix, which is a subscriber SaaS-based business that is basically bringing 200 or more datasets and mapping capabilities to any piece of land in the U.S.

**[00:29:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> currently and North America, less detailed.

**[00:29:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> But you can look at any piece of property.

**[00:29:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll immediately have the land ownership and all sorts of other amazing data, assessed value, value of improvements.

**[00:29:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then there's nearly 200 natural resource datasets that you can apply to that property.

**[00:29:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can do scenario planning for evaluating different land uses, whether it be restoration,

**[00:30:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for agricultural practices, adapt to multi-pedic grazing versus continuous conventional no-till versus whatever pillage.

**[00:30:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can evaluate different crops.

**[00:30:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you could do highest and best value optimization using actual real-time spot pricing for the commodities and all the NASS USDA data sets with the average soil yields and the economics for every county in the US.

**[00:30:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So that's spun up and that's really helping us do restoration at scale, including we used it to do about a billion and a half acre prioritization of all the grassland restoration opportunities in North America.

**[00:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's now being used by the voluntary carbon market by a number of players to go out and secure.

**[00:31:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or the landowner partnering relationships to do the improved grazing.

**[00:31:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a lot of that stuff that I've been working on.

**[00:31:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Education is kind of what brought me to contact you, John.

**[00:31:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> I've been teaching for about 12 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, co-teaching a class on the future of coastal ecosystems on the planet.

**[00:31:26] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then with COVID, I kind of retired from that job because it was no fun teaching over Zoom.

**[00:31:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, the personal relationships and the field work with the students is what really kind of made everything work well.

**[00:31:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> But there's an incredible unmet demand for bringing ecosystem restoration to not just the landowners that may have no technical training and what they want is, you know, how to

**[00:32:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do I do this?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do first?

**[00:32:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> What's it going to cost?

**[00:32:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> What are the downsides?

**[00:32:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, what are my decisions and how significant are they or can I grow into it lightly and kind of learn along the route?

**[00:32:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what I've proposed to the ecological society is a series of two-hour primers which I've already been teaching.

**[00:32:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> I did two of them in the past month with them and then a six or a 12-hour online class and then one week classes in the field in various places around the starting here in Wisconsin, southern Wisconsin.

**[00:32:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> we're doing huge coastal restorations in North Carolina right now.

**[00:32:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're doing huge projects, setting up a very large project in Alabama.

**[00:33:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've worked throughout the Americas, Central and South America.

**[00:33:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's all sorts of opportunities in different geographies to leverage those different geographies for training and really building a capacity to take restoration as a primary nature-based solution package to climate and water and biodiversity and food.

**[00:33:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> And, you know, also nutrition, all this to civilization, basically.

**[00:33:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> So I've been trying to work on that and what AEI is spending out our solutions and education around some of our biggest challenges.

**[00:33:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> Climate being one, biodiversity being another food, nutritional density and, you know, we can go on and on and on.

**[00:33:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a bunch of other things.

**[00:33:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We started a new food company.

**[00:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> me with the former chairman of Whole Foods, who was the chairman for 23 years, called the Client Food Company, that's focused on not just perennializing agriculture, but using long, long-used and traditional native foods that nobody pays attention to unless it's prepared right and then you ask, what the hell is this?

**[00:34:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're commercializing.

**[00:34:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We have FDA approval for human consumption of two native perigraphs, grains, and the nutritional value, this is a reference for genuine wild rye, almost for genitus, 23 to 28 percent digestible protein, incredibly well-balanced macro and micronutrient profiles, taste profiles, which I can't taste the difference, but the chefs that we've hired can

**[00:35:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> you know say things that I never quite understand but we're introducing that into a cookie line that may be at Whole Foods and we've just released a new cookie an old cookie that was the very famous cookie here in Madison Wisconsin called the gorilla cookie and soon we'll be introducing Virginia Wilder I flower into that cookie so Katie if you if you happen down into Madison gonna go to the Willy Street co-op and get gorilla cookies which was the anti-war protester cookie of choice in the 60s Vietnam War and now it's introduced the original recipe that was lost in time and nearly extinct never said that about a cookie so I think I think you know one of the questions I had is how do we bring non-science people to

**[00:36:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> recognize value in a cookie, cookie monster restoration once the cookies are over there or banned their monsters.

**[00:36:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do we bring people to see value and want to participate in, you know, participatory learning, you know, hands-on training and also maybe on ramping, you know, less formal and more ways for people to don't go to festivals.

**[00:36:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Don't ask, don't ask.

**[00:36:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'll shut up.

**[00:36:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anyways, that's a question and how could we get the word out to bring more people to some of this training and ecological societies trying to figure out how they can offer continuing education credit CEUs so that students can, you know, into this and see value in their career track.

**[00:37:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> can also see value with their you know with their college you know the degree the credits they get but there may be other ways to bring value that you know I'm not aware of that would bring other people to the table so that's my core question and what why are we stuck to you John.

**[00:37:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting well uh we will we will consider that question momentarily is there more you want to tell us about yourself or any of your specific projects um oh there's so many it's just simply not you know there's there's so much going on so um I can tell you we're the proud parents of the latest red wolf litter that has been born on the planet we a group of us bought 15,000 acres of dewatered ditched coastal north Carolina picosan wetland

**[00:38:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> restore it and now our project is delayed for until mid-June because we have one of the only red wolf litters on the planet that's taken up residency on our this property which is a really wonderful problem to have but you know nothing wrong with delaying the restoration of hydrology in this large acreage for a couple weeks so yeah yeah there's that and then uh we we got invited to albania to look at the coastal well a couple things um our illustrious president and his family walked into albania i don't think he had a direct hand uh and they they basically said we want to do a big resort here but the national park is in the way and they changed the boundary of a dedicated national park

**[00:39:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> give that family access to prime national park land.

**[00:39:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're doing a project with architect Jeanne Gang, Studio Gang in Chicago, a MacArthur fellow that's leveraging a different way to enforce a national reserve.

**[00:39:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're not going to call it a national park.

**[00:39:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So working on a project like that and just a whole bunch of projects.

**[00:39:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Northern Great Plains adaptive multi-pedal grazing study is finding out the same things that we published and you saw in the Soil Carbon Cowboys movie movies or videos.

**[00:39:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> A bunch of so many things.

**[00:39:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's just so exciting.

**[00:39:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Steve, as I understand it, Applied Ecological Services is now a part of RES, whatever that is.

**[00:39:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it still your base of operations or is this?

**[00:39:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> No.

**[00:40:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, I in 2021 I merged applied ecological services about just under 400 staff and 19 offices into REZ and I made a commitment to stand board for two years and after one year the the non-profit work was so exciting and overwhelmingly drawing me that I retired and set up the institute and where I now call home is we my wife and I and four others bought a country club and converted it into a place called the Three Waters Reserve and it's a public a public park that we restored hired the university was constant executive chef and he runs the food and beverage service and so my bit my my office is the basement

**[00:41:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> That used to be the pro shop in the golf course.

**[00:41:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's now a field station for training You know new we call it baby colleges that grow into adult ecologists and my wife Susan Lenhart and others are behind the educational programming and you know foisting that upon the world with wonderful interns that have amazing epiphanies by working in the field of restoration and Measurement and so forth So is this the Institute for Applied Ecology that you're talking about?

**[00:41:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, that it's the applied ecological Institute The Institute can you give us a URL?

**[00:41:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> I got it here.

**[00:41:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> E Institute org.

**[00:41:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah Yeah, I think the Institute for Applied Ecology is in Milbrook New York.

**[00:41:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, it's in Corvallis, Oregon Which is oh, that's right.

**[00:41:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's right.

**[00:41:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay

**[00:42:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, yeah, you know, we have a slogan in the era, we say, what can we all do together that we can't do individually, but and we'll pursue that question in a moment, but you seem to be doing it all individually, although I'm beginning to think that at this point, you've got an army behind you.

**[00:42:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not, it's not as big of a wonderful group of a family of, you know, staff and partners that I used to have.

**[00:42:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's greatly reduced and very focused on a couple of things, although it doesn't sound like it probably is based on what I just told you.

**[00:42:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's based on doing projects on the ground that inform stratifyx, which is the software app, and it's based on doing projects on the ground that that really serve as pilots and demos of take.

**[00:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> on the major challenges.

**[00:43:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's what we're doing.

**[00:43:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> And trying to nail the science and nail the communication and, you know, the art.

**[00:43:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> So Peter Bick, the film producer, working with us, we're working together on the grazing stuff and the on the climate food stuff.

**[00:43:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've got another whole team of communicators that are working on on that and regenerative ag.

**[00:43:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's so many wonderful people.

**[00:43:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not a it's not all under one.

**[00:43:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's it's a wonderful growing team.

**[00:43:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you asked a specific question, which is one that we've been thrashing about ever since we started, which is, how do we somehow get more and more people to understand, you know, that this is this is the most exciting thing about being alive in this particular universe, as far as we know, that

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The future is at stake, and for the coming generation, there's really nothing.

**[00:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's no better prescription for good life than to get on and say, I have the opportunity to save the future.

**[00:44:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But to do that, they have to understand that it's true and that they really can make a difference.

**[00:44:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so how do you get the word out?

**[00:44:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're doing education, I gather, at several different levels.

**[00:44:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I saw that Mike had a comment a bit a few minutes ago.

**[00:44:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Mike, do you want to introduce yourself since you came in a little bit late?

**[00:44:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then also start the discussion about how we can help amplify the kind of work that Steve is doing and that we're all trying to do.

**[00:44:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I apologize.

**[00:44:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> I wasn't following the chat.

**[00:44:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> was trying to...

**[00:44:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, that's okay.

**[00:44:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> If there's questions.

**[00:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys.

**[00:44:56] Mike Lynn**
> No worries.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> Thank you, John.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> I apologize, everybody, for coming in late.

**[00:45:00] Mike Lynn**
> But yeah, you had mentioned you had asked the question is there a way that we could get this in front of other people for continuing education As far as at the academic level, I'm not sure but I know there are institutions that offer Training such as the things like you mentioned Matter of fact, I'm doing one for an organization next month on living shorelines that The people that attend are typically engineers Landscape architects because they come to here for whether it's an hour long to our long full day long And then they get their professional accreditation continuing education hours.

**[00:45:34] Mike Lynn**
> So that might be one avenue.

**[00:45:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's helpful for you to pursue Yeah, we we've been doing that for years with with ASLA and with the the engineering You know groups as well and doing soil bioengineering and the whole range a lot of mine reclamation a lot of river My professor was lonely appalled and river physics and hydrology

**[00:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> been teaching that and but how do you there's so many opportunities how do you build a team around the opportunities and then divide and conquer is what I'm trying to figure out and I've learned a few things you know I thought it was holy as a scientist to get you know 300 people to review a paper and Peter Peter Big it's 600,000 website hits a month on the the the grazing videos now 17 million hits so far in in like 113 countries I can't believe it I mean why do we do science papers why do we write videos seem to be so incredibly you know good interesting yeah so um

**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just want to tag a few future conversations I'd like to have with you and what we shouldn't take at the time.

**[00:47:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have, as you may know, I now know I should send it to you, a project cooking in Panama, where we've said the watershed is a strategic global importance, and that the drought from recent years had such a huge financial impact that it's a really interesting laboratory and demonstration site for trying to show that you can fix climate by fixing ecosystems.

**[00:47:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we're just beginning to get some action on the ground.

**[00:47:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We imagine that when we do that, we're going to have to mobilize lots of people to come up with solutions that better their lives and improve, have measurable impact on local climate and perhaps regional climate.

**[00:47:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it sounds like your software and your expertise might really fit in very well there, so I'll follow up with you on that.

**[00:48:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've done several projects in South America and Costa Rica that have been watershed based restoration projects that we talk about and a bunch of a bunch in North America as well.

**[00:48:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right.

**[00:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The other thing I'll mention is my own answer to the question of how do we engage young people?

**[00:48:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben and I have talked about this a lot.

**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think every school and every university on the planet has got too much pavement, too much parking lots, too much grass, not enough native species.

**[00:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lots and lots of students who are desperate to do something meaningful about the future they're told is coming and probably alumni who would like to give money for a named Miyawaki Forest or another project of that sort.

**[00:48:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would become an outdoor living laboratory and create not just a patch of research.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> stored land, but a cohort of ecosystem restores who know what to do and can fan away from their schools and get it going.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Quaqui Wildcat, one of our ERA members, and I are talking about trying to get something along these lines going, but that recipe, whether it's Miyawaki Forest or some other school-based program, I think should be part of everybody's curriculum.

**[00:49:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I don't know quite a few schools over the years.

**[00:49:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> example, we talked about Seneca Falls a little while ago, John, right in your neighborhood.

**[00:49:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> To do the 1,000-acre Seneca Meadows restoration project around Seneca Falls there, we hired high school students and they collected with us native plant species seeds for prairie wetland savanna.

**[00:50:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a forest from about a about a 30 mile radius.

**[00:50:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then we paid students and we made flats, soil, and seeds available and instructions.

**[00:50:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> And they grew the plants.

**[00:50:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> then for that restoration, we bought plants back with one stipulation that they had to come back with somebody, a relative, a parent, a friend, and plant the plant materials with us.

**[00:50:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And we've done that.

**[00:50:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did that on several mining projects, the Flambeau Mine up in Lady Smith, Wisconsin, and the Jackson County Iron Mine in Black River Falls, starting in the in the mid 80s.

**[00:50:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> And now they're public parks now, these magnificent large landscapes.

**[00:50:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've created durable relationships through that mechanism with the with the community.

**[00:51:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these because now that the families come back to see the plants, they think they planted 20 years ago.

**[00:51:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really wonderful.

**[00:51:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interesting.

**[00:51:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And where are the stories told about these programs that we all agree should be replicated to tools all over the world?

**[00:51:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Seneca Falls story is told in the Audubon Nature Center there at the Seneca Meadows preserve right south of Rochester.

**[00:51:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the stories about Flambomine is told, you can go on the Rio Tinto website, they're so proud of it.

**[00:51:39] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Wisconsin DNR tells the story about those mining projects because instead of planting it with non-native or alfalfa, which is what was originally intended, we planted them with native vegetation, prairies and savanna vegetation, they're fantastic.

**[00:52:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> They just, who are just wildlife areas now, and recreation areas.

**[00:52:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I predict Ben Rubin and I are going to go to the Seneca, what's it called again?

**[00:52:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well it's, it's the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's right on the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> You guys are 45 minutes from there, or something like that.

**[00:52:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is pretty darn close.

**[00:52:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[00:52:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Steve, welcome.

**[00:52:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Steve, it's, it's, it's an amazing, it's work.

**[00:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see you're still going strong.

**[00:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we salute you.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> A couple.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> thank you.

**[00:52:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's an honor.

**[00:52:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, go for it, Natalie.

**[00:52:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, a couple thoughts.

**[00:52:46] Natalie Fleming**
> me, the big change to get, to get people engaged, when you focus on CO2, it's pretty depressing.

**[00:52:52] Natalie Fleming**
> But if, when you focus on the assistive restoration, you can really tie it to breaking the flood drought fire cycle.

**[00:53:01] Natalie Fleming**
> The CO2 focus, CO2 centrism is to me very depressing and slow moving, but eco-restoration is pretty dramatic and powerful.

**[00:53:14] Natalie Fleming**
> There's some fun things that we can do to teach people about climate and ecosystems and, I don't know, to me paragliding.

**[00:53:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I know this sounds crazy, but you talk about peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:25] Natalie Fleming**
> Paragliders, they fly.

**[00:53:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm a pilot.

**[00:53:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> Parasailers, parasailers, they fly and they don't wait for peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:36] Natalie Fleming**
> Right.

**[00:53:37] Natalie Fleming**
> They just get out there and do it and their life depends on understanding microclimates and how the landscape relates to the climate.

**[00:53:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And I do have a picture, I pulled up a slide on where I was down in Utah and they have a spot there, so I didn't actually fly, but they let me play with a kite for a little while.

**[00:53:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Not that crazy yet, but eventually I'll get there.

**[00:54:00] Natalie Fleming**
> I think that focusing on eco restoration over CO2 centrism in the water cycle, focus on the water cycle.

**[00:54:07] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a dramatic difference and it gets people excited because you can make a difference and you can make an immediate change.

**[00:54:13] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's, I think the CO2 is so depressing that people can't get past it and they don't feel like they can really do much about it.

**[00:54:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, we've learned that people are barren by trees because they can see it, see a tree and they don't understand soil carbon.

**[00:54:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's, you know, there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> And there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the soil carbon and all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we've been focusing on is peat and soil carbon projects first and forestry carbons less so.

**[00:54:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I'm a pilot and I'm what's incredible is how violent the winds and the turbulence are now.

**[00:55:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> compared to what they were over the years that I've been flying about 25 or 30 years.

**[00:55:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there are major changes that are occurring that I feel every time I get in the airplane, most every time.

**[00:55:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> So it's very, very frightening to think about flying under some of the conditions that now as a pilot where, you you take off in one place and the prediction isn't quite what it might be projected to be when you're trying to land somewhere.

**[00:55:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[00:55:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant, you have a comment and an observation.

**[00:55:39] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:55:41] sustainavistas**
> I think if we look at the process, mean, first it's not really trees or soil or carbon.

**[00:55:48] sustainavistas**
> I think we're generally talking about changing behavior.

**[00:55:54] sustainavistas**
> And something I'd like to point to, I think Joe has probably a time for us to maybe

**[00:56:00] sustainavistas**
> for me to jump on on and give an update, because we've, so see, we are the founder of my ecological founder of our group, Courtney of Balmeneu, which is more trees now in Dutch, started 14 years ago by himself for about the first five years, challenging the local council.

**[00:56:18] sustainavistas**
> So we just outside Amsterdam Schupper Airport in probably one of the densest population urban areas.

**[00:56:26] sustainavistas**
> And in the Netherlands it started with removing 1000 school tiles and putting, rescuing one tree from a local urban forest and planting that on a thousand schools plains.

**[00:56:39] sustainavistas**
> And that went on for five years and we've now 14 years grown into an organization that's saved, rescued and donated and transplanted in the Netherlands over three million free trees, siblings.

**[00:56:52] sustainavistas**
> 30,000 volunteers and we're now going to six countries, so Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland and France, which is

**[00:57:00] sustainavistas**
> last year started a kit of a project with five ecosystem registration communities of John D.

**[00:57:05] sustainavistas**
> Liu in Ireland, sort of Cree, in Vericelle, in France, Recoviva, in Italy, in Spain, we've just come back from Altiplana and also the EFC headquarters and then obviously we're in Dutch base, so we're spending two years developing training and education materials for that.

**[00:57:27] sustainavistas**
> But if you look at what we're doing, I really think we're probably the first organisation, there's one group in France and I'll correct me if I'm wrong in Australia or the USA or Canada or any other countries that they're doing it, but we basically use nature as a nursery and basically because we use 50 centimetre to two metre high trees, that's like our sweet spot, we can do bigger trees, but that's our sweet spot and these are five to 20-year-old settings, so we really

**[00:58:00] sustainavistas**
> starting with a far better base and then in the temperate north we actually rescue and save and our survival rate is 70 to 80 percent so and it's a free resource so we do about 150 species in the Netherlands and I think that so twice it's really mass participation of communities connecting people to nature and showing them an ecological solution as well as people can actually really scale so I mean this is probably one of the most incredible scalable solutions that's and and and so we would love people we if you look at our more trees now dot eco website we've got a whole communication toolkit we show our manuals our hands everything we've translated four languages but also we give it all away for nothing so have a look at that and I think it could be interesting to use that because if you can I mean we in the winter in our little area near airport skipway airport our biggest tree have we risked 140 000 trees and gave them away for free if we and that's any

**[00:59:00] sustainavistas**
> every day, every day for six months, 10, 20 year volunteers working on it, but if we got paid people, we got thousands of people to do this, and we could do it in 20 or 30 countries, we basically could really ramp up the carbon sequestration, but also change behavior, basically, and really.

**[00:59:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:59:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Grant, you have reminded me that it is indeed time for an update from you.

**[00:59:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll follow up for a report.

**[00:59:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you're right.

**[00:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You have a solution which has scaled and rallied tens of thousands of people.

**[00:59:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We really are in a planet with 8 billion.

**[00:59:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let's see how we can scale that up and then we spread the word.

**[00:59:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> think replicable models is really what we're all looking for in transferability to other systems.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yep.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Exactly.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you.

**[00:59:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you're in the Netherlands.

**[00:59:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> Did I hear that right?

**[00:59:56] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:57] sustainavistas**
> I'm actually looking...

**[01:00:00] sustainavistas**
> My son is, I'm actually in Canada, Quebec for a week, I'm actually looking at starting some trials up in Canada because I've just become a grandparent, so we'll be coming to Canada two or three times a year probably.

**[01:00:12] sustainavistas**
> So our first grandchild was just born in Montreal 19 days ago, so yeah, so I'm actually on a 20 hectare property, so I think this might be one of the first treehouses in Canada.

**[01:00:26] sustainavistas**
> So yeah, let's not take too much more time, but I think let's have a conversation in parallel.

**[01:00:37] sustainavistas**
> One other quick question to the group in order to join, do you know any members that are going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:47] sustainavistas**
> No, I do not.

**[01:00:48] sustainavistas**
> Okay, I'll put that in the email tomorrow, but if you can't follow that, it's probably often New York and London climate week is probably one of the highest profiles, about 40,000.

**[01:01:00] sustainavistas**
> And people go to Paris for three days and it's a really an epic event and a lot of submissions that got a lot of those solutions there and ecosystem restoration is a real big, okay, thanks guys.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thank you, Brett.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, great.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> It sounds like a way to think about transferability of the, you know, the, the.

**[01:01:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> How you change the behavior and less so what you're planning and unless that's critical, but to work across different ecosystems, that'd be great.

**[01:01:32] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, exactly.

**[01:01:33] sustainavistas**
> I mean, for example, one of the small projects, sorry, John, just we start, we kicked off this year, we did an eco fitness.

**[01:01:38] sustainavistas**
> So basically, not only working on the ecological fitness of the forest and the land, but we also work on the fitness and the health and mental fitness people at the same time.

**[01:01:47] sustainavistas**
> So we kick sort of that off this year.

**[01:01:49] sustainavistas**
> So there's some videos on that.

**[01:01:50] sustainavistas**
> That's why it was a bit of fun, but actually we have to pick it up.

**[01:01:53] sustainavistas**
> So we work from November to March for the trees at the moment.

**[01:01:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's basically our model.

**[01:01:57] sustainavistas**
> That's great.

**[01:01:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:01:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:02:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie, you just switched off your camera, but I'm hoping this is your moment to give us your presentation.

**[01:02:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, my friend just came out to see if I wanted some chicken that's a little bit too spicy for me.

**[01:02:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And to see if the kids in the dog can come out and play.

**[01:02:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, did you just say you wanted me to do the presentation now?

**[01:02:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I did.

**[01:02:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I did.

**[01:02:22] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, hopefully I don't start coughing like a crazy one.

**[01:02:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:02:27] Natalie Fleming**
> So, if you've followed me at all on LinkedIn, you know that I obsessed about the water cycle.

**[01:02:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think all problems I'll call every all the problems and ecosystems are caused by bare grounds and bare ground and lack of life.

**[01:02:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I blame everything on the desert and I blame everything on mineral dust just so you know just about.

**[01:02:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I had the opportunity to spend the winter in Salt Lake and it was pretty exciting for me to go back to Salt Lake.

**[01:02:58] Natalie Fleming**
> It is kind of the land of my children.

**[01:03:00] Natalie Fleming**
> sensitivity.

**[01:03:02] Natalie Fleming**
> When I started out in life, lived in the Utah Valley along the Wasatch Front.

**[01:03:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And if you've been paying attention, they have a terrible crisis now where they have the great drought.

**[01:03:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I first got down there in October, I was able to stay on Mount Olympus.

**[01:03:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Olympus looking over the valley and it was absolutely beautiful.

**[01:03:29] Natalie Fleming**
> This picture right here is from there.

**[01:03:32] Natalie Fleming**
> on the mountain side, it has a beautiful forest on the mountain side.

**[01:03:39] Natalie Fleming**
> If you're not familiar with the landscaping of the Great Salt Lake, you've got, as the winds come in from the west, you've got a lot of bare ground.

**[01:03:48] Natalie Fleming**
> You have the salt flats, you have the Great Salt Lake, and then you have these massive huge, I should have written down the exact height of the mountains and to Mount Tipinogus and all these Mount Olympus, they're huge.

**[01:04:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or gargantuan.

**[01:04:02] Natalie Fleming**
> And these mountains are amazing because they really trap in, they have the potential to trap in the moisture.

**[01:04:09] Natalie Fleming**
> But they have been denuding and ripping landscaping and plants out over the last 20 or 30 years.

**[01:04:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I was there 30 years ago, there were orchards and lawns and conifers and deciduous.

**[01:04:27] Natalie Fleming**
> There were all manner of life was there.

**[01:04:30] Natalie Fleming**
> And because the community is trapped between the mountain and the lake, there's very little room for growth.

**[01:04:38] Natalie Fleming**
> And so they've been denuding it.

**[01:04:41] Natalie Fleming**
> as strangely, the rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Thanks.

**[01:04:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I'm going to try this chicken in a minute.

**[01:04:49] Natalie Fleming**
> The rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:52] Natalie Fleming**
> so the solution was to denude the earth some more and rip out more trees and grasses and shrubs.

**[01:04:58] Natalie Fleming**
> And after a minute,

**[01:05:00] Natalie Fleming**
> official of the neighbors.

**[01:05:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, those are some domesticated teenagers.

**[01:05:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Just a second here.

**[01:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're not hearing much of your background.

**[01:05:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, I can hear it.

**[01:05:19] Natalie Fleming**
> I was screaming at him.

**[01:05:22] Natalie Fleming**
> It's a subdivision here.

**[01:05:24] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a full neighborhood going on.

**[01:05:26] Natalie Fleming**
> So they've been denuding the earth and ripping out landscaping and trees.

**[01:05:31] Natalie Fleming**
> The cities have been paying people to rip out vegetation in order to save the water.

**[01:05:40] Natalie Fleming**
> The Great Salt Lake strike team, and their plan to save the lake is to direct all water from the watershed directly to the lake and skip any vegetation in the landscape along the way.

**[01:05:55] Natalie Fleming**
> So I found out three hours ago I'd be doing this presentation.

**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So can I can I share?

**[01:06:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes please.

**[01:06:03] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay so um desktop one you're going to see all my stuff here all the kids um here is a video I wasn't able to export this video to the right format so uh this is the rocks that they are landscaping with now there used to be vegetation here and ripped it out in order to not use water their focus is is stopping water usage they don't understand the water cycle not used so they put in this rock landscaping and you can hear the highway this is the landscaping that they've put in and while I was driving around the valley I would stop and take pictures and videos as I went along and I was just horrified so you see these rocks we see the tree above ahead um this is a you know you're looking at a quarter mile of rocks and as I step into the trees you're going to see what they ripped out to save water

**[01:07:01] Natalie Fleming**
> And you're going to see, you know, six foot tall grasses, trees, shrubs, and a little small riparian area.

**[01:07:08] Natalie Fleming**
> I had the sound on, you would hear the birds chirping.

**[01:07:12] Natalie Fleming**
> And this whole area is next to the lake.

**[01:07:16] Natalie Fleming**
> It's between the lake and Jordan River.

**[01:07:18] Natalie Fleming**
> And they ripped down all this vegetation.

**[01:07:21] Natalie Fleming**
> And I have videos of the machines continuing to rip out more and more vegetation.

**[01:07:25] Natalie Fleming**
> There is very little of this left.

**[01:07:29] Natalie Fleming**
> So this is, of course, a month ago.

**[01:07:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So the spring hasn't come yet.

**[01:07:33] Natalie Fleming**
> I should probably go back in a month when it's all green.

**[01:07:38] Natalie Fleming**
> But they've just ripped this all out and the soil was rich and thick and soft and moist.

**[01:07:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And these are the tall pompous grass that they have.

**[01:07:47] Natalie Fleming**
> And they're ripping this out to save the water and to conserve water, because this is obviously using water.

**[01:07:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And they don't even understand that water is not used, water is cycled.

**[01:08:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, um, it's pretty horrific.

**[01:08:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, sorry, let's put that over here.

**[01:08:05] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Let's see.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> How are we going to go to slide show, uh, please start.

**[01:08:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:13] Natalie Fleming**
> So I threw this together real quick.

**[01:08:15] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, there's a picture.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> The great.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it is a shrunk exponentially.

**[01:08:21] Natalie Fleming**
> How do I go to the next?

**[01:08:23] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, I gotta move you guys over where I can't see you anymore.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> I think.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> Because you're, I can't say anything.

**[01:08:30] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, there we go.

**[01:08:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's in the 1980s.

**[01:08:33] Natalie Fleming**
> was about 3000 square miles.

**[01:08:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And now it's down to 150.

**[01:08:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's down to less than a third of what it was before.

**[01:08:40] Natalie Fleming**
> And as the lake shrinks, um, they've got some serious problems.

**[01:08:48] Natalie Fleming**
> One of the next to the lake, this is I, I am LDS and we build chapels everywhere and under advisement of the local community.

**[01:08:57] Natalie Fleming**
> They were advised to landscape in this manner.

**[01:09:00] Natalie Fleming**
> To use rocks and I compare using rocks as landscaping as using skulls and bones to landscape rocks are the are the skull.

**[01:09:08] Natalie Fleming**
> They're the structure of the earth and the soil and the trees.

**[01:09:12] Natalie Fleming**
> That is the flesh of the earth.

**[01:09:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So imagine just ripping the flesh off of your arm, which is grotesque and expecting the blood to flow and it's not flowing.

**[01:09:20] Natalie Fleming**
> So we know from Zach wise and water stories about Lancaster and all these wonderful people that you're supposed to sink slow and spread the water and then get as much vegetation as you can out of it to get the body pump going.

**[01:09:33] Natalie Fleming**
> And as you can see this particular structure, they've done the opposite.

**[01:09:38] Natalie Fleming**
> The tall this next right next to this was seven foot tall pompous grass that was ripped out and this is right.

**[01:09:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is Lakefront property.

**[01:09:46] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was water conservation gone wrong.

**[01:09:50] Natalie Fleming**
> If we do not have plants, you're not going to have rain.

**[01:09:54] Natalie Fleming**
> lot of people think the plants come because of the rain, but it's just like the chicken and the egg.

**[01:10:00] Natalie Fleming**
> to have vegetation and plants and great soil to keep the biotic pump going.

**[01:10:04] Natalie Fleming**
> I need to explain the bi...

**[01:10:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I can't let me put you back up there.

**[01:10:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I don't think you do actually.

**[01:10:09] Natalie Fleming**
> I do it.

**[01:10:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Everybody here gets it.

**[01:10:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[01:10:11] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:10:12] Natalie Fleming**
> can skip, so I don't have to explain the biotic pump.

**[01:10:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I can do that, but I think you guys are all versed in it.

**[01:10:19] Natalie Fleming**
> So the water cycle is completely biological in line out.

**[01:10:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And it's transpiration as an engine.

**[01:10:27] Natalie Fleming**
> so you all know about Pseudonose, Miserengi, and other mushroom spores and pollens that cloud seed at warm temperatures.

**[01:10:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So I don't need to explain that to you.

**[01:10:38] Natalie Fleming**
> So all of this, you already know?

**[01:10:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I think we are, we're here because we all share the same basic understanding.

**[01:10:48] Natalie Fleming**
> So here is the view from the place I was initially staying at.

**[01:10:51] Natalie Fleming**
> it's just beautiful, these mountains, and there's a great biodiversity of trees.

**[01:10:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And my plan for the Great Salt Lake would be to harvest all of the seeds,

**[01:11:00] Natalie Fleming**
> on this and set up nurseries and the mountains on the other side of the valley are barren.

**[01:11:06] Natalie Fleming**
> And so if we took the trees and expanded the forestry system, but they're cutting down trees, they're cutting down conifers because they all use water.

**[01:11:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it was very heartbreaking to see.

**[01:11:20] Natalie Fleming**
> the ancient Amazonians, they used the mountains to their advantage to trap in the as the clouds came in, as the moisture came in, they created water retention landscapes and built structures to really maximize vegetation and trap the water in.

**[01:11:35] Natalie Fleming**
> the Great Salt Lake in the Wasatch Front, that area has a great advantage with that great mountain that could trap in an incredible amount of water.

**[01:11:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is what I saw everywhere where by mandate the trees, the homes were built with rock landscaping, which to me is kind of like Terminator where they're walking on the skulls.

**[01:11:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the bones of the earth.

**[01:12:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Can you explain to you how and why?

**[01:12:02] Natalie Fleming**
> they're just directoring all vegetation over.

**[01:12:05] Natalie Fleming**
> then the lake has the lake bed because it does not drain anywhere else.

**[01:12:12] Natalie Fleming**
> It has a lot of arsenic lead in mercury and selenium that as it dries out, it's kicking that dust.

**[01:12:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And the ice nucleating temperatures of that dust, meaning its rainfall potential is very, very low.

**[01:12:25] Natalie Fleming**
> It has to be super, super, super cold in order for it to stimulate rainfall.

**[01:12:28] Natalie Fleming**
> So that's super bad.

**[01:12:32] Natalie Fleming**
> It was super depressing for me to see this because when I left, there were orchards and herds and all sorts of things.

**[01:12:38] Natalie Fleming**
> this unleashing pollutants, there's a health crisis because of the asthma and heart disease.

**[01:12:43] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got arsenic in the air.

**[01:12:46] Natalie Fleming**
> They've convinced a lot of local farmers to redirect water from the farm to the lake.

**[01:12:53] Natalie Fleming**
> And they think it's gonna help.

**[01:12:54] Natalie Fleming**
> So you already know what temperature, okay, don't need to give you that.

**[01:12:59] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:13:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, this is a view, a picture I took this winter when the snow was there and you can see that from the side of the mountain, you can see the clouds forming and rumbling on this side.

**[01:13:12] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on that.

**[01:13:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on any of this.

**[01:13:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So, on the right is a picture of what I, I took both these pictures.

**[01:13:22] Natalie Fleming**
> These were side by side.

**[01:13:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And on the right, this is along a riverbed, the Jordan River.

**[01:13:28] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping out massive amounts.

**[01:13:30] Natalie Fleming**
> I could show you the whole video of them piling up the dirt and shipping it off and then saying, we're having a drought.

**[01:13:36] Natalie Fleming**
> I just don't know why.

**[01:13:37] Natalie Fleming**
> if they, yeah, I don't know the polite way to tell them they're all stupid.

**[01:13:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> Natalie, did you see any good examples of landscaping that might be nothing at all?

**[01:13:53] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping everything out that they consider the rock landscaping is good.

**[01:13:57] Natalie Fleming**
> This right here.

**[01:13:58] Natalie Fleming**
> This isn't Saratoga Springs.

**[01:14:00] Natalie Fleming**
> If you look closely, those are logs.

**[01:14:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the only trees I found in that area when I was driving all of that particular area.

**[01:14:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the logs.

**[01:14:10] Natalie Fleming**
> They were building new subdivisions.

**[01:14:11] Natalie Fleming**
> They're building massive, massive subdivisions and they obviously they cut down some tree.

**[01:14:17] Natalie Fleming**
> But the focus is that that uses water.

**[01:14:20] Natalie Fleming**
> They're really obsessed with removing anything that uses water.

**[01:14:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Natalie, do you talk, do you give this presentation in Salt Lake City?

**[01:14:33] Natalie Fleming**
> No, I made this presentation an hour ago for tonight.

**[01:14:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you?

**[01:14:38] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact these people.

**[01:14:40] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email address.

**[01:14:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact Brian Stede.

**[01:14:43] Natalie Fleming**
> He is at the University of Utah.

**[01:14:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I got a really good reference person, really top notch person.

**[01:14:49] Natalie Fleming**
> He me the reference.

**[01:14:50] Natalie Fleming**
> He didn't really return the calls.

**[01:14:52] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email addresses of everybody on the right team.

**[01:14:55] Natalie Fleming**
> everybody, I don't know how to approach them without being a jerk, really, without telling them they're.

**[01:15:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Scrooming things up because who am I and they're hydrologists and geologists and all these.

**[01:15:05] Natalie Fleming**
> These are university hydrologists, but PhDs and post PhDs and teach at the university and who am I to go and tell them they're.

**[01:15:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> You know, the, the LDS church, we worked on the city creek.

**[01:15:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, the, uh, the mall, we were the folks that brought.

**[01:15:22] SteveApfelbaum**
> Uh, city creek to the surface that runs to the mall.

**[01:15:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the, the for profit arm.

**[01:15:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the foundation arm of the Mormon church.

**[01:15:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, very focused on the water desert ranch million acre ranch.

**[01:15:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're trying to figure out how to, you know, I wonder if the LDS angle rather than.

**[01:15:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Going to the city would be worth doing.

**[01:15:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> then the other angle is, um, we're working with the CEO of, uh, who bought big power mountain.

**[01:16:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's 20,000 acres.

**[01:16:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's really interested in setting a regional example of how to restore the water cycle.

**[01:16:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was really trying to get to eco of the ag reserves, which is the for business entity.

**[01:16:16] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was unable to break through and I am LDS and I've talked to my bishop.

**[01:16:22] Natalie Fleming**
> said, who do I talk to other than embarrass the church on LinkedIn, which I did.

**[01:16:27] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, maybe you can help me if you have the contacts.

**[01:16:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Send me an email and I'll see if the contacts are still viable.

**[01:16:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because we worked with them for six or seven years.

**[01:16:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I lived in Roosevelt, Utah and became very close with leaders in the church.

**[01:16:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because there's so many Jack Mormons and Roosevelt, they were afraid they were going to lose the tribe out there.

**[01:16:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So he even went after little Jewish boys like me to indoctrinate us.

**[01:17:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Just so you know, Jack Mormons are Mormons that don't quite abide.

**[01:17:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> No, I know that.

**[01:17:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I know that.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Oh, I know.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> I just saw everybody else listening.

**[01:17:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> I know what a Jack Mormon is.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> You're from the mountainside.

**[01:17:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So when I was there for the first month, I didn't understand why the lake was shrinking because I didn't actually go through the valley the first month.

**[01:17:20] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I've got some great shots.

**[01:17:21] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was good.

**[01:17:24] Natalie Fleming**
> The landowner actually wanted to clear something.

**[01:17:25] Natalie Fleming**
> So you can see a lot of bare ground that here with this forest, the mountain sides don't have many trees over there.

**[01:17:32] Natalie Fleming**
> And there were certain sides that had more trees.

**[01:17:35] Natalie Fleming**
> So these are the beautiful views that I got to see.

**[01:17:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I guess that's the end of that.

**[01:17:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> And those are big fire scars.

**[01:17:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those aren't from logging.

**[01:17:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those are wildfire scars from the early 20s and 1910.

**[01:17:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did the master plan for the open space system for Salt Lake City.

**[01:17:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's really interesting how fires played a big role.

**[01:17:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ranching and early fires.

**[01:18:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, if, if I'll send you my information, if you can help in there, there's several different, I could tell you all the stories of all the ways I tried to get in and try to reach the right people.

**[01:18:12] Natalie Fleming**
> But I do have the list of email address of everybody on the great Salt Lake strike team, but I have hesitated to email them because who is Natalie Fleming to go in and tell them.

**[01:18:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Natalie Fleming is now acquainted with Steve Applebaum, who it turns out has got roots in the area.

**[01:18:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if it is Natalie's diagnosis, roughly correct that they're doing almost exactly the wrong thing if they want to turn this around.

**[01:18:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're desertifying the area and not building capacity for water retention and for in the soil system and for lagging the runoff, the hydrograph.

**[01:18:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everything's running off the land so quickly.

**[01:18:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So yeah, it's the right, it's the right thing, but the church isn't easy to do.

**[01:19:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> to unless you get to the for-profit arm because they're paying for a lot of these problems.

**[01:19:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're, you know, the community suffering, the erosion and infrastructure damages are really significantly expensive.

**[01:19:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So I'm pretty distressed because at church they announced that they're going to do this great program to reduce vegetation on all the churches across the world and I want to go to them.

**[01:19:23] Natalie Fleming**
> I know they're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do this and I'm like who do I tell them that because Brigham Young taught us we're supposed to make the earth as a garden of Eden not Mars and that picture there of everything's going dark on me all of a sudden.

**[01:19:40] Natalie Fleming**
> That picture is, it looks like you're looking for the rover on it.

**[01:19:45] Natalie Fleming**
> It's so bad and I really want to sit down with them and say they're going to spend hundreds of millions possibly a billion dollars to do massive eco-destruction believing they're doing the right thing.

**[01:20:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We'll give Rob Lewis a chance to vent here.

**[01:20:03] Natalie Fleming**
> can see that his head is exploding.

**[01:20:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Go, Rob.

**[01:20:09] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Well, wow, what a great presentation.

**[01:20:12] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> thank you so much for what you're doing and a couple things.

**[01:20:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> One, in terms of who is Natalie Fleming, you may have to go to small groups of people and spread your story.

**[01:20:24] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And then Natalie Fleming will be someone with 100 angry citizens behind her.

**[01:20:28] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> That makes a big difference in whether city officials will listen.

**[01:20:33] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> the main thing I want to mention is when you mentioned the rains disappearing and as he described that situation, I was hearing me on over and over.

**[01:20:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Nicely, the situation he described.

**[01:20:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> He talked about the carrier component and the trigger component.

**[01:20:53] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And the carrier component is the moisture that comes in from a larger system.

**[01:20:58] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Mediterranean sea in the case of Mediterranean sea.

**[01:21:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> But it sounds like it's the sea in Salt Lake.

**[01:21:07] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> It's Salt Lake that's providing the moisture, and then you have the trigger, which is the vegetation.

**[01:21:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So they're reproducing the desertification, as Steve said, but in a particular way, very similar to what Mian was talking about.

**[01:21:26] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And, of course, it was always kind of assumed that he was referring to situations in Mediterranean climate, and they tended to be coastal situations, but this points to this happening in any kind of climate, and inland.

**[01:21:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So, yeah, my mind is kind of blowing up.

**[01:21:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> This is amazing what you're doing, and never doubt yourself.

**[01:21:54] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> I mean, who is Natalie Fleming?

**[01:21:56] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> She's this amazing woman who has figured all this stuff out.

**[01:22:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> and is just getting a start, start, yeah, please.

**[01:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I think he's right, Natalie, you mentioned today that you're thinking about politics, but I actually think that your best path to politics might well be to really say, this is who Natalie Fleming is on this topic.

**[01:22:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's only going to become more and more clear that you were right and that you had the courage to say it.

**[01:22:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it actually, I think, would give you a very distinctive brand as a politician if you led with that.

**[01:22:41] Natalie Fleming**
> And this form of environmentalism is agreeable to both sides, both the left and the right politically.

**[01:22:49] Natalie Fleming**
> But one exciting thing for me is if we can get the LDS church on board is that LDS church has properties all over the world and they have a missionary mindset and they have missionaries all over the world.

**[01:23:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, and the missionaries are required to put it in a certain number of hours of service in their community, wherever they are.

**[01:23:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And that is non, non, across the lighting service.

**[01:23:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:23:10] Natalie Fleming**
> And so, getting these youth, getting the youth trained before they go on emissions on this stuff.

**[01:23:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is one thing.

**[01:23:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:23:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The one thing we can do together that we can't do individually is to have Natalie compare notes with Steve and to Steve see if he can find a way in based on the fact that he.

**[01:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape that you're now reporting the destruction of.

**[01:23:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he has connections to some of the people whose interests.

**[01:23:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Maybe in preservation and restoration rather than in landscaping and tree cutting.

**[01:23:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can definitely try to help Natalie.

**[01:23:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> The, what I've learned is.

**[01:23:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Find the locations where it's working.

**[01:24:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> leverage and springboard off of those.

**[01:24:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> in some of the neighborhoods, unfortunately the more affluent neighborhoods in Salt Lake City on the on the school below the bench, there's people doing native landscaping and there's people doing graywater management.

**[01:24:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can point some of those out in the general area and if I was there I could take you to them.

**[01:24:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's some spectacular landscaping projects with native vegetation and you know pre-used down to the well-land vegetation and springs they've pre-aided.

**[01:24:39] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, what are my perspectives is the blasphemous to most people in the eco world and that is that when it comes to because I appreciate the water cycle I am pro-long, tall-long.

**[01:24:50] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:25:05] Natalie Fleming**
> But yeah, think stripping out the lawns is really detrimental to the water cycle.

**[01:25:10] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anything that doesn't have the reflectivity, the albedo and the heating capacity and the imperviousness that they're creating would be better and unfortunately lawn is better than what they're doing, but it's not much better.

**[01:25:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> But yeah, we could talk about that further.

**[01:25:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've written a couple of papers on the role of landscapes in water management that might be useful.

**[01:25:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Not on the Jordan River, but we've looked at the changes in river flow over about 100 years and increasing increasing amount of runoff and increasing low flows of increased

**[01:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> 400 times over historic low flows and the displaying the river in the Chicago region, median flows have increased if I recall about 250 times on average over historic flows and the high flow events are three to five times the historic high flow flood events.

**[01:26:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's in a paper we did with Leopold.

**[01:26:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we're doing is we've flip-flopped the hydrology at the watershed scale from a groundwater recharge and infiltration and very long lag time.

**[01:26:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> The lag is the time period between the center of the mass of the rainfall distribution, the center of the mass of the runoff distribution hydrograph.

**[01:26:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've converted recharge-based systems into surface runoff based systems and it's every urban watershed.

**[01:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's very few that that hasn't happened to, and virtually every agricultural watershed, the same thing has happened.

**[01:27:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the story is very well understood, but what's not understood in urban areas, at least in the West, in Salt Lake, a lot of the people there are new customers, and they're interested in high dollar houses with minimal landscaping.

**[01:27:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's part of what the Netflix owner at Big Powder Mountain wants to get across to the people moving into these 20 million dollar homes.

**[01:27:41] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, one of the things that set me is that the church in good faith has donated hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water to go from the farmland to skip the farmland and go direct to the lake.

**[01:27:57] Natalie Fleming**
> Which is

**[01:28:00] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:28:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, it's not going to work.

**[01:28:11] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got to keep everything flowing.

**[01:28:14] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, thank you.

**[01:28:15] Natalie Fleming**
> I would love to speak with you, Steve, if we can get some.

**[01:28:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, I'd be glad.

**[01:28:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some other really critical issues that nobody knows about there, except the FAA, the white pelicans that nest out on, I can't remember the island, Pelican Island is what we called it.

**[01:28:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now they're feeding at the mouth of the Jordan River and the marshes.

**[01:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> And every day, they're soaring right across the approach to the Salt Lake City airport.

**[01:28:44] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:29:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some big issues that because of the shrinking lake.

**[01:29:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:30:03] Mike Lynn**

> But Russ and Katie and Michael in particular, you will certainly have a number of things for us to put on our roster of look at all the wonderful things.

**[01:34:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Our network has done.

**[01:34:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can also send me an email, but if you do it this way, it'll save me some time, but I'm happy to go through it.

**[01:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:34:41] Ben Rubin**
> We're looking at your screen, Ben.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**
> Great.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**
> I'll just start at the bottom.

**[01:34:45] Ben Rubin**
> These are just some photos of programs last summer.

**[01:34:50] Ben Rubin**
> Getting some of kids out of the courtyard, coming from all over the world, the idea of just getting them interested in the four seasons that

**[01:35:00] Ben Rubin**
> we have here, including winter and April.

**[01:35:04] Ben Rubin**
> Doing different projects.

**[01:35:06] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see, this one is making bird feeders out of the milk cartons in the lunchroom.

**[01:35:13] Ben Rubin**
> We did planters, leaf tracing, different things.

**[01:35:21] Ben Rubin**
> I guess I'd be interested to share this small project.

**[01:35:27] Ben Rubin**
> It's looking at the courtyard space as it's been used and trying to figure out how to find opportunities to bring the students out during all the four seasons.

**[01:35:38] Ben Rubin**
> There is a cherry tree that fruits in the spring, and there's two fig bushes that fruit in the fall.

**[01:35:48] Ben Rubin**
> So it's nice to sort of have those as bookends.

**[01:35:50] Ben Rubin**
> just to give a small window into what's outside my window.

**[01:35:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the cherry tree.

**[01:35:59] Ben Rubin**
> One of the things.

**[01:36:00] Ben Rubin**
> is that is is a big focus for me.

**[01:36:02] Ben Rubin**
> I teach K through 12.

**[01:36:04] Ben Rubin**
> So, you know, my day is kind of this developmental bender of starting out with five year olds and ending with, you know, sometimes 21 year olds.

**[01:36:13] Ben Rubin**
> I've been looking at, let's see, I can share some of this.

**[01:36:17] Ben Rubin**
> I keep the sketchbook.

**[01:36:19] Ben Rubin**
> That's kind of my main artistic practice.

**[01:36:22] Ben Rubin**
> are some sketchbook notes that I've taken doing different educational programs here in upstate New York.

**[01:36:32] Ben Rubin**
> The students also, I think, really benefit from that practice.

**[01:36:38] Ben Rubin**
> So, we bind sketchbooks.

**[01:36:40] Ben Rubin**
> We use tetrapack containers, which are just recycled mill cartons, you know, K through 12.

**[01:36:46] Ben Rubin**
> The students are involved with, you know, binding these books and then learn, you know, practices for journaling.

**[01:36:56] Ben Rubin**
> I think what's really exciting is

**[01:37:00] Ben Rubin**
> look at how to take some of this stuff outside.

**[01:37:02] Ben Rubin**
> we've done a little bit of that.

**[01:37:04] Ben Rubin**
> Again, these are some of my sketchbooks, in terms of the classroom, you know, just sharing some different ideas that I've had using recycled materials and journaling to kids outside.

**[01:37:25] Ben Rubin**
> This is actually the Cornell webcam with birds.

**[01:37:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's something that we use often in the classroom.

**[01:37:36] Ben Rubin**
> You know, sort of rambling, but yeah, that's really it.

**[01:37:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> What Ben, what did the kids gravitate toward when you take them outside?

**[01:37:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Is there anything that they're really drawn to?

**[01:37:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> it activity like a bird that flies into the view?

**[01:37:55] Ben Rubin**
> What draws them?

**[01:37:57] Ben Rubin**
> You know, being able to take

**[01:38:00] Ben Rubin**
> things or trace things.

**[01:38:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, hands-on stuff, of course.

**[01:38:06] Ben Rubin**
> I feel like just being outside is, they're inside all day.

**[01:38:14] Ben Rubin**
> Public school is really just marching from one room to the other and sometimes just being able to get a sense of where the sun is in the sky and spending a half an hour outside makes a big difference.

**[01:38:29] Ben Rubin**
> It's this little wall up courtyard.

**[01:38:31] Ben Rubin**
> The school was built by Italian immigrants or it was started with an Italian community a long time ago.

**[01:38:40] Ben Rubin**
> So there's some of this stuff.

**[01:38:41] Ben Rubin**
> There's the figs and the cherries that are from previous generations that most of it is just weeds.

**[01:38:55] Natalie Fleming**
> What I find exciting about your work is

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think something inherent in all of us that about growing food, that that basic thing that we have power over gives you a sense of power for the rest of your life.

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**
> But there's also a sort of a project inspired by that book with these postcards of people from around the world writing messages to, you know, basically migrating peoples.

**[01:40:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned Ben, school is Rochester International Academy.

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is a sanctuary city, controversially this year, of course, and the population is very diverse and includes brand new immigrants, some of them from Afghanistan who incidentally Ben helped bring to Rochester.

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[01:52:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Send me an email or click the link.

**[01:52:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

```
**[00:20:08] Ben Rubin**
> Sure.

**[00:20:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm here in Rochester, New York, working in the public school system teaching visual arts the last three years, sort of jumping into the hot seat.

**[00:20:22] Ben Rubin**
> There was a big shortage after the pandemic, so it was kind of a career change opportunity, before that worked with John Scholl with the Enable Project, so the three Princeton prosthetics spent a number of years in Southeast Asia working on different projects related to education, I guess in terms of tonight, what I'm going to share is a plan for taking one of the unused outdoor spaces at the school where I teach.

**[00:21:00] Ben Rubin**
> and turning it into an outdoor classroom, basically a nature peace classroom.

**[00:21:06] Ben Rubin**
> There was a small grant that I got over the summer to do some training and get certified with some different strategies on that.

**[00:21:15] Ben Rubin**
> I figured I'd just share it's a small project, but I can share that and get some ideas from all of you.

**[00:21:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:21:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:21:29] indy singh**
> Of course.

**[00:21:30] indy singh**
> Hey guys.

**[00:21:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's up?

**[00:21:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How are you doing?

**[00:21:37] indy singh**
> Faze right now.

**[00:21:38] indy singh**
> How do I do this?

**[00:21:40] indy singh**
> Should I land first or should I keep the spaceship?

**[00:21:44] indy singh**
> What's up everybody?

**[00:21:46] indy singh**
> I hope you all are doing well.

**[00:21:48] indy singh**
> Thank you all for all the restoration work.

**[00:21:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indie, think you're going behind the moon right now.

**[00:21:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> You're breaking up.

**[00:22:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Alright, let's see.

**[00:22:01] indy singh**
> Let's see, let's see, let's see.

**[00:22:02] indy singh**
> Let's see if you guys can hear me now.

**[00:22:04] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, we got a flavor for Indy.

**[00:22:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:22:16] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> looks like everything was really high right now on my end.

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure?

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> bit more.

**[00:22:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can mention, Katie and Ben, that our ritual here at the ERA, which may change soon, is that ERA members become ERA members when they introduce themselves at a town hall meeting, which you have now done.

**[00:22:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a week later, assuming there are no objections, you've become full-fledged members with all the rights and responsibilities, too, which really basically just include checking in every so often, subscribing to our social media, findable through our website, and then

**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Passing on social media that resonate with you when you think would resonate with your network To other people in your network.

**[00:23:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It is also possible to Donate to the ERA.

**[00:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's a link on our website, and I am laboring mightily to try to get a Majority of our members to become recurring donors at whatever level they would like even a dollar a month because that It's a good thing and it actually tells us a little something about what we can count on All I'm going through routine issues here, I will mention that we do have our annual general meeting next month on May 14th, I believe and in preparation for that We're all Trying to assess what has happened since a year ago, and I am now putting into the chat a form Where Natalie

**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> mentioned that he just published a book, and Steve can mention that he just published a book, and Rob can mention that he just published another article, and we will try to bring all of that together in time from May 14th.

**[00:24:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, well, you will of course give our speakers your undivided attention.

**[00:24:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> I urge you to click the link.

**[00:24:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This form is basically untested, and see if you can put some information in it, and then I'll know if it works because I'm going be sending it to everybody in the ERA, all four to five hundred of us.

**[00:24:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:24:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First guest and speaker and soon-to-be ERA member is Steve Apfelbaum, a book of whose I have in my living room, and I started quite some time ago when I heard about him through Bio4Climate, and apparently the author of many books with more to come.

**[00:24:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Steve, give us your story, please.

**[00:24:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well, where do I start?

**[00:25:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, as a young child, nature was my passion, my bliss, uh, rehabilitating injured and raising baby animals was, uh, I did and was on a veterinary medicine tract to work with wild animals and, uh, and in vet school and a professor said, Hey, you love canoeing in wilderness.

**[00:25:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's a grant to do some research in a wilderness area.

**[00:25:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I said, Oh, wow, you mean like not having to take care of dogs and city cats?

**[00:25:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it turned out we got the grant and spent basically fast forward 40 years of staying the fire ecology of the boundary water, wilderness, and Quedicope Provincial Park couldn't be

**[00:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Northeastern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario and basically went on to graduate school as a result of that opportunity.

**[00:26:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> And my whole life has been focused on studying the healthiest ecosystems on the planet, measuring biodiversity, a whole range of functions, publishing technical articles, learning what we can from those systems and then emulating that and bringing that into design in urban systems and rural systems.

**[00:26:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So learning from caribou and bison and working with grazing systems, the soil carbon cowboy series that you may or may not have heard about, that's our work with Alan Williams and Gabe Brown.

**[00:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a whole bunch of people.

**[00:27:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now we've worked on about 100 million acres bringing improved grazing and provided the science and are continuing to expand on the climate mitigation opportunities and the biodiversity mitigation opportunities.

**[00:27:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That introduced me to the need for translating the science into market language.

**[00:27:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We put together in 2009 with Ratan Lal and a number of the top soil scientists on the planet, a carbon measurement protocol that became a global standard.

**[00:27:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Vera published it as VM0021.

**[00:27:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've subsequently converted that into a family of standards called the Regenerative Standard.

**[00:27:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> And last year alone, we have with project developers

**[00:28:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for about a million acres of improved grazing in North America and were on a track to hit 20 to 30 million acres in five or six years.

**[00:28:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> One of the things that we learned during the process of trying to work at landscape scales and get the science right and get the policy right and get the market right and get the trust and transparency right, was that there was no way to ecological literacy across any of those subjects.

**[00:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we spun out a company.

**[00:28:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> I retired from my company, Applied Ecological Services, about in 2021 and spun up a non-profit called Applied Ecological Institute.

**[00:28:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm Wisconsin based, Katie.

**[00:28:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're in southern Wisconsin.

**[00:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these heads.

**[00:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that organization has started a new company called Stratifix, which is a subscriber SaaS-based business that is basically bringing 200 or more datasets and mapping capabilities to any piece of land in the U.S.

**[00:29:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> currently and North America, less detailed.

**[00:29:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> But you can look at any piece of property.

**[00:29:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll immediately have the land ownership and all sorts of other amazing data, assessed value, value of improvements.

**[00:29:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then there's nearly 200 natural resource datasets that you can apply to that property.

**[00:29:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can do scenario planning for evaluating different land uses, whether it be restoration,

**[00:30:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for agricultural practices, adapt to multi-pedic grazing versus continuous conventional no-till versus whatever pillage.

**[00:30:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can evaluate different crops.

**[00:30:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you could do highest and best value optimization using actual real-time spot pricing for the commodities and all the NASS USDA data sets with the average soil yields and the economics for every county in the US.

**[00:30:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So that's spun up and that's really helping us do restoration at scale, including we used it to do about a billion and a half acre prioritization of all the grassland restoration opportunities in North America.

**[00:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's now being used by the voluntary carbon market by a number of players to go out and secure.

**[00:31:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or the landowner partnering relationships to do the improved grazing.

**[00:31:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a lot of that stuff that I've been working on.

**[00:31:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Education is kind of what brought me to contact you, John.

**[00:31:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> I've been teaching for about 12 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, co-teaching a class on the future of coastal ecosystems on the planet.

**[00:31:26] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then with COVID, I kind of retired from that job because it was no fun teaching over Zoom.

**[00:31:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, the personal relationships and the field work with the students is what really kind of made everything work well.

**[00:31:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> But there's an incredible unmet demand for bringing ecosystem restoration to not just the landowners that may have no technical training and what they want is, you know, how to

**[00:32:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do I do this?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do first?

**[00:32:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> What's it going to cost?

**[00:32:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> What are the downsides?

**[00:32:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, what are my decisions and how significant are they or can I grow into it lightly and kind of learn along the route?

**[00:32:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what I've proposed to the ecological society is a series of two-hour primers which I've already been teaching.

**[00:32:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> I did two of them in the past month with them and then a six or a 12-hour online class and then one week classes in the field in various places around the starting here in Wisconsin, southern Wisconsin.

**[00:32:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> we're doing huge coastal restorations in North Carolina right now.

**[00:32:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're doing huge projects, setting up a very large project in Alabama.

**[00:33:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've worked throughout the Americas, Central and South America.

**[00:33:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's all sorts of opportunities in different geographies to leverage those different geographies for training and really building a capacity to take restoration as a primary nature-based solution package to climate and water and biodiversity and food.

**[00:33:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> And, you know, also nutrition, all this to civilization, basically.

**[00:33:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> So I've been trying to work on that and what AEI is spending out our solutions and education around some of our biggest challenges.

**[00:33:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> Climate being one, biodiversity being another food, nutritional density and, you know, we can go on and on and on.

**[00:33:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a bunch of other things.

**[00:33:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We started a new food company.

**[00:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> me with the former chairman of Whole Foods, who was the chairman for 23 years, called the Client Food Company, that's focused on not just perennializing agriculture, but using long, long-used and traditional native foods that nobody pays attention to unless it's prepared right and then you ask, what the hell is this?

**[00:34:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're commercializing.

**[00:34:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We have FDA approval for human consumption of two native perigraphs, grains, and the nutritional value, this is a reference for genuine wild rye, almost for genitus, 23 to 28 percent digestible protein, incredibly well-balanced macro and micronutrient profiles, taste profiles, which I can't taste the difference, but the chefs that we've hired can

**[00:35:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> you know say things that I never quite understand but we're introducing that into a cookie line that may be at Whole Foods and we've just released a new cookie an old cookie that was the very famous cookie here in Madison Wisconsin called the gorilla cookie and soon we'll be introducing Virginia Wilder I flower into that cookie so Katie if you if you happen down into Madison gonna go to the Willy Street co-op and get gorilla cookies which was the anti-war protester cookie of choice in the 60s Vietnam War and now it's introduced the original recipe that was lost in time and nearly extinct never said that about a cookie so I think I think you know one of the questions I had is how do we bring non-science people to

**[00:36:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> recognize value in a cookie, cookie monster restoration once the cookies are over there or banned their monsters.

**[00:36:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do we bring people to see value and want to participate in, you know, participatory learning, you know, hands-on training and also maybe on ramping, you know, less formal and more ways for people to don't go to festivals.

**[00:36:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Don't ask, don't ask.

**[00:36:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'll shut up.

**[00:36:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anyways, that's a question and how could we get the word out to bring more people to some of this training and ecological societies trying to figure out how they can offer continuing education credit CEUs so that students can, you know, into this and see value in their career track.

**[00:37:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> can also see value with their you know with their college you know the degree the credits they get but there may be other ways to bring value that you know I'm not aware of that would bring other people to the table so that's my core question and what why are we stuck to you John.

**[00:37:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting well uh we will we will consider that question momentarily is there more you want to tell us about yourself or any of your specific projects um oh there's so many it's just simply not you know there's there's so much going on so um I can tell you we're the proud parents of the latest red wolf litter that has been born on the planet we a group of us bought 15,000 acres of dewatered ditched coastal north Carolina picosan wetland

**[00:38:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> restore it and now our project is delayed for until mid-June because we have one of the only red wolf litters on the planet that's taken up residency on our this property which is a really wonderful problem to have but you know nothing wrong with delaying the restoration of hydrology in this large acreage for a couple weeks so yeah yeah there's that and then uh we we got invited to albania to look at the coastal well a couple things um our illustrious president and his family walked into albania i don't think he had a direct hand uh and they they basically said we want to do a big resort here but the national park is in the way and they changed the boundary of a dedicated national park

**[00:39:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> give that family access to prime national park land.

**[00:39:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're doing a project with architect Jeanne Gang, Studio Gang in Chicago, a MacArthur fellow that's leveraging a different way to enforce a national reserve.

**[00:39:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're not going to call it a national park.

**[00:39:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So working on a project like that and just a whole bunch of projects.

**[00:39:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Northern Great Plains adaptive multi-pedal grazing study is finding out the same things that we published and you saw in the Soil Carbon Cowboys movie movies or videos.

**[00:39:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> A bunch of so many things.

**[00:39:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's just so exciting.

**[00:39:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Steve, as I understand it, Applied Ecological Services is now a part of RES, whatever that is.

**[00:39:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it still your base of operations or is this?

**[00:39:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> No.

**[00:40:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, I in 2021 I merged applied ecological services about just under 400 staff and 19 offices into REZ and I made a commitment to stand board for two years and after one year the the non-profit work was so exciting and overwhelmingly drawing me that I retired and set up the institute and where I now call home is we my wife and I and four others bought a country club and converted it into a place called the Three Waters Reserve and it's a public a public park that we restored hired the university was constant executive chef and he runs the food and beverage service and so my bit my my office is the basement

**[00:41:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> That used to be the pro shop in the golf course.

**[00:41:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's now a field station for training You know new we call it baby colleges that grow into adult ecologists and my wife Susan Lenhart and others are behind the educational programming and you know foisting that upon the world with wonderful interns that have amazing epiphanies by working in the field of restoration and Measurement and so forth So is this the Institute for Applied Ecology that you're talking about?

**[00:41:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, that it's the applied ecological Institute The Institute can you give us a URL?

**[00:41:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> I got it here.

**[00:41:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> E Institute org.

**[00:41:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah Yeah, I think the Institute for Applied Ecology is in Milbrook New York.

**[00:41:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, it's in Corvallis, Oregon Which is oh, that's right.

**[00:41:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's right.

**[00:41:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay

**[00:42:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, yeah, you know, we have a slogan in the era, we say, what can we all do together that we can't do individually, but and we'll pursue that question in a moment, but you seem to be doing it all individually, although I'm beginning to think that at this point, you've got an army behind you.

**[00:42:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not, it's not as big of a wonderful group of a family of, you know, staff and partners that I used to have.

**[00:42:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's greatly reduced and very focused on a couple of things, although it doesn't sound like it probably is based on what I just told you.

**[00:42:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's based on doing projects on the ground that inform stratifyx, which is the software app, and it's based on doing projects on the ground that that really serve as pilots and demos of take.

**[00:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> on the major challenges.

**[00:43:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's what we're doing.

**[00:43:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> And trying to nail the science and nail the communication and, you know, the art.

**[00:43:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> So Peter Bick, the film producer, working with us, we're working together on the grazing stuff and the on the climate food stuff.

**[00:43:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've got another whole team of communicators that are working on on that and regenerative ag.

**[00:43:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's so many wonderful people.

**[00:43:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not a it's not all under one.

**[00:43:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's it's a wonderful growing team.

**[00:43:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you asked a specific question, which is one that we've been thrashing about ever since we started, which is, how do we somehow get more and more people to understand, you know, that this is this is the most exciting thing about being alive in this particular universe, as far as we know, that

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The future is at stake, and for the coming generation, there's really nothing.

**[00:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's no better prescription for good life than to get on and say, I have the opportunity to save the future.

**[00:44:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But to do that, they have to understand that it's true and that they really can make a difference.

**[00:44:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so how do you get the word out?

**[00:44:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're doing education, I gather, at several different levels.

**[00:44:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I saw that Mike had a comment a bit a few minutes ago.

**[00:44:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Mike, do you want to introduce yourself since you came in a little bit late?

**[00:44:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then also start the discussion about how we can help amplify the kind of work that Steve is doing and that we're all trying to do.

**[00:44:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I apologize.

**[00:44:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> I wasn't following the chat.

**[00:44:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> was trying to...

**[00:44:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, that's okay.

**[00:44:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> If there's questions.

**[00:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys.

**[00:44:56] Mike Lynn**
> No worries.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> Thank you, John.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> I apologize, everybody, for coming in late.

**[00:45:00] Mike Lynn**
> But yeah, you had mentioned you had asked the question is there a way that we could get this in front of other people for continuing education As far as at the academic level, I'm not sure but I know there are institutions that offer Training such as the things like you mentioned Matter of fact, I'm doing one for an organization next month on living shorelines that The people that attend are typically engineers Landscape architects because they come to here for whether it's an hour long to our long full day long And then they get their professional accreditation continuing education hours.

**[00:45:34] Mike Lynn**
> So that might be one avenue.

**[00:45:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's helpful for you to pursue Yeah, we we've been doing that for years with with ASLA and with the the engineering You know groups as well and doing soil bioengineering and the whole range a lot of mine reclamation a lot of river My professor was lonely appalled and river physics and hydrology

**[00:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> been teaching that and but how do you there's so many opportunities how do you build a team around the opportunities and then divide and conquer is what I'm trying to figure out and I've learned a few things you know I thought it was holy as a scientist to get you know 300 people to review a paper and Peter Peter Big it's 600,000 website hits a month on the the the grazing videos now 17 million hits so far in in like 113 countries I can't believe it I mean why do we do science papers why do we write videos seem to be so incredibly you know good interesting yeah so um

**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just want to tag a few future conversations I'd like to have with you and what we shouldn't take at the time.

**[00:47:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have, as you may know, I now know I should send it to you, a project cooking in Panama, where we've said the watershed is a strategic global importance, and that the drought from recent years had such a huge financial impact that it's a really interesting laboratory and demonstration site for trying to show that you can fix climate by fixing ecosystems.

**[00:47:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we're just beginning to get some action on the ground.

**[00:47:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We imagine that when we do that, we're going to have to mobilize lots of people to come up with solutions that better their lives and improve, have measurable impact on local climate and perhaps regional climate.

**[00:47:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it sounds like your software and your expertise might really fit in very well there, so I'll follow up with you on that.

**[00:48:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've done several projects in South America and Costa Rica that have been watershed based restoration projects that we talk about and a bunch of a bunch in North America as well.

**[00:48:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right.

**[00:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The other thing I'll mention is my own answer to the question of how do we engage young people?

**[00:48:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben and I have talked about this a lot.

**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think every school and every university on the planet has got too much pavement, too much parking lots, too much grass, not enough native species.

**[00:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lots and lots of students who are desperate to do something meaningful about the future they're told is coming and probably alumni who would like to give money for a named Miyawaki Forest or another project of that sort.

**[00:48:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would become an outdoor living laboratory and create not just a patch of research.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> stored land, but a cohort of ecosystem restores who know what to do and can fan away from their schools and get it going.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Quaqui Wildcat, one of our ERA members, and I are talking about trying to get something along these lines going, but that recipe, whether it's Miyawaki Forest or some other school-based program, I think should be part of everybody's curriculum.

**[00:49:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I don't know quite a few schools over the years.

**[00:49:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> example, we talked about Seneca Falls a little while ago, John, right in your neighborhood.

**[00:49:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> To do the 1,000-acre Seneca Meadows restoration project around Seneca Falls there, we hired high school students and they collected with us native plant species seeds for prairie wetland savanna.

> And then we paid students and we made flats, soil, and seeds available and instructions.

**[00:50:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> And they grew the plants.

**[00:50:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> then for that restoration, we bought plants back with one stipulation that they had to come back with somebody, a relative, a parent, a friend, and plant the plant materials with us.

**[00:50:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And we've done that.

**[00:50:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did that on several mining projects, the Flambeau Mine up in Lady Smith, Wisconsin, and the Jackson County Iron Mine in Black River Falls, starting in the in the mid 80s.

**[00:50:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> And now they're public parks now, these magnificent large landscapes.

**[00:50:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've created durable relationships through that mechanism with the with the community.

**[00:51:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these because now that the families come back to see the plants, they think they planted 20 years ago.

**[00:51:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really wonderful.

**[00:51:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interesting.

**[00:51:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And where are the stories told about these programs that we all agree should be replicated to tools all over the world?

**[00:51:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Seneca Falls story is told in the Audubon Nature Center there at the Seneca Meadows preserve right south of Rochester.

**[00:51:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the stories about Flambomine is told, you can go on the Rio Tinto website, they're so proud of it.

**[00:51:39] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Wisconsin DNR tells the story about those mining projects because instead of planting it with non-native or alfalfa, which is what was originally intended, we planted them with native vegetation, prairies and savanna vegetation, they're fantastic.

**[00:52:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> They just, who are just wildlife areas now, and recreation areas.

**[00:52:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I predict Ben Rubin and I are going to go to the Seneca, what's it called again?

**[00:52:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well it's, it's the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's right on the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> You guys are 45 minutes from there, or something like that.

**[00:52:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is pretty darn close.

**[00:52:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[00:52:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Steve, welcome.

**[00:52:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Steve, it's, it's, it's an amazing, it's work.

**[00:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see you're still going strong.

**[00:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we salute you.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> A couple.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> thank you.

**[00:52:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's an honor.

**[00:52:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, go for it, Natalie.

**[00:52:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, a couple thoughts.

**[00:52:46] Natalie Fleming**
> me, the big change to get, to get people engaged, when you focus on CO2, it's pretty depressing.

**[00:52:52] Natalie Fleming**
> But if, when you focus on the assistive restoration, you can really tie it to breaking the flood drought fire cycle.

**[00:53:01] Natalie Fleming**
> The CO2 focus, CO2 centrism is to me very depressing and slow moving, but eco-restoration is pretty dramatic and powerful.

**[00:53:14] Natalie Fleming**
> There's some fun things that we can do to teach people about climate and ecosystems and, I don't know, to me paragliding.

**[00:53:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I know this sounds crazy, but you talk about peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:25] Natalie Fleming**
> Paragliders, they fly.

**[00:53:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm a pilot.

**[00:53:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> Parasailers, parasailers, they fly and they don't wait for peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:36] Natalie Fleming**
> Right.

**[00:53:37] Natalie Fleming**
> They just get out there and do it and their life depends on understanding microclimates and how the landscape relates to the climate.

**[00:53:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And I do have a picture, I pulled up a slide on where I was down in Utah and they have a spot there, so I didn't actually fly, but they let me play with a kite for a little while.

**[00:53:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Not that crazy yet, but eventually I'll get there.

**[00:54:00] Natalie Fleming**
> I think that focusing on eco restoration over CO2 centrism in the water cycle, focus on the water cycle.

**[00:54:07] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a dramatic difference and it gets people excited because you can make a difference and you can make an immediate change.

**[00:54:13] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's, I think the CO2 is so depressing that people can't get past it and they don't feel like they can really do much about it.

**[00:54:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, we've learned that people are barren by trees because they can see it, see a tree and they don't understand soil carbon.

**[00:54:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's, you know, there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> And there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the soil carbon and all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we've been focusing on is peat and soil carbon projects first and forestry carbons less so.

**[00:54:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I'm a pilot and I'm what's incredible is how violent the winds and the turbulence are now.

**[00:55:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> compared to what they were over the years that I've been flying about 25 or 30 years.

**[00:55:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there are major changes that are occurring that I feel every time I get in the airplane, most every time.

**[00:55:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> So it's very, very frightening to think about flying under some of the conditions that now as a pilot where, you you take off in one place and the prediction isn't quite what it might be projected to be when you're trying to land somewhere.

**[00:55:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[00:55:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant, you have a comment and an observation.

**[00:55:39] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:55:41] sustainavistas**
> I think if we look at the process, mean, first it's not really trees or soil or carbon.

**[00:55:48] sustainavistas**
> I think we're generally talking about changing behavior.

**[00:55:54] sustainavistas**
> And something I'd like to point to, I think Joe has probably a time for us to maybe

**[00:56:00] sustainavistas**
> for me to jump on on and give an update, because we've, so see, we are the founder of my ecological founder of our group, Courtney of Balmeneu, which is more trees now in Dutch, started 14 years ago by himself for about the first five years, challenging the local council.

**[00:56:18] sustainavistas**
> So we just outside Amsterdam Schupper Airport in probably one of the densest population urban areas.

**[00:56:26] sustainavistas**
> And in the Netherlands it started with removing 1000 school tiles and putting, rescuing one tree from a local urban forest and planting that on a thousand schools plains.

**[00:56:39] sustainavistas**
> And that went on for five years and we've now 14 years grown into an organization that's saved, rescued and donated and transplanted in the Netherlands over three million free trees, siblings.

**[00:56:52] sustainavistas**
> 30,000 volunteers and we're now going to six countries, so Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland and France, which is

**[00:57:00] sustainavistas**
> last year started a kit of a project with five ecosystem registration communities of John D.

**[00:57:05] sustainavistas**
> Liu in Ireland, sort of Cree, in Vericelle, in France, Recoviva, in Italy, in Spain, we've just come back from Altiplana and also the EFC headquarters and then obviously we're in Dutch base, so we're spending two years developing training and education materials for that.

**[00:57:27] sustainavistas**
> But if you look at what we're doing, I really think we're probably the first organisation, there's one group in France and I'll correct me if I'm wrong in Australia or the USA or Canada or any other countries that they're doing it, but we basically use nature as a nursery and basically because we use 50 centimetre to two metre high trees, that's like our sweet spot, we can do bigger trees, but that's our sweet spot and these are five to 20-year-old settings, so we really

**[00:58:00] sustainavistas**
> starting with a far better base and then in the temperate north we actually rescue and save and our survival rate is 70 to 80 percent so and it's a free resource so we do about 150 species in the Netherlands and I think that so twice it's really mass participation of communities connecting people to nature and showing them an ecological solution as well as people can actually really scale so I mean this is probably one of the most incredible scalable solutions that's and and and so we would love people we if you look at our more trees now dot eco website we've got a whole communication toolkit we show our manuals our hands everything we've translated four languages but also we give it all away for nothing so have a look at that and I think it could be interesting to use that because if you can I mean we in the winter in our little area near airport skipway airport our biggest tree have we risked 140 000 trees and gave them away for free if we and that's any

**[00:59:00] sustainavistas**
> every day, every day for six months, 10, 20 year volunteers working on it, but if we got paid people, we got thousands of people to do this, and we could do it in 20 or 30 countries, we basically could really ramp up the carbon sequestration, but also change behavior, basically, and really.

**[00:59:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:59:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Grant, you have reminded me that it is indeed time for an update from you.

**[00:59:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll follow up for a report.

**[00:59:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you're right.

**[00:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You have a solution which has scaled and rallied tens of thousands of people.

**[00:59:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We really are in a planet with 8 billion.

**[00:59:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let's see how we can scale that up and then we spread the word.

**[00:59:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> think replicable models is really what we're all looking for in transferability to other systems.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yep.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Exactly.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you.

**[00:59:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you're in the Netherlands.

**[00:59:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> Did I hear that right?

**[00:59:56] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:57] sustainavistas**
> I'm actually looking...

**[01:00:00] sustainavistas**
> My son is, I'm actually in Canada, Quebec for a week, I'm actually looking at starting some trials up in Canada because I've just become a grandparent, so we'll be coming to Canada two or three times a year probably.

**[01:00:12] sustainavistas**
> So our first grandchild was just born in Montreal 19 days ago, so yeah, so I'm actually on a 20 hectare property, so I think this might be one of the first treehouses in Canada.

**[01:00:26] sustainavistas**
> So yeah, let's not take too much more time, but I think let's have a conversation in parallel.

**[01:00:37] sustainavistas**
> One other quick question to the group in order to join, do you know any members that are going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:47] sustainavistas**
> No, I do not.

**[01:00:48] sustainavistas**
> Okay, I'll put that in the email tomorrow, but if you can't follow that, it's probably often New York and London climate week is probably one of the highest profiles, about 40,000.

**[01:01:00] sustainavistas**
> And people go to Paris for three days and it's a really an epic event and a lot of submissions that got a lot of those solutions there and ecosystem restoration is a real big, okay, thanks guys.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thank you, Brett.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, great.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> It sounds like a way to think about transferability of the, you know, the, the.

**[01:01:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> How you change the behavior and less so what you're planning and unless that's critical, but to work across different ecosystems, that'd be great.

**[01:01:32] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, exactly.

**[01:01:33] sustainavistas**
> I mean, for example, one of the small projects, sorry, John, just we start, we kicked off this year, we did an eco fitness.

**[01:01:38] sustainavistas**
> So basically, not only working on the ecological fitness of the forest and the land, but we also work on the fitness and the health and mental fitness people at the same time.

**[01:01:47] sustainavistas**
> So we kick sort of that off this year.

**[01:01:49] sustainavistas**
> So there's some videos on that.

**[01:01:50] sustainavistas**
> That's why it was a bit of fun, but actually we have to pick it up.

**[01:01:53] sustainavistas**
> So we work from November to March for the trees at the moment.

**[01:01:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's basically our model.

**[01:01:57] sustainavistas**
> That's great.

**[01:01:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:01:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:02:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie, you just switched off your camera, but I'm hoping this is your moment to give us your presentation.

**[01:02:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, my friend just came out to see if I wanted some chicken that's a little bit too spicy for me.

**[01:02:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And to see if the kids in the dog can come out and play.

**[01:02:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, did you just say you wanted me to do the presentation now?

**[01:02:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I did.

**[01:02:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I did.

**[01:02:22] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, hopefully I don't start coughing like a crazy one.

**[01:02:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:02:27] Natalie Fleming**
> So, if you've followed me at all on LinkedIn, you know that I obsessed about the water cycle.

**[01:02:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think all problems I'll call every all the problems and ecosystems are caused by bare grounds and bare ground and lack of life.

**[01:02:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I blame everything on the desert and I blame everything on mineral dust just so you know just about.

**[01:02:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I had the opportunity to spend the winter in Salt Lake and it was pretty exciting for me to go back to Salt Lake.

**[01:02:58] Natalie Fleming**
> It is kind of the land of my children.

**[01:03:00] Natalie Fleming**
> sensitivity.

**[01:03:02] Natalie Fleming**
> When I started out in life, lived in the Utah Valley along the Wasatch Front.

**[01:03:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And if you've been paying attention, they have a terrible crisis now where they have the great drought.

**[01:03:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I first got down there in October, I was able to stay on Mount Olympus.

**[01:03:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Olympus looking over the valley and it was absolutely beautiful.

**[01:03:29] Natalie Fleming**
> This picture right here is from there.

**[01:03:32] Natalie Fleming**
> on the mountain side, it has a beautiful forest on the mountain side.

**[01:03:39] Natalie Fleming**
> If you're not familiar with the landscaping of the Great Salt Lake, you've got, as the winds come in from the west, you've got a lot of bare ground.

**[01:03:48] Natalie Fleming**
> You have the salt flats, you have the Great Salt Lake, and then you have these massive huge, I should have written down the exact height of the mountains and to Mount Tipinogus and all these Mount Olympus, they're huge.

**[01:04:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or gargantuan.

**[01:04:02] Natalie Fleming**
> And these mountains are amazing because they really trap in, they have the potential to trap in the moisture.

**[01:04:09] Natalie Fleming**
> But they have been denuding and ripping landscaping and plants out over the last 20 or 30 years.

**[01:04:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I was there 30 years ago, there were orchards and lawns and conifers and deciduous.

**[01:04:27] Natalie Fleming**
> There were all manner of life was there.

**[01:04:30] Natalie Fleming**
> And because the community is trapped between the mountain and the lake, there's very little room for growth.

**[01:04:38] Natalie Fleming**
> And so they've been denuding it.

**[01:04:41] Natalie Fleming**
> as strangely, the rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Thanks.

**[01:04:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I'm going to try this chicken in a minute.

**[01:04:49] Natalie Fleming**
> The rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:52] Natalie Fleming**
> so the solution was to denude the earth some more and rip out more trees and grasses and shrubs.

**[01:04:58] Natalie Fleming**
> And after a minute,

**[01:05:00] Natalie Fleming**
> official of the neighbors.

**[01:05:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, those are some domesticated teenagers.

**[01:05:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Just a second here.

**[01:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're not hearing much of your background.

**[01:05:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, I can hear it.

**[01:05:19] Natalie Fleming**
> I was screaming at him.

**[01:05:22] Natalie Fleming**
> It's a subdivision here.

**[01:05:24] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a full neighborhood going on.

**[01:05:26] Natalie Fleming**
> So they've been denuding the earth and ripping out landscaping and trees.

**[01:05:31] Natalie Fleming**
> The cities have been paying people to rip out vegetation in order to save the water.

**[01:05:40] Natalie Fleming**
> The Great Salt Lake strike team, and their plan to save the lake is to direct all water from the watershed directly to the lake and skip any vegetation in the landscape along the way.

**[01:05:55] Natalie Fleming**
> So I found out three hours ago I'd be doing this presentation.

**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So can I can I share?

**[01:06:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes please.

**[01:06:03] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay so um desktop one you're going to see all my stuff here all the kids um here is a video I wasn't able to export this video to the right format so uh this is the rocks that they are landscaping with now there used to be vegetation here and ripped it out in order to not use water their focus is is stopping water usage they don't understand the water cycle not used so they put in this rock landscaping and you can hear the highway this is the landscaping that they've put in and while I was driving around the valley I would stop and take pictures and videos as I went along and I was just horrified so you see these rocks we see the tree above ahead um this is a you know you're looking at a quarter mile of rocks and as I step into the trees you're going to see what they ripped out to save water

**[01:07:01] Natalie Fleming**
> And you're going to see, you know, six foot tall grasses, trees, shrubs, and a little small riparian area.

**[01:07:08] Natalie Fleming**
> I had the sound on, you would hear the birds chirping.

**[01:07:12] Natalie Fleming**
> And this whole area is next to the lake.

**[01:07:16] Natalie Fleming**
> It's between the lake and Jordan River.

**[01:07:18] Natalie Fleming**
> And they ripped down all this vegetation.

**[01:07:21] Natalie Fleming**
> And I have videos of the machines continuing to rip out more and more vegetation.

**[01:07:25] Natalie Fleming**
> There is very little of this left.

**[01:07:29] Natalie Fleming**
> So this is, of course, a month ago.

**[01:07:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So the spring hasn't come yet.

**[01:07:33] Natalie Fleming**
> I should probably go back in a month when it's all green.

**[01:07:38] Natalie Fleming**
> But they've just ripped this all out and the soil was rich and thick and soft and moist.

**[01:07:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And these are the tall pompous grass that they have.

**[01:07:47] Natalie Fleming**
> And they're ripping this out to save the water and to conserve water, because this is obviously using water.

**[01:07:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And they don't even understand that water is not used, water is cycled.

**[01:08:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, um, it's pretty horrific.

**[01:08:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, sorry, let's put that over here.

**[01:08:05] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Let's see.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> How are we going to go to slide show, uh, please start.

**[01:08:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:13] Natalie Fleming**
> So I threw this together real quick.

**[01:08:15] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, there's a picture.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> The great.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it is a shrunk exponentially.

**[01:08:21] Natalie Fleming**
> How do I go to the next?

**[01:08:23] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, I gotta move you guys over where I can't see you anymore.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> I think.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> Because you're, I can't say anything.

**[01:08:30] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, there we go.

**[01:08:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's in the 1980s.

**[01:08:33] Natalie Fleming**
> was about 3000 square miles.

**[01:08:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And now it's down to 150.

**[01:08:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's down to less than a third of what it was before.

**[01:08:40] Natalie Fleming**
> And as the lake shrinks, um, they've got some serious problems.

**[01:08:48] Natalie Fleming**
> One of the next to the lake, this is I, I am LDS and we build chapels everywhere and under advisement of the local community.

**[01:08:57] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:09:12] Natalie Fleming**
> That is the flesh of the earth.

**[01:09:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So imagine just ripping the flesh off of your arm, which is grotesque and expecting the blood to flow and it's not flowing.

**[01:09:20] Natalie Fleming**
> So we know from Zach wise and water stories about Lancaster and all these wonderful people that you're supposed to sink slow and spread the water and then get as much vegetation as you can out of it to get the body pump going.

**[01:09:33] Natalie Fleming**
> And as you can see this particular structure, they've done the opposite.

**[01:09:38] Natalie Fleming**
> The tall this next right next to this was seven foot tall pompous grass that was ripped out and this is right.

**[01:09:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is Lakefront property.

**[01:09:46] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:10:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I don't think you do actually.

**[01:10:09] Natalie Fleming**
> I do it.

**[01:10:10] Natalie Fleming**

> Okay.

**[01:10:11] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:10:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I can do that, but I think you guys are all versed in it.

**[01:10:19] Natalie Fleming**
> So the water cycle is completely biological in line out.

**[01:10:24] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:10:27] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:10:36] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:10:38] Natalie Fleming**
> So all of this, you already know?

**[01:10:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I think we are, we're here because we all share the same basic understanding.

**[01:10:48] Natalie Fleming**
> So here is the view from the place I was initially staying at.

**[01:10:51] Natalie Fleming**
> it's just beautiful, these mountains, and there's a great biodiversity of trees.

**[01:10:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And my plan for the Great Salt Lake would be to harvest all of the seeds,

**[01:11:00] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:11:06] Natalie Fleming**
> And so if we took the trees and expanded the forestry system, but they're cutting down trees, they're cutting down conifers because they all use water.

**[01:11:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it was very heartbreaking to see.

**[01:11:20] Natalie Fleming**
> the ancient Amazonians, they used the mountains to their advantage to trap in the as the clouds came in, as the moisture came in, they created water retention landscapes and built structures to really maximize vegetation and trap the water in.

**[01:11:35] Natalie Fleming**
> the Great Salt Lake in the Wasatch Front, that area has a great advantage with that great mountain that could trap in an incredible amount of water.

**[01:11:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is what I saw everywhere where by mandate the trees, the homes were built with rock landscaping, which to me is kind of like Terminator where they're walking on the skulls.

**[01:11:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the bones of the earth.

**[01:12:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Can you explain to you how and why?

**[01:12:02] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:12:05] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:12:12] Natalie Fleming**
> It has a lot of arsenic lead in mercury and selenium that as it dries out, it's kicking that dust.

**[01:12:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And the ice nucleating temperatures of that dust, meaning its rainfall potential is very, very low.

**[01:12:25] Natalie Fleming**
> It has to be super, super, super cold in order for it to stimulate rainfall.

**[01:12:28] Natalie Fleming**
> So that's super bad.

**[01:12:32] Natalie Fleming**
> It was super depressing for me to see this because when I left, there were orchards and herds and all sorts of things.

**[01:12:38] Natalie Fleming**
> this unleashing pollutants, there's a health crisis because of the asthma and heart disease.

**[01:12:43] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got arsenic in the air.

**[01:12:46] Natalie Fleming**
> They've convinced a lot of local farmers to redirect water from the farm to the lake.

**[01:12:53] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:12:54] Natalie Fleming**
> So you already know what temperature, okay, don't need to give you that.

**[01:12:59] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:13:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, this is a view, a picture I took this winter when the snow was there and you can see that from the side of the mountain, you can see the clouds forming and rumbling on this side.

**[01:13:12] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:13:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on any of this.

**[01:13:17] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:13:22] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:13:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And on the right, this is along a riverbed, the Jordan River.

**[01:13:28] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:13:30] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:13:53] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping everything out that they consider the rock landscaping is good.

**[01:13:57] Natalie Fleming**
> This right here.

**[01:13:58] Natalie Fleming**
> This isn't Saratoga Springs.

**[01:14:00] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:14:02] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:14:11] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:14:33] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:14:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:14:38] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact these people.

**[01:14:40] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:14:49] Natalie Fleming**
> He me the reference.

**[01:14:50] Natalie Fleming**
> He didn't really return the calls.

**[01:14:52] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email addresses of everybody on the right team.

**[01:14:55] Natalie Fleming**
> everybody, I don't know how to approach them without being a jerk, really, without telling them they're.

**[01:15:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Scrooming things up because who am I and they're hydrologists and geologists and all these.

**[01:15:05] Natalie Fleming**
> These are university hydrologists, but PhDs and post PhDs and teach at the university and who am I to go and tell them they're.

**[01:15:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> You know, the, the LDS church, we worked on the city creek.

**[01:15:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, the, uh, the mall, we were the folks that brought.

**[01:15:22] SteveApfelbaum**
> Uh, city creek to the surface that runs to the mall.

**[01:15:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the, the for profit arm.

**[01:15:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the foundation arm of the Mormon church.

**[01:15:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, very focused on the water desert ranch million acre ranch.

**[01:15:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're trying to figure out how to, you know, I wonder if the LDS angle rather than.

**[01:15:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Going to the city would be worth doing.

**[01:15:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> then the other angle is, um, we're working with the CEO of, uh, who bought big power mountain.

**[01:16:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's 20,000 acres.

**[01:16:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's really interested in setting a regional example of how to restore the water cycle.

**[01:16:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was really trying to get to eco of the ag reserves, which is the for business entity.

**[01:16:16] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was unable to break through and I am LDS and I've talked to my bishop.

**[01:16:22] Natalie Fleming**
> said, who do I talk to other than embarrass the church on LinkedIn, which I did.

**[01:16:27] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, maybe you can help me if you have the contacts.

**[01:16:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Send me an email and I'll see if the contacts are still viable.

**[01:16:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because we worked with them for six or seven years.

**[01:16:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I lived in Roosevelt, Utah and became very close with leaders in the church.

**[01:16:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because there's so many Jack Mormons and Roosevelt, they were afraid they were going to lose the tribe out there.

**[01:16:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So he even went after little Jewish boys like me to indoctrinate us.

**[01:17:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Just so you know, Jack Mormons are Mormons that don't quite abide.

**[01:17:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> No, I know that.

**[01:17:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I know that.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Oh, I know.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> I just saw everybody else listening.

**[01:17:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> I know what a Jack Mormon is.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> You're from the mountainside.

**[01:17:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So when I was there for the first month, I didn't understand why the lake was shrinking because I didn't actually go through the valley the first month.

**[01:17:20] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I've got some great shots.

**[01:17:21] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was good.

**[01:17:24] Natalie Fleming**
> The landowner actually wanted to clear something.

**[01:17:25] Natalie Fleming**
> So you can see a lot of bare ground that here with this forest, the mountain sides don't have many trees over there.

**[01:17:32] Natalie Fleming**
> And there were certain sides that had more trees.

**[01:17:35] Natalie Fleming**
> So these are the beautiful views that I got to see.

**[01:17:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I guess that's the end of that.

**[01:17:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> And those are big fire scars.

**[01:17:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those aren't from logging.

**[01:17:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those are wildfire scars from the early 20s and 1910.

**[01:17:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did the master plan for the open space system for Salt Lake City.

**[01:17:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's really interesting how fires played a big role.

**[01:17:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ranching and early fires.

**[01:18:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, if, if I'll send you my information, if you can help in there, there's several different, I could tell you all the stories of all the ways I tried to get in and try to reach the right people.

**[01:18:12] Natalie Fleming**
> But I do have the list of email address of everybody on the great Salt Lake strike team, but I have hesitated to email them because who is Natalie Fleming to go in and tell them.

**[01:18:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Natalie Fleming is now acquainted with Steve Applebaum, who it turns out has got roots in the area.

**[01:18:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if it is Natalie's diagnosis, roughly correct that they're doing almost exactly the wrong thing if they want to turn this around.

**[01:18:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're desertifying the area and not building capacity for water retention and for in the soil system and for lagging the runoff, the hydrograph.

**[01:18:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everything's running off the land so quickly.

**[01:18:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So yeah, it's the right, it's the right thing, but the church isn't easy to do.

**[01:19:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> to unless you get to the for-profit arm because they're paying for a lot of these problems.

**[01:19:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're, you know, the community suffering, the erosion and infrastructure damages are really significantly expensive.

**[01:19:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So I'm pretty distressed because at church they announced that they're going to do this great program to reduce vegetation on all the churches across the world and I want to go to them.

**[01:19:23] Natalie Fleming**
> I know they're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do this and I'm like who do I tell them that because Brigham Young taught us we're supposed to make the earth as a garden of Eden not Mars and that picture there of everything's going dark on me all of a sudden.

**[01:19:40] Natalie Fleming**
> That picture is, it looks like you're looking for the rover on it.

**[01:19:45] Natalie Fleming**
> It's so bad and I really want to sit down with them and say they're going to spend hundreds of millions possibly a billion dollars to do massive eco-destruction believing they're doing the right thing.

**[01:20:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Go, Rob.

**[01:20:09] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Well, wow, what a great presentation.

**[01:20:12] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> thank you so much for what you're doing and a couple things.

**[01:20:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> One, in terms of who is Natalie Fleming, you may have to go to small groups of people and spread your story.

**[01:20:24] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And then Natalie Fleming will be someone with 100 angry citizens behind her.

**[01:20:28] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> That makes a big difference in whether city officials will listen.

**[01:20:33] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> the main thing I want to mention is when you mentioned the rains disappearing and as he described that situation, I was hearing me on over and over.

**[01:20:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Nicely, the situation he described.

**[01:20:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> He talked about the carrier component and the trigger component.

**[01:20:53] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And the carrier component is the moisture that comes in from a larger system.

**[01:20:58] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Mediterranean sea in the case of Mediterranean sea.

**[01:21:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> But it sounds like it's the sea in Salt Lake.

**[01:21:07] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> It's Salt Lake that's providing the moisture, and then you have the trigger, which is the vegetation.

**[01:21:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So they're reproducing the desertification, as Steve said, but in a particular way, very similar to what Mian was talking about.

**[01:21:26] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And, of course, it was always kind of assumed that he was referring to situations in Mediterranean climate, and they tended to be coastal situations, but this points to this happening in any kind of climate, and inland.

**[01:21:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So, yeah, my mind is kind of blowing up.

**[01:21:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> This is amazing what you're doing, and never doubt yourself.

**[01:21:54] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> I mean, who is Natalie Fleming?

**[01:21:56] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> She's this amazing woman who has figured all this stuff out.

**[01:22:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**

**[01:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I think he's right, Natalie, you mentioned today that you're thinking about politics, but I actually think that your best path to politics might well be to really say, this is who Natalie Fleming is on this topic.

**[01:22:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's only going to become more and more clear that you were right and that you had the courage to say it.

**[01:22:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it actually, I think, would give you a very distinctive brand as a politician if you led with that.

**[01:22:41] Natalie Fleming**
> And this form of environmentalism is agreeable to both sides, both the left and the right politically.

**[01:22:49] Natalie Fleming**
> But one exciting thing for me is if we can get the LDS church on board is that LDS church has properties all over the world and they have a missionary mindset and they have missionaries all over the world.

**[01:23:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, and the missionaries are required to put it in a certain number of hours of service in their community, wherever they are.

**[01:23:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And that is non, non, across the lighting service.

**[01:23:09] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:23:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:23:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:23:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> That's in a paper we did with Leopold.

**[01:26:24] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:26:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> The lag is the time period between the center of the mass of the rainfall distribution, the center of the mass of the runoff distribution hydrograph.

**[01:26:48] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's very few that that hasn't happened to, and virtually every agricultural watershed, the same thing has happened.

**[01:27:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the story is very well understood, but what's not understood in urban areas, at least in the West, in Salt Lake, a lot of the people there are new customers, and they're interested in high dollar houses with minimal landscaping.

> So there's some other really critical issues that nobody knows about there, except the FAA, the white pelicans that nest out on, I can't remember the island, Pelican Island is what we called it.

**[01:28:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now they're feeding at the mouth of the Jordan River and the marshes.

**[01:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> And every day, they're soaring right across the approach to the Salt Lake City airport.

**[01:28:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I can guarantee it, there's going to be a mid-afternoon collision between a Delta airline airplane and a 14-pound bird with an 84-inch wingspan.

> it'll knock a jet out.

**[01:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> so the wildlife hazard issue is real, real, because the lake is receded in the Jordan River is, you know, the only primary freshwater source other than up at Bear, you know, the Bear River refuge to the northeast.

**[01:29:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some big issues that because of the shrinking lake.

**[01:29:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, three months from now, I would like to hear a re-presentation by Natalie and Steve about the plan to reform Salt Lake and what comes of it.

**[01:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I want to let Mike ask the last, make the last comment on this topic and then I want to give and Ruben a chance.

> You're on mute.

**[01:29:47] Mike Lynn**
> Yes, thank you.

**[01:29:48] Mike Lynn**
> Natalie, you mentioned about the challenge of going into somebody when you they have the you have the opinion that they have their science that is backing them up.

**[01:29:56] Mike Lynn**
> There's a significant body of literature in the scientific space.

**[01:30:00] Mike Lynn**
> peer-reviewed literature that says the exact opposite.

**[01:30:03] Mike Lynn**
> So I think going in armed with that, if you foresee, if you anticipate them throwing out whatever things there are, there is a significant body of peer-reviewed literature that says what they're doing is not the way to do it.

**[01:30:18] Mike Lynn**
> That's all I have.

**[01:30:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Thank you.

**[01:30:19] Natalie Fleming**
> Thank you.

**[01:30:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> For that matter, I think, Natalie, you should find a speaking gig for Steve Attenborough to talk about Salt Lake City.

**[01:30:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Then, and 10 years from now, and use him as a lever.

**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's nuts.

**[01:30:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> OK.

**[01:30:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Mike, thank you for pointing that out.

**[01:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:32:12] Ben Rubin**
> You know, the curriculum that I bring in, there's a courtyard right next to the classroom.

**[01:32:20] Ben Rubin**
> So I've got a little presentation.

**[01:32:22] Ben Rubin**
> You know, my, my project is literally looking at a very small space in the.

**[01:32:27] Ben Rubin**
> You know, 150 year old school building.

**[01:32:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's pretty small scale, the idea of.

**[01:32:37] Ben Rubin**
> Looking at education and how to transfer some of these larger issues and world challenges into the interest of young students.

**[01:32:52] Ben Rubin**
> I'm seeing if I can share my screen.

**[01:32:57] Ben Rubin**

**[01:33:00] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see if this is a hold on a moment.

**[01:33:04] Ben Rubin**
> Okay.

**[01:33:07] Ben Rubin**
> Nope.

**[01:33:09] Ben Rubin**
> Not this one.

**[01:33:10] Ben Rubin**
> Let me see if I can transfer the link over one second.

**[01:33:13] Ben Rubin**
> Apologies.

**[01:33:20] Ben Rubin**
> Do a little bit of digging.

**[01:33:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got the Seneca meadows wetland preserve.

**[01:33:26] Ben Rubin**

**[01:33:27] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah.

**[01:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's snowed this morning here in Rochester, but as soon as the weather gets, as it ought to be, I'm eager to go to Seneca meadows.

**[01:33:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It sounds like it'd be a nice, nice trip.

**[01:33:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben, I do see the, well, I'm just going to bring it over from another window.

**[01:33:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's a cool bird, birding hot spot, John.

**[01:33:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's like the only place you can reliably see American bitterns and clapper rails.

**[01:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really a pretty damn cool place.

**[01:34:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[01:34:07] Ben Rubin**
> Sorry.

**[01:34:10] Ben Rubin**

**[01:34:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:34:41] Ben Rubin**
> We're looking at your screen, Ben.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**
> Great.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**

> Getting some of kids out of the courtyard, coming from all over the world, the idea of just getting them interested in the four seasons that

**[01:35:04] Ben Rubin**
> Doing different projects.

**[01:35:06] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see, this one is making bird feeders out of the milk cartons in the lunchroom.

**[01:35:13] Ben Rubin**
> We did planters, leaf tracing, different things.

**[01:35:21] Ben Rubin**
> I guess I'd be interested to share this small project.

**[01:35:27] Ben Rubin**
> It's looking at the courtyard space as it's been used and trying to figure out how to find opportunities to bring the students out during all the four seasons.

**[01:35:38] Ben Rubin**
> There is a cherry tree that fruits in the spring, and there's two fig bushes that fruit in the fall.

**[01:35:48] Ben Rubin**
> So it's nice to sort of have those as bookends.

**[01:35:50] Ben Rubin**
> just to give a small window into what's outside my window.

**[01:35:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the cherry tree.

**[01:35:59] Ben Rubin**
> One of the things.

**[01:36:00] Ben Rubin**

**[01:36:02] Ben Rubin**
> I teach K through 12.

**[01:36:04] Ben Rubin**
> So, you know, my day is kind of this developmental bender of starting out with five year olds and ending with, you know, sometimes 21 year olds.

**[01:36:13] Ben Rubin**
> I've been looking at, let's see, I can share some of this.

**[01:36:17] Ben Rubin**
> I keep the sketchbook.

**[01:36:19] Ben Rubin**
> That's kind of my main artistic practice.

**[01:36:22] Ben Rubin**
> are some sketchbook notes that I've taken doing different educational programs here in upstate New York.

**[01:36:32] Ben Rubin**
> The students also, I think, really benefit from that practice.

**[01:36:38] Ben Rubin**
> So, we bind sketchbooks.

**[01:36:40] Ben Rubin**
> We use tetrapack containers, which are just recycled mill cartons, you know, K through 12.

**[01:36:46] Ben Rubin**
> The students are involved with, you know, binding these books and then learn, you know, practices for journaling.

**[01:36:56] Ben Rubin**
> I think what's really exciting is

**[01:37:00] Ben Rubin**
> look at how to take some of this stuff outside.

**[01:37:02] Ben Rubin**
> we've done a little bit of that.

**[01:37:04] Ben Rubin**
> Again, these are some of my sketchbooks, in terms of the classroom, you know, just sharing some different ideas that I've had using recycled materials and journaling to kids outside.

**[01:37:25] Ben Rubin**
> This is actually the Cornell webcam with birds.

**[01:37:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's something that we use often in the classroom.

**[01:37:36] Ben Rubin**
> You know, sort of rambling, but yeah, that's really it.

**[01:37:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> What Ben, what did the kids gravitate toward when you take them outside?

**[01:37:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Is there anything that they're really drawn to?

**[01:37:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> it activity like a bird that flies into the view?

**[01:37:55] Ben Rubin**
> What draws them?

**[01:37:57] Ben Rubin**
> You know, being able to take

**[01:38:00] Ben Rubin**
> things or trace things.

**[01:38:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, hands-on stuff, of course.

**[01:38:06] Ben Rubin**
> I feel like just being outside is, they're inside all day.

**[01:38:14] Ben Rubin**
> Public school is really just marching from one room to the other and sometimes just being able to get a sense of where the sun is in the sky and spending a half an hour outside makes a big difference.

**[01:38:29] Ben Rubin**
> It's this little wall up courtyard.

**[01:38:31] Ben Rubin**
> The school was built by Italian immigrants or it was started with an Italian community a long time ago.

**[01:38:40] Ben Rubin**
> So there's some of this stuff.

**[01:38:41] Ben Rubin**
> There's the figs and the cherries that are from previous generations that most of it is just weeds.

**[01:38:55] Natalie Fleming**
> What I find exciting about your work is

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think something inherent in all of us that about growing food, that that basic thing that we have power over gives you a sense of power for the rest of your life.

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**
> But there's also a sort of a project inspired by that book with these postcards of people from around the world writing messages to, you know, basically migrating peoples.

**[01:40:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned Ben, school is Rochester International Academy.

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is a sanctuary city, controversially this year, of course, and the population is very diverse and includes brand new immigrants, some of them from Afghanistan who incidentally Ben helped bring to Rochester.

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[00:20:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm here in Rochester, New York, working in the public school system teaching visual arts the last three years, sort of jumping into the hot seat.

**[00:20:22] Ben Rubin**
> There was a big shortage after the pandemic, so it was kind of a career change opportunity, before that worked with John Scholl with the Enable Project, so the three Princeton prosthetics spent a number of years in Southeast Asia working on different projects related to education, I guess in terms of tonight, what I'm going to share is a plan for taking one of the unused outdoor spaces at the school where I teach.

**[00:21:00] Ben Rubin**
> and turning it into an outdoor classroom, basically a nature peace classroom.

**[00:21:06] Ben Rubin**
> There was a small grant that I got over the summer to do some training and get certified with some different strategies on that.

**[00:21:15] Ben Rubin**
> I figured I'd just share it's a small project, but I can share that and get some ideas from all of you.

**[00:21:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:21:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:21:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The incomparable Indie Singh is here.

**[00:21:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you turn on your video and say hello?

**[00:21:29] indy singh**
> Of course.

**[00:21:30] indy singh**
> Hey guys.

**[00:21:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's up?

**[00:21:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How are you doing?

**[00:21:37] indy singh**
> Faze right now.

**[00:21:38] indy singh**
> How do I do this?

**[00:21:40] indy singh**
> Should I land first or should I keep the spaceship?

**[00:21:44] indy singh**
> What's up everybody?

**[00:21:46] indy singh**
> I hope you all are doing well.

**[00:21:48] indy singh**
> Thank you all for all the restoration work.

**[00:21:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indie, think you're going behind the moon right now.

**[00:21:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> You're breaking up.

**[00:22:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Alright, let's see.

**[00:22:01] indy singh**
> Let's see, let's see, let's see.

**[00:22:02] indy singh**
> Let's see if you guys can hear me now.

**[00:22:04] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, we got a flavor for Indy.

**[00:22:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indy, I've noticed you've been really active.

**[00:22:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> seems like you really got something great going on.

**[00:22:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'd like an update, but your connectivity is not good at this moment.

**[00:22:16] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> looks like everything was really high right now on my end.

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure?

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> bit more.

**[00:22:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can mention, Katie and Ben, that our ritual here at the ERA, which may change soon, is that ERA members become ERA members when they introduce themselves at a town hall meeting, which you have now done.

**[00:22:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a week later, assuming there are no objections, you've become full-fledged members with all the rights and responsibilities, too, which really basically just include checking in every so often, subscribing to our social media, findable through our website, and then

**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Passing on social media that resonate with you when you think would resonate with your network To other people in your network.

**[00:23:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It is also possible to Donate to the ERA.

**[00:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's a link on our website, and I am laboring mightily to try to get a Majority of our members to become recurring donors at whatever level they would like even a dollar a month because that It's a good thing and it actually tells us a little something about what we can count on All I'm going through routine issues here, I will mention that we do have our annual general meeting next month on May 14th, I believe and in preparation for that We're all Trying to assess what has happened since a year ago, and I am now putting into the chat a form Where Natalie

**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> mentioned that he just published a book, and Steve can mention that he just published a book, and Rob can mention that he just published another article, and we will try to bring all of that together in time from May 14th.

**[00:24:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, well, you will of course give our speakers your undivided attention.

**[00:24:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> I urge you to click the link.

**[00:24:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This form is basically untested, and see if you can put some information in it, and then I'll know if it works because I'm going be sending it to everybody in the ERA, all four to five hundred of us.

**[00:24:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:24:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First guest and speaker and soon-to-be ERA member is Steve Apfelbaum, a book of whose I have in my living room, and I started quite some time ago when I heard about him through Bio4Climate, and apparently the author of many books with more to come.

**[00:24:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Steve, give us your story, please.

**[00:24:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well, where do I start?

**[00:25:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, as a young child, nature was my passion, my bliss, uh, rehabilitating injured and raising baby animals was, uh, I did and was on a veterinary medicine tract to work with wild animals and, uh, and in vet school and a professor said, Hey, you love canoeing in wilderness.

**[00:25:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's a grant to do some research in a wilderness area.

**[00:25:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I said, Oh, wow, you mean like not having to take care of dogs and city cats?

**[00:25:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it turned out we got the grant and spent basically fast forward 40 years of staying the fire ecology of the boundary water, wilderness, and Quedicope Provincial Park couldn't be

**[00:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Northeastern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario and basically went on to graduate school as a result of that opportunity.

**[00:26:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> And my whole life has been focused on studying the healthiest ecosystems on the planet, measuring biodiversity, a whole range of functions, publishing technical articles, learning what we can from those systems and then emulating that and bringing that into design in urban systems and rural systems.

**[00:26:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So learning from caribou and bison and working with grazing systems, the soil carbon cowboy series that you may or may not have heard about, that's our work with Alan Williams and Gabe Brown.

**[00:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a whole bunch of people.

**[00:27:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now we've worked on about 100 million acres bringing improved grazing and provided the science and are continuing to expand on the climate mitigation opportunities and the biodiversity mitigation opportunities.

**[00:27:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That introduced me to the need for translating the science into market language.

**[00:27:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We put together in 2009 with Ratan Lal and a number of the top soil scientists on the planet, a carbon measurement protocol that became a global standard.

**[00:27:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Vera published it as VM0021.

**[00:27:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've subsequently converted that into a family of standards called the Regenerative Standard.

**[00:27:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> And last year alone, we have with project developers

**[00:28:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for about a million acres of improved grazing in North America and were on a track to hit 20 to 30 million acres in five or six years.

**[00:28:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> One of the things that we learned during the process of trying to work at landscape scales and get the science right and get the policy right and get the market right and get the trust and transparency right, was that there was no way to ecological literacy across any of those subjects.

**[00:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we spun out a company.

**[00:28:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> I retired from my company, Applied Ecological Services, about in 2021 and spun up a non-profit called Applied Ecological Institute.

**[00:28:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm Wisconsin based, Katie.

**[00:28:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're in southern Wisconsin.

**[00:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these heads.

**[00:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that organization has started a new company called Stratifix, which is a subscriber SaaS-based business that is basically bringing 200 or more datasets and mapping capabilities to any piece of land in the U.S.

**[00:29:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> currently and North America, less detailed.

**[00:29:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> But you can look at any piece of property.

**[00:29:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll immediately have the land ownership and all sorts of other amazing data, assessed value, value of improvements.

**[00:29:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then there's nearly 200 natural resource datasets that you can apply to that property.

**[00:29:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can do scenario planning for evaluating different land uses, whether it be restoration,

**[00:30:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for agricultural practices, adapt to multi-pedic grazing versus continuous conventional no-till versus whatever pillage.

**[00:30:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can evaluate different crops.

**[00:30:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you could do highest and best value optimization using actual real-time spot pricing for the commodities and all the NASS USDA data sets with the average soil yields and the economics for every county in the US.

**[00:30:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So that's spun up and that's really helping us do restoration at scale, including we used it to do about a billion and a half acre prioritization of all the grassland restoration opportunities in North America.

**[00:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's now being used by the voluntary carbon market by a number of players to go out and secure.

**[00:31:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or the landowner partnering relationships to do the improved grazing.

**[00:31:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a lot of that stuff that I've been working on.

**[00:31:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Education is kind of what brought me to contact you, John.

**[00:31:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> I've been teaching for about 12 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, co-teaching a class on the future of coastal ecosystems on the planet.

**[00:31:26] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then with COVID, I kind of retired from that job because it was no fun teaching over Zoom.

**[00:31:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, the personal relationships and the field work with the students is what really kind of made everything work well.

**[00:31:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> But there's an incredible unmet demand for bringing ecosystem restoration to not just the landowners that may have no technical training and what they want is, you know, how to

**[00:32:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do I do this?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do first?

**[00:32:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> What's it going to cost?

**[00:32:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> What are the downsides?

**[00:32:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, what are my decisions and how significant are they or can I grow into it lightly and kind of learn along the route?

**[00:32:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what I've proposed to the ecological society is a series of two-hour primers which I've already been teaching.

**[00:32:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> I did two of them in the past month with them and then a six or a 12-hour online class and then one week classes in the field in various places around the starting here in Wisconsin, southern Wisconsin.

**[00:32:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> we're doing huge coastal restorations in North Carolina right now.

**[00:32:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're doing huge projects, setting up a very large project in Alabama.

**[00:33:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've worked throughout the Americas, Central and South America.

**[00:33:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's all sorts of opportunities in different geographies to leverage those different geographies for training and really building a capacity to take restoration as a primary nature-based solution package to climate and water and biodiversity and food.

**[00:33:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> And, you know, also nutrition, all this to civilization, basically.

**[00:33:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> So I've been trying to work on that and what AEI is spending out our solutions and education around some of our biggest challenges.

**[00:33:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> Climate being one, biodiversity being another food, nutritional density and, you know, we can go on and on and on.

**[00:33:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a bunch of other things.

**[00:33:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We started a new food company.

**[00:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> me with the former chairman of Whole Foods, who was the chairman for 23 years, called the Client Food Company, that's focused on not just perennializing agriculture, but using long, long-used and traditional native foods that nobody pays attention to unless it's prepared right and then you ask, what the hell is this?

**[00:34:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're commercializing.

**[00:34:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We have FDA approval for human consumption of two native perigraphs, grains, and the nutritional value, this is a reference for genuine wild rye, almost for genitus, 23 to 28 percent digestible protein, incredibly well-balanced macro and micronutrient profiles, taste profiles, which I can't taste the difference, but the chefs that we've hired can

**[00:35:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> you know say things that I never quite understand but we're introducing that into a cookie line that may be at Whole Foods and we've just released a new cookie an old cookie that was the very famous cookie here in Madison Wisconsin called the gorilla cookie and soon we'll be introducing Virginia Wilder I flower into that cookie so Katie if you if you happen down into Madison gonna go to the Willy Street co-op and get gorilla cookies which was the anti-war protester cookie of choice in the 60s Vietnam War and now it's introduced the original recipe that was lost in time and nearly extinct never said that about a cookie so I think I think you know one of the questions I had is how do we bring non-science people to

**[00:36:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> recognize value in a cookie, cookie monster restoration once the cookies are over there or banned their monsters.

**[00:36:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do we bring people to see value and want to participate in, you know, participatory learning, you know, hands-on training and also maybe on ramping, you know, less formal and more ways for people to don't go to festivals.

**[00:36:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Don't ask, don't ask.

**[00:36:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'll shut up.

**[00:36:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anyways, that's a question and how could we get the word out to bring more people to some of this training and ecological societies trying to figure out how they can offer continuing education credit CEUs so that students can, you know, into this and see value in their career track.

**[00:37:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> can also see value with their you know with their college you know the degree the credits they get but there may be other ways to bring value that you know I'm not aware of that would bring other people to the table so that's my core question and what why are we stuck to you John.

**[00:37:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting well uh we will we will consider that question momentarily is there more you want to tell us about yourself or any of your specific projects um oh there's so many it's just simply not you know there's there's so much going on so um I can tell you we're the proud parents of the latest red wolf litter that has been born on the planet we a group of us bought 15,000 acres of dewatered ditched coastal north Carolina picosan wetland

**[00:38:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> restore it and now our project is delayed for until mid-June because we have one of the only red wolf litters on the planet that's taken up residency on our this property which is a really wonderful problem to have but you know nothing wrong with delaying the restoration of hydrology in this large acreage for a couple weeks so yeah yeah there's that and then uh we we got invited to albania to look at the coastal well a couple things um our illustrious president and his family walked into albania i don't think he had a direct hand uh and they they basically said we want to do a big resort here but the national park is in the way and they changed the boundary of a dedicated national park

**[00:39:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> give that family access to prime national park land.

**[00:39:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're doing a project with architect Jeanne Gang, Studio Gang in Chicago, a MacArthur fellow that's leveraging a different way to enforce a national reserve.

**[00:39:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're not going to call it a national park.

**[00:39:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So working on a project like that and just a whole bunch of projects.

**[00:39:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Northern Great Plains adaptive multi-pedal grazing study is finding out the same things that we published and you saw in the Soil Carbon Cowboys movie movies or videos.

**[00:39:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> A bunch of so many things.

**[00:39:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's just so exciting.

**[00:39:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Steve, as I understand it, Applied Ecological Services is now a part of RES, whatever that is.

**[00:39:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it still your base of operations or is this?

**[00:39:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> No.

**[00:40:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, I in 2021 I merged applied ecological services about just under 400 staff and 19 offices into REZ and I made a commitment to stand board for two years and after one year the the non-profit work was so exciting and overwhelmingly drawing me that I retired and set up the institute and where I now call home is we my wife and I and four others bought a country club and converted it into a place called the Three Waters Reserve and it's a public a public park that we restored hired the university was constant executive chef and he runs the food and beverage service and so my bit my my office is the basement

**[00:41:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> That used to be the pro shop in the golf course.

**[00:41:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's now a field station for training You know new we call it baby colleges that grow into adult ecologists and my wife Susan Lenhart and others are behind the educational programming and you know foisting that upon the world with wonderful interns that have amazing epiphanies by working in the field of restoration and Measurement and so forth So is this the Institute for Applied Ecology that you're talking about?

**[00:41:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, that it's the applied ecological Institute The Institute can you give us a URL?

**[00:41:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> I got it here.

**[00:41:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> E Institute org.

**[00:41:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah Yeah, I think the Institute for Applied Ecology is in Milbrook New York.

**[00:41:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, it's in Corvallis, Oregon Which is oh, that's right.

**[00:41:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's right.

**[00:41:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay

**[00:42:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, yeah, you know, we have a slogan in the era, we say, what can we all do together that we can't do individually, but and we'll pursue that question in a moment, but you seem to be doing it all individually, although I'm beginning to think that at this point, you've got an army behind you.

**[00:42:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not, it's not as big of a wonderful group of a family of, you know, staff and partners that I used to have.

**[00:42:34] SteveApfelbaum**

**[00:43:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's what we're doing.

**[00:43:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> And trying to nail the science and nail the communication and, you know, the art.

**[00:43:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> So Peter Bick, the film producer, working with us, we're working together on the grazing stuff and the on the climate food stuff.

**[00:43:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've got another whole team of communicators that are working on on that and regenerative ag.

**[00:43:28] SteveApfelbaum**

**[00:43:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not a it's not all under one.

**[00:43:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's it's a wonderful growing team.

**[00:43:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you asked a specific question, which is one that we've been thrashing about ever since we started, which is, how do we somehow get more and more people to understand, you know, that this is this is the most exciting thing about being alive in this particular universe, as far as we know, that

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The future is at stake, and for the coming generation, there's really nothing.

**[00:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's no better prescription for good life than to get on and say, I have the opportunity to save the future.

**[00:44:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But to do that, they have to understand that it's true and that they really can make a difference.

**[00:44:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so how do you get the word out?

**[00:44:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're doing education, I gather, at several different levels.

**[00:44:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I saw that Mike had a comment a bit a few minutes ago.

**[00:44:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Mike, do you want to introduce yourself since you came in a little bit late?

**[00:44:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then also start the discussion about how we can help amplify the kind of work that Steve is doing and that we're all trying to do.

**[00:44:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I apologize.

**[00:44:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> I wasn't following the chat.

**[00:44:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> was trying to...

**[00:44:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, that's okay.

**[00:44:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> If there's questions.

**[00:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys.

**[00:44:56] Mike Lynn**
> No worries.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> Thank you, John.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> I apologize, everybody, for coming in late.

**[00:45:00] Mike Lynn**
> But yeah, you had mentioned you had asked the question is there a way that we could get this in front of other people for continuing education As far as at the academic level, I'm not sure but I know there are institutions that offer Training such as the things like you mentioned Matter of fact, I'm doing one for an organization next month on living shorelines that The people that attend are typically engineers Landscape architects because they come to here for whether it's an hour long to our long full day long And then they get their professional accreditation continuing education hours.

**[00:45:34] Mike Lynn**
> So that might be one avenue.

**[00:45:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's helpful for you to pursue Yeah, we we've been doing that for years with with ASLA and with the the engineering You know groups as well and doing soil bioengineering and the whole range a lot of mine reclamation a lot of river My professor was lonely appalled and river physics and hydrology

**[00:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> been teaching that and but how do you there's so many opportunities how do you build a team around the opportunities and then divide and conquer is what I'm trying to figure out and I've learned a few things you know I thought it was holy as a scientist to get you know 300 people to review a paper and Peter Peter Big it's 600,000 website hits a month on the the the grazing videos now 17 million hits so far in in like 113 countries I can't believe it I mean why do we do science papers why do we write videos seem to be so incredibly you know good interesting yeah so um

**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just want to tag a few future conversations I'd like to have with you and what we shouldn't take at the time.

**[00:47:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have, as you may know, I now know I should send it to you, a project cooking in Panama, where we've said the watershed is a strategic global importance, and that the drought from recent years had such a huge financial impact that it's a really interesting laboratory and demonstration site for trying to show that you can fix climate by fixing ecosystems.

**[00:47:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we're just beginning to get some action on the ground.

**[00:47:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We imagine that when we do that, we're going to have to mobilize lots of people to come up with solutions that better their lives and improve, have measurable impact on local climate and perhaps regional climate.

**[00:47:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it sounds like your software and your expertise might really fit in very well there, so I'll follow up with you on that.

**[00:48:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've done several projects in South America and Costa Rica that have been watershed based restoration projects that we talk about and a bunch of a bunch in North America as well.

**[00:48:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right.

**[00:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The other thing I'll mention is my own answer to the question of how do we engage young people?

**[00:48:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben and I have talked about this a lot.

**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think every school and every university on the planet has got too much pavement, too much parking lots, too much grass, not enough native species.

**[00:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lots and lots of students who are desperate to do something meaningful about the future they're told is coming and probably alumni who would like to give money for a named Miyawaki Forest or another project of that sort.

**[00:48:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would become an outdoor living laboratory and create not just a patch of research.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> stored land, but a cohort of ecosystem restores who know what to do and can fan away from their schools and get it going.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Quaqui Wildcat, one of our ERA members, and I are talking about trying to get something along these lines going, but that recipe, whether it's Miyawaki Forest or some other school-based program, I think should be part of everybody's curriculum.

**[00:49:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I don't know quite a few schools over the years.

**[00:49:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> example, we talked about Seneca Falls a little while ago, John, right in your neighborhood.

**[00:49:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> To do the 1,000-acre Seneca Meadows restoration project around Seneca Falls there, we hired high school students and they collected with us native plant species seeds for prairie wetland savanna.

**[00:50:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a forest from about a about a 30 mile radius.

**[00:50:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then we paid students and we made flats, soil, and seeds available and instructions.

**[00:50:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> And they grew the plants.

**[00:50:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> then for that restoration, we bought plants back with one stipulation that they had to come back with somebody, a relative, a parent, a friend, and plant the plant materials with us.

**[00:50:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And we've done that.

**[00:50:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did that on several mining projects, the Flambeau Mine up in Lady Smith, Wisconsin, and the Jackson County Iron Mine in Black River Falls, starting in the in the mid 80s.

**[00:50:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> And now they're public parks now, these magnificent large landscapes.

**[00:50:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've created durable relationships through that mechanism with the with the community.

**[00:51:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these because now that the families come back to see the plants, they think they planted 20 years ago.

**[00:51:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really wonderful.

**[00:51:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interesting.

**[00:51:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And where are the stories told about these programs that we all agree should be replicated to tools all over the world?

**[00:51:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Seneca Falls story is told in the Audubon Nature Center there at the Seneca Meadows preserve right south of Rochester.

**[00:51:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the stories about Flambomine is told, you can go on the Rio Tinto website, they're so proud of it.

**[00:51:39] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Wisconsin DNR tells the story about those mining projects because instead of planting it with non-native or alfalfa, which is what was originally intended, we planted them with native vegetation, prairies and savanna vegetation, they're fantastic.

**[00:52:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> They just, who are just wildlife areas now, and recreation areas.

**[00:52:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I predict Ben Rubin and I are going to go to the Seneca, what's it called again?

**[00:52:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well it's, it's the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's right on the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> You guys are 45 minutes from there, or something like that.

**[00:52:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is pretty darn close.

**[00:52:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[00:52:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Steve, welcome.

**[00:52:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Steve, it's, it's, it's an amazing, it's work.

**[00:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see you're still going strong.

**[00:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we salute you.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> A couple.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> thank you.

**[00:52:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's an honor.

**[00:52:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, go for it, Natalie.

**[00:52:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, a couple thoughts.

**[00:52:46] Natalie Fleming**
> me, the big change to get, to get people engaged, when you focus on CO2, it's pretty depressing.

**[00:52:52] Natalie Fleming**
> But if, when you focus on the assistive restoration, you can really tie it to breaking the flood drought fire cycle.

**[00:53:01] Natalie Fleming**
> The CO2 focus, CO2 centrism is to me very depressing and slow moving, but eco-restoration is pretty dramatic and powerful.

**[00:53:14] Natalie Fleming**
> There's some fun things that we can do to teach people about climate and ecosystems and, I don't know, to me paragliding.

**[00:53:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I know this sounds crazy, but you talk about peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:25] Natalie Fleming**
> Paragliders, they fly.

**[00:53:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm a pilot.

**[00:53:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> Parasailers, parasailers, they fly and they don't wait for peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:36] Natalie Fleming**
> Right.

**[00:53:37] Natalie Fleming**
> They just get out there and do it and their life depends on understanding microclimates and how the landscape relates to the climate.

**[00:53:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And I do have a picture, I pulled up a slide on where I was down in Utah and they have a spot there, so I didn't actually fly, but they let me play with a kite for a little while.

**[00:53:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Not that crazy yet, but eventually I'll get there.

**[00:54:00] Natalie Fleming**
> I think that focusing on eco restoration over CO2 centrism in the water cycle, focus on the water cycle.

**[00:54:07] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a dramatic difference and it gets people excited because you can make a difference and you can make an immediate change.

**[00:54:13] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's, I think the CO2 is so depressing that people can't get past it and they don't feel like they can really do much about it.

**[00:54:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, we've learned that people are barren by trees because they can see it, see a tree and they don't understand soil carbon.

**[00:54:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's, you know, there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> And there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the soil carbon and all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we've been focusing on is peat and soil carbon projects first and forestry carbons less so.

**[00:54:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I'm a pilot and I'm what's incredible is how violent the winds and the turbulence are now.

**[00:55:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> compared to what they were over the years that I've been flying about 25 or 30 years.

**[00:55:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there are major changes that are occurring that I feel every time I get in the airplane, most every time.

**[00:55:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> So it's very, very frightening to think about flying under some of the conditions that now as a pilot where, you you take off in one place and the prediction isn't quite what it might be projected to be when you're trying to land somewhere.

**[00:55:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[00:55:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant, you have a comment and an observation.

**[00:55:39] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:55:41] sustainavistas**
> I think if we look at the process, mean, first it's not really trees or soil or carbon.

**[00:55:48] sustainavistas**
> I think we're generally talking about changing behavior.

**[00:55:54] sustainavistas**
> And something I'd like to point to, I think Joe has probably a time for us to maybe

**[00:56:00] sustainavistas**
> for me to jump on on and give an update, because we've, so see, we are the founder of my ecological founder of our group, Courtney of Balmeneu, which is more trees now in Dutch, started 14 years ago by himself for about the first five years, challenging the local council.

**[00:56:18] sustainavistas**
> So we just outside Amsterdam Schupper Airport in probably one of the densest population urban areas.

**[00:56:26] sustainavistas**
> And in the Netherlands it started with removing 1000 school tiles and putting, rescuing one tree from a local urban forest and planting that on a thousand schools plains.

**[00:56:39] sustainavistas**
> And that went on for five years and we've now 14 years grown into an organization that's saved, rescued and donated and transplanted in the Netherlands over three million free trees, siblings.

**[00:56:52] sustainavistas**
> 30,000 volunteers and we're now going to six countries, so Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland and France, which is

**[00:57:00] sustainavistas**
> last year started a kit of a project with five ecosystem registration communities of John D.

**[00:57:05] sustainavistas**
> Liu in Ireland, sort of Cree, in Vericelle, in France, Recoviva, in Italy, in Spain, we've just come back from Altiplana and also the EFC headquarters and then obviously we're in Dutch base, so we're spending two years developing training and education materials for that.

**[00:57:27] sustainavistas**
> But if you look at what we're doing, I really think we're probably the first organisation, there's one group in France and I'll correct me if I'm wrong in Australia or the USA or Canada or any other countries that they're doing it, but we basically use nature as a nursery and basically because we use 50 centimetre to two metre high trees, that's like our sweet spot, we can do bigger trees, but that's our sweet spot and these are five to 20-year-old settings, so we really

**[00:58:00] sustainavistas**
> starting with a far better base and then in the temperate north we actually rescue and save and our survival rate is 70 to 80 percent so and it's a free resource so we do about 150 species in the Netherlands and I think that so twice it's really mass participation of communities connecting people to nature and showing them an ecological solution as well as people can actually really scale so I mean this is probably one of the most incredible scalable solutions that's and and and so we would love people we if you look at our more trees now dot eco website we've got a whole communication toolkit we show our manuals our hands everything we've translated four languages but also we give it all away for nothing so have a look at that and I think it could be interesting to use that because if you can I mean we in the winter in our little area near airport skipway airport our biggest tree have we risked 140 000 trees and gave them away for free if we and that's any

**[00:59:00] sustainavistas**
> every day, every day for six months, 10, 20 year volunteers working on it, but if we got paid people, we got thousands of people to do this, and we could do it in 20 or 30 countries, we basically could really ramp up the carbon sequestration, but also change behavior, basically, and really.

**[00:59:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:59:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Grant, you have reminded me that it is indeed time for an update from you.

**[00:59:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll follow up for a report.

**[00:59:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you're right.

**[00:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You have a solution which has scaled and rallied tens of thousands of people.

**[00:59:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We really are in a planet with 8 billion.

**[00:59:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let's see how we can scale that up and then we spread the word.

**[00:59:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> think replicable models is really what we're all looking for in transferability to other systems.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yep.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Exactly.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you.

**[00:59:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you're in the Netherlands.

**[00:59:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> Did I hear that right?

**[00:59:56] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:57] sustainavistas**
> I'm actually looking...

**[01:00:00] sustainavistas**
> My son is, I'm actually in Canada, Quebec for a week, I'm actually looking at starting some trials up in Canada because I've just become a grandparent, so we'll be coming to Canada two or three times a year probably.

**[01:00:12] sustainavistas**
> So our first grandchild was just born in Montreal 19 days ago, so yeah, so I'm actually on a 20 hectare property, so I think this might be one of the first treehouses in Canada.

**[01:00:26] sustainavistas**
> So yeah, let's not take too much more time, but I think let's have a conversation in parallel.

**[01:00:37] sustainavistas**
> One other quick question to the group in order to join, do you know any members that are going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:47] sustainavistas**
> No, I do not.

**[01:00:48] sustainavistas**
> Okay, I'll put that in the email tomorrow, but if you can't follow that, it's probably often New York and London climate week is probably one of the highest profiles, about 40,000.

**[01:01:00] sustainavistas**
> And people go to Paris for three days and it's a really an epic event and a lot of submissions that got a lot of those solutions there and ecosystem restoration is a real big, okay, thanks guys.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thank you, Brett.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, great.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> It sounds like a way to think about transferability of the, you know, the, the.

**[01:01:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> How you change the behavior and less so what you're planning and unless that's critical, but to work across different ecosystems, that'd be great.

**[01:01:32] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, exactly.

**[01:01:33] sustainavistas**
> I mean, for example, one of the small projects, sorry, John, just we start, we kicked off this year, we did an eco fitness.

**[01:01:38] sustainavistas**
> So basically, not only working on the ecological fitness of the forest and the land, but we also work on the fitness and the health and mental fitness people at the same time.

**[01:01:47] sustainavistas**
> So we kick sort of that off this year.

**[01:01:49] sustainavistas**
> So there's some videos on that.

**[01:01:50] sustainavistas**
> That's why it was a bit of fun, but actually we have to pick it up.

**[01:01:53] sustainavistas**
> So we work from November to March for the trees at the moment.

**[01:01:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's basically our model.

**[01:01:57] sustainavistas**
> That's great.

**[01:01:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:01:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:02:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie, you just switched off your camera, but I'm hoping this is your moment to give us your presentation.

**[01:02:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, my friend just came out to see if I wanted some chicken that's a little bit too spicy for me.

**[01:02:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And to see if the kids in the dog can come out and play.

**[01:02:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, did you just say you wanted me to do the presentation now?

**[01:02:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I did.

**[01:02:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I did.

**[01:02:22] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, hopefully I don't start coughing like a crazy one.

**[01:02:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:02:27] Natalie Fleming**
> So, if you've followed me at all on LinkedIn, you know that I obsessed about the water cycle.

**[01:02:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think all problems I'll call every all the problems and ecosystems are caused by bare grounds and bare ground and lack of life.

**[01:02:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I blame everything on the desert and I blame everything on mineral dust just so you know just about.

**[01:02:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I had the opportunity to spend the winter in Salt Lake and it was pretty exciting for me to go back to Salt Lake.

**[01:02:58] Natalie Fleming**
> It is kind of the land of my children.

**[01:03:00] Natalie Fleming**

> And if you've been paying attention, they have a terrible crisis now where they have the great drought.

**[01:03:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I first got down there in October, I was able to stay on Mount Olympus.

**[01:03:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Olympus looking over the valley and it was absolutely beautiful.

**[01:03:29] Natalie Fleming**
> This picture right here is from there.

**[01:03:32] Natalie Fleming**
> on the mountain side, it has a beautiful forest on the mountain side.

**[01:03:39] Natalie Fleming**
> If you're not familiar with the landscaping of the Great Salt Lake, you've got, as the winds come in from the west, you've got a lot of bare ground.

**[01:03:48] Natalie Fleming**
> You have the salt flats, you have the Great Salt Lake, and then you have these massive huge, I should have written down the exact height of the mountains and to Mount Tipinogus and all these Mount Olympus, they're huge.

**[01:04:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or gargantuan.

**[01:04:02] Natalie Fleming**
> And these mountains are amazing because they really trap in, they have the potential to trap in the moisture.

**[01:04:09] Natalie Fleming**
> But they have been denuding and ripping landscaping and plants out over the last 20 or 30 years.

**[01:04:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I was there 30 years ago, there were orchards and lawns and conifers and deciduous.

**[01:04:27] Natalie Fleming**
> There were all manner of life was there.

**[01:04:30] Natalie Fleming**
> And because the community is trapped between the mountain and the lake, there's very little room for growth.

**[01:04:38] Natalie Fleming**
> And so they've been denuding it.

**[01:04:41] Natalie Fleming**
> as strangely, the rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Thanks.

**[01:04:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I'm going to try this chicken in a minute.

**[01:04:49] Natalie Fleming**
> The rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:52] Natalie Fleming**
> so the solution was to denude the earth some more and rip out more trees and grasses and shrubs.

**[01:04:58] Natalie Fleming**
> And after a minute,

**[01:05:00] Natalie Fleming**
> official of the neighbors.

**[01:05:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, those are some domesticated teenagers.

**[01:05:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Just a second here.

**[01:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're not hearing much of your background.

**[01:05:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, I can hear it.

**[01:05:19] Natalie Fleming**
> I was screaming at him.

**[01:05:22] Natalie Fleming**
> It's a subdivision here.

**[01:05:24] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a full neighborhood going on.

**[01:05:26] Natalie Fleming**
> So they've been denuding the earth and ripping out landscaping and trees.

**[01:05:31] Natalie Fleming**
> The cities have been paying people to rip out vegetation in order to save the water.

**[01:05:40] Natalie Fleming**
> The Great Salt Lake strike team, and their plan to save the lake is to direct all water from the watershed directly to the lake and skip any vegetation in the landscape along the way.

**[01:05:55] Natalie Fleming**
> So I found out three hours ago I'd be doing this presentation.

**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So can I can I share?

**[01:06:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes please.

**[01:06:03] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay so um desktop one you're going to see all my stuff here all the kids um here is a video I wasn't able to export this video to the right format so uh this is the rocks that they are landscaping with now there used to be vegetation here and ripped it out in order to not use water their focus is is stopping water usage they don't understand the water cycle not used so they put in this rock landscaping and you can hear the highway this is the landscaping that they've put in and while I was driving around the valley I would stop and take pictures and videos as I went along and I was just horrified so you see these rocks we see the tree above ahead um this is a you know you're looking at a quarter mile of rocks and as I step into the trees you're going to see what they ripped out to save water

**[01:07:01] Natalie Fleming**
> And you're going to see, you know, six foot tall grasses, trees, shrubs, and a little small riparian area.

**[01:07:08] Natalie Fleming**
> I had the sound on, you would hear the birds chirping.

**[01:07:12] Natalie Fleming**
> And this whole area is next to the lake.

**[01:07:16] Natalie Fleming**
> It's between the lake and Jordan River.

**[01:07:18] Natalie Fleming**
> And they ripped down all this vegetation.

**[01:07:21] Natalie Fleming**
> And I have videos of the machines continuing to rip out more and more vegetation.

**[01:07:25] Natalie Fleming**
> There is very little of this left.

**[01:07:29] Natalie Fleming**
> So this is, of course, a month ago.

**[01:07:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So the spring hasn't come yet.

**[01:07:33] Natalie Fleming**
> I should probably go back in a month when it's all green.

**[01:07:38] Natalie Fleming**
> But they've just ripped this all out and the soil was rich and thick and soft and moist.

**[01:07:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And these are the tall pompous grass that they have.

**[01:07:47] Natalie Fleming**
> And they're ripping this out to save the water and to conserve water, because this is obviously using water.

**[01:07:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And they don't even understand that water is not used, water is cycled.

**[01:08:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, um, it's pretty horrific.

**[01:08:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, sorry, let's put that over here.

**[01:08:05] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Let's see.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> How are we going to go to slide show, uh, please start.

**[01:08:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:13] Natalie Fleming**
> So I threw this together real quick.

**[01:08:15] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, there's a picture.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> The great.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it is a shrunk exponentially.

**[01:08:21] Natalie Fleming**
> How do I go to the next?

**[01:08:23] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, I gotta move you guys over where I can't see you anymore.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> I think.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> Because you're, I can't say anything.

**[01:08:30] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, there we go.

**[01:08:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's in the 1980s.

**[01:08:33] Natalie Fleming**
> was about 3000 square miles.

**[01:08:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And now it's down to 150.

**[01:08:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's down to less than a third of what it was before.

**[01:08:40] Natalie Fleming**
> And as the lake shrinks, um, they've got some serious problems.

**[01:08:48] Natalie Fleming**
> One of the next to the lake, this is I, I am LDS and we build chapels everywhere and under advisement of the local community.

**[01:08:57] Natalie Fleming**
> They were advised to landscape in this manner.

**[01:09:00] Natalie Fleming**
> To use rocks and I compare using rocks as landscaping as using skulls and bones to landscape rocks are the are the skull.

**[01:09:08] Natalie Fleming**
> They're the structure of the earth and the soil and the trees.

**[01:09:12] Natalie Fleming**
> That is the flesh of the earth.

**[01:09:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So imagine just ripping the flesh off of your arm, which is grotesque and expecting the blood to flow and it's not flowing.

**[01:09:20] Natalie Fleming**
> So we know from Zach wise and water stories about Lancaster and all these wonderful people that you're supposed to sink slow and spread the water and then get as much vegetation as you can out of it to get the body pump going.

**[01:09:33] Natalie Fleming**
> And as you can see this particular structure, they've done the opposite.

**[01:09:38] Natalie Fleming**
> The tall this next right next to this was seven foot tall pompous grass that was ripped out and this is right.

**[01:09:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is Lakefront property.

**[01:09:46] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was water conservation gone wrong.

**[01:09:50] Natalie Fleming**
> If we do not have plants, you're not going to have rain.

**[01:09:54] Natalie Fleming**
> lot of people think the plants come because of the rain, but it's just like the chicken and the egg.

**[01:10:00] Natalie Fleming**
> to have vegetation and plants and great soil to keep the biotic pump going.

**[01:10:04] Natalie Fleming**
> I need to explain the bi...

**[01:10:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I can't let me put you back up there.

**[01:10:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I don't think you do actually.

**[01:10:09] Natalie Fleming**
> I do it.

**[01:10:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Everybody here gets it.

**[01:10:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[01:10:11] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:10:12] Natalie Fleming**
> can skip, so I don't have to explain the biotic pump.

**[01:10:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I can do that, but I think you guys are all versed in it.

**[01:10:19] Natalie Fleming**
> So the water cycle is completely biological in line out.

**[01:10:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And it's transpiration as an engine.

**[01:10:27] Natalie Fleming**
> so you all know about Pseudonose, Miserengi, and other mushroom spores and pollens that cloud seed at warm temperatures.

**[01:10:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So I don't need to explain that to you.

**[01:10:38] Natalie Fleming**
> So all of this, you already know?

**[01:10:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I think we are, we're here because we all share the same basic understanding.

**[01:10:48] Natalie Fleming**
> So here is the view from the place I was initially staying at.

**[01:10:51] Natalie Fleming**
> it's just beautiful, these mountains, and there's a great biodiversity of trees.

**[01:10:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And my plan for the Great Salt Lake would be to harvest all of the seeds,

**[01:11:00] Natalie Fleming**
> on this and set up nurseries and the mountains on the other side of the valley are barren.

**[01:11:06] Natalie Fleming**
> And so if we took the trees and expanded the forestry system, but they're cutting down trees, they're cutting down conifers because they all use water.

**[01:11:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it was very heartbreaking to see.

**[01:11:20] Natalie Fleming**
> the ancient Amazonians, they used the mountains to their advantage to trap in the as the clouds came in, as the moisture came in, they created water retention landscapes and built structures to really maximize vegetation and trap the water in.

**[01:11:35] Natalie Fleming**
> the Great Salt Lake in the Wasatch Front, that area has a great advantage with that great mountain that could trap in an incredible amount of water.

**[01:11:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is what I saw everywhere where by mandate the trees, the homes were built with rock landscaping, which to me is kind of like Terminator where they're walking on the skulls.

**[01:11:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the bones of the earth.

**[01:12:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Can you explain to you how and why?

**[01:12:02] Natalie Fleming**
> they're just directoring all vegetation over.

**[01:12:05] Natalie Fleming**
> then the lake has the lake bed because it does not drain anywhere else.

**[01:12:12] Natalie Fleming**
> It has a lot of arsenic lead in mercury and selenium that as it dries out, it's kicking that dust.

**[01:12:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And the ice nucleating temperatures of that dust, meaning its rainfall potential is very, very low.

**[01:12:25] Natalie Fleming**
> It has to be super, super, super cold in order for it to stimulate rainfall.

**[01:12:28] Natalie Fleming**
> So that's super bad.

**[01:12:32] Natalie Fleming**
> It was super depressing for me to see this because when I left, there were orchards and herds and all sorts of things.

**[01:12:38] Natalie Fleming**
> this unleashing pollutants, there's a health crisis because of the asthma and heart disease.

**[01:12:43] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got arsenic in the air.

**[01:12:46] Natalie Fleming**
> They've convinced a lot of local farmers to redirect water from the farm to the lake.

**[01:12:53] Natalie Fleming**
> And they think it's gonna help.

**[01:12:54] Natalie Fleming**
> So you already know what temperature, okay, don't need to give you that.

**[01:12:59] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:13:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, this is a view, a picture I took this winter when the snow was there and you can see that from the side of the mountain, you can see the clouds forming and rumbling on this side.

**[01:13:12] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on that.

**[01:13:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on any of this.

**[01:13:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So, on the right is a picture of what I, I took both these pictures.

**[01:13:22] Natalie Fleming**
> These were side by side.

**[01:13:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And on the right, this is along a riverbed, the Jordan River.

**[01:13:28] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping out massive amounts.

**[01:13:30] Natalie Fleming**
> I could show you the whole video of them piling up the dirt and shipping it off and then saying, we're having a drought.

**[01:13:36] Natalie Fleming**
> I just don't know why.

**[01:13:37] Natalie Fleming**
> if they, yeah, I don't know the polite way to tell them they're all stupid.

**[01:13:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> Natalie, did you see any good examples of landscaping that might be nothing at all?

**[01:13:53] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping everything out that they consider the rock landscaping is good.

**[01:13:57] Natalie Fleming**
> This right here.

**[01:13:58] Natalie Fleming**
> This isn't Saratoga Springs.

**[01:14:00] Natalie Fleming**
> If you look closely, those are logs.

**[01:14:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the only trees I found in that area when I was driving all of that particular area.

**[01:14:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the logs.

**[01:14:10] Natalie Fleming**
> They were building new subdivisions.

**[01:14:11] Natalie Fleming**
> They're building massive, massive subdivisions and they obviously they cut down some tree.

**[01:14:17] Natalie Fleming**
> But the focus is that that uses water.

**[01:14:20] Natalie Fleming**
> They're really obsessed with removing anything that uses water.

**[01:14:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Natalie, do you talk, do you give this presentation in Salt Lake City?

**[01:14:33] Natalie Fleming**
> No, I made this presentation an hour ago for tonight.

**[01:14:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you?

**[01:14:38] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact these people.

**[01:14:40] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email address.

**[01:14:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact Brian Stede.

**[01:14:43] Natalie Fleming**
> He is at the University of Utah.

**[01:14:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I got a really good reference person, really top notch person.

**[01:14:49] Natalie Fleming**
> He me the reference.

**[01:14:50] Natalie Fleming**
> He didn't really return the calls.

**[01:14:52] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email addresses of everybody on the right team.

**[01:14:55] Natalie Fleming**
> everybody, I don't know how to approach them without being a jerk, really, without telling them they're.

**[01:15:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Scrooming things up because who am I and they're hydrologists and geologists and all these.

**[01:15:05] Natalie Fleming**
> These are university hydrologists, but PhDs and post PhDs and teach at the university and who am I to go and tell them they're.

**[01:15:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> You know, the, the LDS church, we worked on the city creek.

**[01:15:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, the, uh, the mall, we were the folks that brought.

**[01:15:22] SteveApfelbaum**
> Uh, city creek to the surface that runs to the mall.

**[01:15:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the, the for profit arm.

**[01:15:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the foundation arm of the Mormon church.

**[01:15:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, very focused on the water desert ranch million acre ranch.

**[01:15:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're trying to figure out how to, you know, I wonder if the LDS angle rather than.

**[01:15:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Going to the city would be worth doing.

**[01:15:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> then the other angle is, um, we're working with the CEO of, uh, who bought big power mountain.

**[01:16:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's 20,000 acres.

**[01:16:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's really interested in setting a regional example of how to restore the water cycle.

**[01:16:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was really trying to get to eco of the ag reserves, which is the for business entity.

**[01:16:16] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was unable to break through and I am LDS and I've talked to my bishop.

**[01:16:22] Natalie Fleming**
> said, who do I talk to other than embarrass the church on LinkedIn, which I did.

**[01:16:27] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, maybe you can help me if you have the contacts.

**[01:16:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Send me an email and I'll see if the contacts are still viable.

**[01:16:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because we worked with them for six or seven years.

**[01:16:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I lived in Roosevelt, Utah and became very close with leaders in the church.

**[01:16:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because there's so many Jack Mormons and Roosevelt, they were afraid they were going to lose the tribe out there.

**[01:16:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So he even went after little Jewish boys like me to indoctrinate us.

**[01:17:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Just so you know, Jack Mormons are Mormons that don't quite abide.

**[01:17:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> No, I know that.

**[01:17:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I know that.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Oh, I know.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> I just saw everybody else listening.

**[01:17:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> I know what a Jack Mormon is.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> You're from the mountainside.

**[01:17:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So when I was there for the first month, I didn't understand why the lake was shrinking because I didn't actually go through the valley the first month.

**[01:17:20] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I've got some great shots.

**[01:17:21] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was good.

**[01:17:24] Natalie Fleming**
> The landowner actually wanted to clear something.

**[01:17:25] Natalie Fleming**
> So you can see a lot of bare ground that here with this forest, the mountain sides don't have many trees over there.

**[01:17:32] Natalie Fleming**
> And there were certain sides that had more trees.

**[01:17:35] Natalie Fleming**
> So these are the beautiful views that I got to see.

**[01:17:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I guess that's the end of that.

**[01:17:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> And those are big fire scars.

**[01:17:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those aren't from logging.

**[01:17:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those are wildfire scars from the early 20s and 1910.

**[01:17:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did the master plan for the open space system for Salt Lake City.

**[01:17:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's really interesting how fires played a big role.

**[01:17:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ranching and early fires.

**[01:18:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, if, if I'll send you my information, if you can help in there, there's several different, I could tell you all the stories of all the ways I tried to get in and try to reach the right people.

**[01:18:12] Natalie Fleming**
> But I do have the list of email address of everybody on the great Salt Lake strike team, but I have hesitated to email them because who is Natalie Fleming to go in and tell them.

**[01:18:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Natalie Fleming is now acquainted with Steve Applebaum, who it turns out has got roots in the area.

**[01:18:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if it is Natalie's diagnosis, roughly correct that they're doing almost exactly the wrong thing if they want to turn this around.

**[01:18:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're desertifying the area and not building capacity for water retention and for in the soil system and for lagging the runoff, the hydrograph.

**[01:18:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everything's running off the land so quickly.

**[01:18:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So yeah, it's the right, it's the right thing, but the church isn't easy to do.

**[01:19:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> to unless you get to the for-profit arm because they're paying for a lot of these problems.

**[01:19:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're, you know, the community suffering, the erosion and infrastructure damages are really significantly expensive.

**[01:19:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So I'm pretty distressed because at church they announced that they're going to do this great program to reduce vegetation on all the churches across the world and I want to go to them.

**[01:19:23] Natalie Fleming**
> I know they're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do this and I'm like who do I tell them that because Brigham Young taught us we're supposed to make the earth as a garden of Eden not Mars and that picture there of everything's going dark on me all of a sudden.

**[01:19:40] Natalie Fleming**
> That picture is, it looks like you're looking for the rover on it.

**[01:19:45] Natalie Fleming**
> It's so bad and I really want to sit down with them and say they're going to spend hundreds of millions possibly a billion dollars to do massive eco-destruction believing they're doing the right thing.

**[01:20:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We'll give Rob Lewis a chance to vent here.

**[01:20:03] Natalie Fleming**
> can see that his head is exploding.

**[01:20:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Go, Rob.

**[01:20:09] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Well, wow, what a great presentation.

**[01:20:12] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> thank you so much for what you're doing and a couple things.

**[01:20:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> One, in terms of who is Natalie Fleming, you may have to go to small groups of people and spread your story.

**[01:20:24] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And then Natalie Fleming will be someone with 100 angry citizens behind her.

**[01:20:28] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> That makes a big difference in whether city officials will listen.

**[01:20:33] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> the main thing I want to mention is when you mentioned the rains disappearing and as he described that situation, I was hearing me on over and over.

**[01:20:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Nicely, the situation he described.

**[01:20:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> He talked about the carrier component and the trigger component.

**[01:20:53] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And the carrier component is the moisture that comes in from a larger system.

**[01:20:58] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Mediterranean sea in the case of Mediterranean sea.

**[01:21:07] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> It's Salt Lake that's providing the moisture, and then you have the trigger, which is the vegetation.

**[01:21:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So they're reproducing the desertification, as Steve said, but in a particular way, very similar to what Mian was talking about.

**[01:21:26] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**

**[01:21:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**

**[01:21:54] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**

**[01:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I think he's right, Natalie, you mentioned today that you're thinking about politics, but I actually think that your best path to politics might well be to really say, this is who Natalie Fleming is on this topic.

**[01:22:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's only going to become more and more clear that you were right and that you had the courage to say it.

**[01:22:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it actually, I think, would give you a very distinctive brand as a politician if you led with that.

**[01:22:41] Natalie Fleming**
> And this form of environmentalism is agreeable to both sides, both the left and the right politically.

**[01:22:49] Natalie Fleming**
> But one exciting thing for me is if we can get the LDS church on board is that LDS church has properties all over the world and they have a missionary mindset and they have missionaries all over the world.

**[01:23:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, and the missionaries are required to put it in a certain number of hours of service in their community, wherever they are.

**[01:23:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And that is non, non, across the lighting service.

**[01:23:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:23:10] Natalie Fleming**
> And so, getting these youth, getting the youth trained before they go on emissions on this stuff.

**[01:23:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is one thing.

**[01:23:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:23:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The one thing we can do together that we can't do individually is to have Natalie compare notes with Steve and to Steve see if he can find a way in based on the fact that he.

**[01:25:10] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anything that doesn't have the reflectivity, the albedo and the heating capacity and the imperviousness that they're creating would be better and unfortunately lawn is better than what they're doing, but it's not much better.

**[01:25:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> But yeah, we could talk about that further.

**[01:25:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've written a couple of papers on the role of landscapes in water management that might be useful.

**[01:25:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Not on the Jordan River, but we've looked at the changes in river flow over about 100 years and increasing increasing amount of runoff and increasing low flows of increased

**[01:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> 400 times over historic low flows and the displaying the river in the Chicago region, median flows have increased if I recall about 250 times on average over historic flows and the high flow events are three to five times the historic high flow flood events.

**[01:26:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's in a paper we did with Leopold.

**[01:26:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we're doing is we've flip-flopped the hydrology at the watershed scale from a groundwater recharge and infiltration and very long lag time.

**[01:26:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> The lag is the time period between the center of the mass of the rainfall distribution, the center of the mass of the runoff distribution hydrograph.

**[01:26:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've converted recharge-based systems into surface runoff based systems and it's every urban watershed.

**[01:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's very few that that hasn't happened to, and virtually every agricultural watershed, the same thing has happened.

**[01:27:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the story is very well understood, but what's not understood in urban areas, at least in the West, in Salt Lake, a lot of the people there are new customers, and they're interested in high dollar houses with minimal landscaping.

**[01:27:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's part of what the Netflix owner at Big Powder Mountain wants to get across to the people moving into these 20 million dollar homes.

**[01:27:41] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, one of the things that set me is that the church in good faith has donated hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water to go from the farmland to skip the farmland and go direct to the lake.

**[01:28:15] Natalie Fleming**
> I would love to speak with you, Steve, if we can get some.

**[01:28:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, I'd be glad.

**[01:28:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some other really critical issues that nobody knows about there, except the FAA, the white pelicans that nest out on, I can't remember the island, Pelican Island is what we called it.

**[01:28:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now they're feeding at the mouth of the Jordan River and the marshes.

**[01:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:30:03] Mike Lynn**

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[01:52:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Send me an email or click the link.

**[01:52:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let me know if the link works.

**[01:53:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see you again soon.

**[01:53:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys for the wonderful conversation.

**[01:53:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:53:11] Katie Ross**
> Lovely to see everyone.

**[01:53:12] Katie Ross**

```
**[00:20:22] Ben Rubin**
> There was a big shortage after the pandemic, so it was kind of a career change opportunity, before that worked with John Scholl with the Enable Project, so the three Princeton prosthetics spent a number of years in Southeast Asia working on different projects related to education, I guess in terms of tonight, what I'm going to share is a plan for taking one of the unused outdoor spaces at the school where I teach.

**[00:21:00] Ben Rubin**
> and turning it into an outdoor classroom, basically a nature peace classroom.

**[00:21:06] Ben Rubin**
> There was a small grant that I got over the summer to do some training and get certified with some different strategies on that.

**[00:21:15] Ben Rubin**
> I figured I'd just share it's a small project, but I can share that and get some ideas from all of you.

**[00:21:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:21:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:21:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The incomparable Indie Singh is here.

**[00:21:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you turn on your video and say hello?

**[00:21:29] indy singh**
> Of course.

**[00:21:30] indy singh**
> Hey guys.

**[00:21:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's up?

**[00:21:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How are you doing?

**[00:21:37] indy singh**
> Faze right now.

**[00:21:38] indy singh**
> How do I do this?

**[00:21:40] indy singh**
> Should I land first or should I keep the spaceship?

**[00:21:44] indy singh**
> What's up everybody?

**[00:21:46] indy singh**
> I hope you all are doing well.

**[00:21:48] indy singh**
> Thank you all for all the restoration work.

**[00:21:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indie, think you're going behind the moon right now.

**[00:21:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> You're breaking up.

**[00:22:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Alright, let's see.

**[00:22:01] indy singh**
> Let's see, let's see, let's see.

**[00:22:02] indy singh**
> Let's see if you guys can hear me now.

**[00:22:04] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, we got a flavor for Indy.

**[00:22:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indy, I've noticed you've been really active.

**[00:22:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> seems like you really got something great going on.

**[00:22:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'd like an update, but your connectivity is not good at this moment.

**[00:22:16] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> looks like everything was really high right now on my end.

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure?

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> bit more.

**[00:22:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can mention, Katie and Ben, that our ritual here at the ERA, which may change soon, is that ERA members become ERA members when they introduce themselves at a town hall meeting, which you have now done.

**[00:22:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a week later, assuming there are no objections, you've become full-fledged members with all the rights and responsibilities, too, which really basically just include checking in every so often, subscribing to our social media, findable through our website, and then

**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Passing on social media that resonate with you when you think would resonate with your network To other people in your network.

**[00:23:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It is also possible to Donate to the ERA.

**[00:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's a link on our website, and I am laboring mightily to try to get a Majority of our members to become recurring donors at whatever level they would like even a dollar a month because that It's a good thing and it actually tells us a little something about what we can count on All I'm going through routine issues here, I will mention that we do have our annual general meeting next month on May 14th, I believe and in preparation for that We're all Trying to assess what has happened since a year ago, and I am now putting into the chat a form Where Natalie

**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> mentioned that he just published a book, and Steve can mention that he just published a book, and Rob can mention that he just published another article, and we will try to bring all of that together in time from May 14th.

**[00:24:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, well, you will of course give our speakers your undivided attention.

**[00:24:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> I urge you to click the link.

**[00:24:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This form is basically untested, and see if you can put some information in it, and then I'll know if it works because I'm going be sending it to everybody in the ERA, all four to five hundred of us.

**[00:24:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:24:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First guest and speaker and soon-to-be ERA member is Steve Apfelbaum, a book of whose I have in my living room, and I started quite some time ago when I heard about him through Bio4Climate, and apparently the author of many books with more to come.

**[00:24:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Steve, give us your story, please.

**[00:24:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well, where do I start?

**[00:25:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, as a young child, nature was my passion, my bliss, uh, rehabilitating injured and raising baby animals was, uh, I did and was on a veterinary medicine tract to work with wild animals and, uh, and in vet school and a professor said, Hey, you love canoeing in wilderness.

**[00:25:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's a grant to do some research in a wilderness area.

**[00:25:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I said, Oh, wow, you mean like not having to take care of dogs and city cats?

**[00:25:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it turned out we got the grant and spent basically fast forward 40 years of staying the fire ecology of the boundary water, wilderness, and Quedicope Provincial Park couldn't be

**[00:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Northeastern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario and basically went on to graduate school as a result of that opportunity.

**[00:26:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> And my whole life has been focused on studying the healthiest ecosystems on the planet, measuring biodiversity, a whole range of functions, publishing technical articles, learning what we can from those systems and then emulating that and bringing that into design in urban systems and rural systems.

**[00:26:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So learning from caribou and bison and working with grazing systems, the soil carbon cowboy series that you may or may not have heard about, that's our work with Alan Williams and Gabe Brown.

**[00:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a whole bunch of people.

**[00:27:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now we've worked on about 100 million acres bringing improved grazing and provided the science and are continuing to expand on the climate mitigation opportunities and the biodiversity mitigation opportunities.

**[00:27:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That introduced me to the need for translating the science into market language.

**[00:27:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We put together in 2009 with Ratan Lal and a number of the top soil scientists on the planet, a carbon measurement protocol that became a global standard.

**[00:27:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Vera published it as VM0021.

**[00:27:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've subsequently converted that into a family of standards called the Regenerative Standard.

**[00:27:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> And last year alone, we have with project developers

**[00:28:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for about a million acres of improved grazing in North America and were on a track to hit 20 to 30 million acres in five or six years.

**[00:28:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> One of the things that we learned during the process of trying to work at landscape scales and get the science right and get the policy right and get the market right and get the trust and transparency right, was that there was no way to ecological literacy across any of those subjects.

**[00:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we spun out a company.

**[00:28:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> I retired from my company, Applied Ecological Services, about in 2021 and spun up a non-profit called Applied Ecological Institute.

**[00:28:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm Wisconsin based, Katie.

**[00:28:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're in southern Wisconsin.

**[00:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these heads.

**[00:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that organization has started a new company called Stratifix, which is a subscriber SaaS-based business that is basically bringing 200 or more datasets and mapping capabilities to any piece of land in the U.S.

**[00:29:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> currently and North America, less detailed.

**[00:29:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> But you can look at any piece of property.

**[00:29:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll immediately have the land ownership and all sorts of other amazing data, assessed value, value of improvements.

**[00:29:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then there's nearly 200 natural resource datasets that you can apply to that property.

**[00:29:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can do scenario planning for evaluating different land uses, whether it be restoration,

**[00:30:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for agricultural practices, adapt to multi-pedic grazing versus continuous conventional no-till versus whatever pillage.

**[00:30:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can evaluate different crops.

**[00:30:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you could do highest and best value optimization using actual real-time spot pricing for the commodities and all the NASS USDA data sets with the average soil yields and the economics for every county in the US.

**[00:30:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So that's spun up and that's really helping us do restoration at scale, including we used it to do about a billion and a half acre prioritization of all the grassland restoration opportunities in North America.

**[00:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's now being used by the voluntary carbon market by a number of players to go out and secure.

**[00:31:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or the landowner partnering relationships to do the improved grazing.

**[00:31:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a lot of that stuff that I've been working on.

**[00:31:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Education is kind of what brought me to contact you, John.

**[00:31:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> I've been teaching for about 12 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, co-teaching a class on the future of coastal ecosystems on the planet.

**[00:31:26] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then with COVID, I kind of retired from that job because it was no fun teaching over Zoom.

**[00:31:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, the personal relationships and the field work with the students is what really kind of made everything work well.

**[00:31:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> But there's an incredible unmet demand for bringing ecosystem restoration to not just the landowners that may have no technical training and what they want is, you know, how to

**[00:32:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do I do this?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do first?

**[00:32:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> What's it going to cost?

**[00:32:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> What are the downsides?

**[00:32:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, what are my decisions and how significant are they or can I grow into it lightly and kind of learn along the route?

**[00:32:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what I've proposed to the ecological society is a series of two-hour primers which I've already been teaching.

**[00:32:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> I did two of them in the past month with them and then a six or a 12-hour online class and then one week classes in the field in various places around the starting here in Wisconsin, southern Wisconsin.

**[00:32:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> we're doing huge coastal restorations in North Carolina right now.

**[00:32:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're doing huge projects, setting up a very large project in Alabama.

**[00:33:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've worked throughout the Americas, Central and South America.

**[00:33:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's all sorts of opportunities in different geographies to leverage those different geographies for training and really building a capacity to take restoration as a primary nature-based solution package to climate and water and biodiversity and food.

**[00:33:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> And, you know, also nutrition, all this to civilization, basically.

**[00:33:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> So I've been trying to work on that and what AEI is spending out our solutions and education around some of our biggest challenges.

**[00:33:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> Climate being one, biodiversity being another food, nutritional density and, you know, we can go on and on and on.

**[00:33:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a bunch of other things.

**[00:33:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We started a new food company.

**[00:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> me with the former chairman of Whole Foods, who was the chairman for 23 years, called the Client Food Company, that's focused on not just perennializing agriculture, but using long, long-used and traditional native foods that nobody pays attention to unless it's prepared right and then you ask, what the hell is this?

**[00:34:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're commercializing.

**[00:34:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We have FDA approval for human consumption of two native perigraphs, grains, and the nutritional value, this is a reference for genuine wild rye, almost for genitus, 23 to 28 percent digestible protein, incredibly well-balanced macro and micronutrient profiles, taste profiles, which I can't taste the difference, but the chefs that we've hired can

**[00:35:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> you know say things that I never quite understand but we're introducing that into a cookie line that may be at Whole Foods and we've just released a new cookie an old cookie that was the very famous cookie here in Madison Wisconsin called the gorilla cookie and soon we'll be introducing Virginia Wilder I flower into that cookie so Katie if you if you happen down into Madison gonna go to the Willy Street co-op and get gorilla cookies which was the anti-war protester cookie of choice in the 60s Vietnam War and now it's introduced the original recipe that was lost in time and nearly extinct never said that about a cookie so I think I think you know one of the questions I had is how do we bring non-science people to

**[00:36:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> recognize value in a cookie, cookie monster restoration once the cookies are over there or banned their monsters.

**[00:36:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do we bring people to see value and want to participate in, you know, participatory learning, you know, hands-on training and also maybe on ramping, you know, less formal and more ways for people to don't go to festivals.

**[00:36:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Don't ask, don't ask.

**[00:36:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'll shut up.

**[00:36:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anyways, that's a question and how could we get the word out to bring more people to some of this training and ecological societies trying to figure out how they can offer continuing education credit CEUs so that students can, you know, into this and see value in their career track.

**[00:37:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> can also see value with their you know with their college you know the degree the credits they get but there may be other ways to bring value that you know I'm not aware of that would bring other people to the table so that's my core question and what why are we stuck to you John.

**[00:37:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting well uh we will we will consider that question momentarily is there more you want to tell us about yourself or any of your specific projects um oh there's so many it's just simply not you know there's there's so much going on so um I can tell you we're the proud parents of the latest red wolf litter that has been born on the planet we a group of us bought 15,000 acres of dewatered ditched coastal north Carolina picosan wetland

**[00:38:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> restore it and now our project is delayed for until mid-June because we have one of the only red wolf litters on the planet that's taken up residency on our this property which is a really wonderful problem to have but you know nothing wrong with delaying the restoration of hydrology in this large acreage for a couple weeks so yeah yeah there's that and then uh we we got invited to albania to look at the coastal well a couple things um our illustrious president and his family walked into albania i don't think he had a direct hand uh and they they basically said we want to do a big resort here but the national park is in the way and they changed the boundary of a dedicated national park

**[00:39:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> give that family access to prime national park land.

**[00:39:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're doing a project with architect Jeanne Gang, Studio Gang in Chicago, a MacArthur fellow that's leveraging a different way to enforce a national reserve.

**[00:39:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're not going to call it a national park.

**[00:39:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So working on a project like that and just a whole bunch of projects.

**[00:39:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Northern Great Plains adaptive multi-pedal grazing study is finding out the same things that we published and you saw in the Soil Carbon Cowboys movie movies or videos.

**[00:39:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> A bunch of so many things.

**[00:39:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's just so exciting.

**[00:39:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Steve, as I understand it, Applied Ecological Services is now a part of RES, whatever that is.

**[00:39:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it still your base of operations or is this?

**[00:39:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> No.

**[00:40:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, I in 2021 I merged applied ecological services about just under 400 staff and 19 offices into REZ and I made a commitment to stand board for two years and after one year the the non-profit work was so exciting and overwhelmingly drawing me that I retired and set up the institute and where I now call home is we my wife and I and four others bought a country club and converted it into a place called the Three Waters Reserve and it's a public a public park that we restored hired the university was constant executive chef and he runs the food and beverage service and so my bit my my office is the basement

**[00:41:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> That used to be the pro shop in the golf course.

**[00:41:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's now a field station for training You know new we call it baby colleges that grow into adult ecologists and my wife Susan Lenhart and others are behind the educational programming and you know foisting that upon the world with wonderful interns that have amazing epiphanies by working in the field of restoration and Measurement and so forth So is this the Institute for Applied Ecology that you're talking about?

**[00:41:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, that it's the applied ecological Institute The Institute can you give us a URL?

**[00:41:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> I got it here.

**[00:41:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> E Institute org.

**[00:41:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah Yeah, I think the Institute for Applied Ecology is in Milbrook New York.

**[00:41:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, it's in Corvallis, Oregon Which is oh, that's right.

**[00:41:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's right.

**[00:41:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay

**[00:42:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, yeah, you know, we have a slogan in the era, we say, what can we all do together that we can't do individually, but and we'll pursue that question in a moment, but you seem to be doing it all individually, although I'm beginning to think that at this point, you've got an army behind you.

**[00:42:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not, it's not as big of a wonderful group of a family of, you know, staff and partners that I used to have.

**[00:42:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's greatly reduced and very focused on a couple of things, although it doesn't sound like it probably is based on what I just told you.

**[00:42:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's based on doing projects on the ground that inform stratifyx, which is the software app, and it's based on doing projects on the ground that that really serve as pilots and demos of take.

**[00:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> on the major challenges.

**[00:43:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's what we're doing.

**[00:43:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> And trying to nail the science and nail the communication and, you know, the art.

**[00:43:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> So Peter Bick, the film producer, working with us, we're working together on the grazing stuff and the on the climate food stuff.

**[00:43:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've got another whole team of communicators that are working on on that and regenerative ag.

**[00:43:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's so many wonderful people.

**[00:43:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not a it's not all under one.

**[00:43:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's it's a wonderful growing team.

**[00:43:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you asked a specific question, which is one that we've been thrashing about ever since we started, which is, how do we somehow get more and more people to understand, you know, that this is this is the most exciting thing about being alive in this particular universe, as far as we know, that

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The future is at stake, and for the coming generation, there's really nothing.

**[00:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's no better prescription for good life than to get on and say, I have the opportunity to save the future.

**[00:44:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But to do that, they have to understand that it's true and that they really can make a difference.

**[00:44:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so how do you get the word out?

**[00:44:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're doing education, I gather, at several different levels.

**[00:44:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I saw that Mike had a comment a bit a few minutes ago.

**[00:44:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Mike, do you want to introduce yourself since you came in a little bit late?

**[00:44:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then also start the discussion about how we can help amplify the kind of work that Steve is doing and that we're all trying to do.

**[00:44:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I apologize.

**[00:44:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> I wasn't following the chat.

**[00:44:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> was trying to...

**[00:44:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, that's okay.

**[00:44:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> If there's questions.

**[00:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys.

**[00:44:56] Mike Lynn**
> No worries.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> Thank you, John.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> I apologize, everybody, for coming in late.

**[00:45:00] Mike Lynn**
> But yeah, you had mentioned you had asked the question is there a way that we could get this in front of other people for continuing education As far as at the academic level, I'm not sure but I know there are institutions that offer Training such as the things like you mentioned Matter of fact, I'm doing one for an organization next month on living shorelines that The people that attend are typically engineers Landscape architects because they come to here for whether it's an hour long to our long full day long And then they get their professional accreditation continuing education hours.

**[00:45:34] Mike Lynn**
> So that might be one avenue.

**[00:45:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's helpful for you to pursue Yeah, we we've been doing that for years with with ASLA and with the the engineering You know groups as well and doing soil bioengineering and the whole range a lot of mine reclamation a lot of river My professor was lonely appalled and river physics and hydrology

**[00:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> been teaching that and but how do you there's so many opportunities how do you build a team around the opportunities and then divide and conquer is what I'm trying to figure out and I've learned a few things you know I thought it was holy as a scientist to get you know 300 people to review a paper and Peter Peter Big it's 600,000 website hits a month on the the the grazing videos now 17 million hits so far in in like 113 countries I can't believe it I mean why do we do science papers why do we write videos seem to be so incredibly you know good interesting yeah so um

**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just want to tag a few future conversations I'd like to have with you and what we shouldn't take at the time.

**[00:47:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have, as you may know, I now know I should send it to you, a project cooking in Panama, where we've said the watershed is a strategic global importance, and that the drought from recent years had such a huge financial impact that it's a really interesting laboratory and demonstration site for trying to show that you can fix climate by fixing ecosystems.

**[00:47:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we're just beginning to get some action on the ground.

**[00:47:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We imagine that when we do that, we're going to have to mobilize lots of people to come up with solutions that better their lives and improve, have measurable impact on local climate and perhaps regional climate.

**[00:47:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it sounds like your software and your expertise might really fit in very well there, so I'll follow up with you on that.

**[00:48:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've done several projects in South America and Costa Rica that have been watershed based restoration projects that we talk about and a bunch of a bunch in North America as well.

**[00:48:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right.

**[00:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The other thing I'll mention is my own answer to the question of how do we engage young people?

**[00:48:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben and I have talked about this a lot.

**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think every school and every university on the planet has got too much pavement, too much parking lots, too much grass, not enough native species.

**[00:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lots and lots of students who are desperate to do something meaningful about the future they're told is coming and probably alumni who would like to give money for a named Miyawaki Forest or another project of that sort.

**[00:48:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would become an outdoor living laboratory and create not just a patch of research.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> stored land, but a cohort of ecosystem restores who know what to do and can fan away from their schools and get it going.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Quaqui Wildcat, one of our ERA members, and I are talking about trying to get something along these lines going, but that recipe, whether it's Miyawaki Forest or some other school-based program, I think should be part of everybody's curriculum.

**[00:49:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I don't know quite a few schools over the years.

**[00:49:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> example, we talked about Seneca Falls a little while ago, John, right in your neighborhood.

**[00:49:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> To do the 1,000-acre Seneca Meadows restoration project around Seneca Falls there, we hired high school students and they collected with us native plant species seeds for prairie wetland savanna.

**[00:50:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a forest from about a about a 30 mile radius.

**[00:50:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then we paid students and we made flats, soil, and seeds available and instructions.

**[00:50:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> And they grew the plants.

**[00:50:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> then for that restoration, we bought plants back with one stipulation that they had to come back with somebody, a relative, a parent, a friend, and plant the plant materials with us.

**[00:50:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And we've done that.

**[00:50:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did that on several mining projects, the Flambeau Mine up in Lady Smith, Wisconsin, and the Jackson County Iron Mine in Black River Falls, starting in the in the mid 80s.

**[00:50:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> And now they're public parks now, these magnificent large landscapes.

**[00:50:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've created durable relationships through that mechanism with the with the community.

**[00:51:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these because now that the families come back to see the plants, they think they planted 20 years ago.

**[00:51:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really wonderful.

**[00:51:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interesting.

**[00:51:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And where are the stories told about these programs that we all agree should be replicated to tools all over the world?

**[00:51:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Seneca Falls story is told in the Audubon Nature Center there at the Seneca Meadows preserve right south of Rochester.

**[00:51:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the stories about Flambomine is told, you can go on the Rio Tinto website, they're so proud of it.

**[00:51:39] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Wisconsin DNR tells the story about those mining projects because instead of planting it with non-native or alfalfa, which is what was originally intended, we planted them with native vegetation, prairies and savanna vegetation, they're fantastic.

**[00:52:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> They just, who are just wildlife areas now, and recreation areas.

**[00:52:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I predict Ben Rubin and I are going to go to the Seneca, what's it called again?

**[00:52:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well it's, it's the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's right on the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> You guys are 45 minutes from there, or something like that.

**[00:52:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is pretty darn close.

**[00:52:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[00:52:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Steve, welcome.

**[00:52:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Steve, it's, it's, it's an amazing, it's work.

**[00:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see you're still going strong.

**[00:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we salute you.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> A couple.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> thank you.

**[00:52:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's an honor.

**[00:52:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, go for it, Natalie.

**[00:52:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, a couple thoughts.

**[00:52:46] Natalie Fleming**
> me, the big change to get, to get people engaged, when you focus on CO2, it's pretty depressing.

**[00:52:52] Natalie Fleming**
> But if, when you focus on the assistive restoration, you can really tie it to breaking the flood drought fire cycle.

**[00:53:01] Natalie Fleming**
> The CO2 focus, CO2 centrism is to me very depressing and slow moving, but eco-restoration is pretty dramatic and powerful.

**[00:53:14] Natalie Fleming**
> There's some fun things that we can do to teach people about climate and ecosystems and, I don't know, to me paragliding.

**[00:53:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I know this sounds crazy, but you talk about peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:25] Natalie Fleming**
> Paragliders, they fly.

**[00:53:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm a pilot.

**[00:53:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> Parasailers, parasailers, they fly and they don't wait for peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:36] Natalie Fleming**
> Right.

**[00:53:37] Natalie Fleming**
> They just get out there and do it and their life depends on understanding microclimates and how the landscape relates to the climate.

**[00:53:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And I do have a picture, I pulled up a slide on where I was down in Utah and they have a spot there, so I didn't actually fly, but they let me play with a kite for a little while.

**[00:53:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Not that crazy yet, but eventually I'll get there.

**[00:54:00] Natalie Fleming**
> I think that focusing on eco restoration over CO2 centrism in the water cycle, focus on the water cycle.

**[00:54:07] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a dramatic difference and it gets people excited because you can make a difference and you can make an immediate change.

**[00:54:13] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's, I think the CO2 is so depressing that people can't get past it and they don't feel like they can really do much about it.

**[00:54:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, we've learned that people are barren by trees because they can see it, see a tree and they don't understand soil carbon.

**[00:54:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's, you know, there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> And there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the soil carbon and all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we've been focusing on is peat and soil carbon projects first and forestry carbons less so.

**[00:54:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I'm a pilot and I'm what's incredible is how violent the winds and the turbulence are now.

**[00:55:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> compared to what they were over the years that I've been flying about 25 or 30 years.

**[00:55:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there are major changes that are occurring that I feel every time I get in the airplane, most every time.

**[00:55:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> So it's very, very frightening to think about flying under some of the conditions that now as a pilot where, you you take off in one place and the prediction isn't quite what it might be projected to be when you're trying to land somewhere.

**[00:55:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[00:55:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant, you have a comment and an observation.

**[00:55:39] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:55:41] sustainavistas**
> I think if we look at the process, mean, first it's not really trees or soil or carbon.

**[00:55:48] sustainavistas**
> I think we're generally talking about changing behavior.

**[00:55:54] sustainavistas**
> And something I'd like to point to, I think Joe has probably a time for us to maybe

**[00:56:00] sustainavistas**
> for me to jump on on and give an update, because we've, so see, we are the founder of my ecological founder of our group, Courtney of Balmeneu, which is more trees now in Dutch, started 14 years ago by himself for about the first five years, challenging the local council.

**[00:56:18] sustainavistas**
> So we just outside Amsterdam Schupper Airport in probably one of the densest population urban areas.

**[00:56:26] sustainavistas**
> And in the Netherlands it started with removing 1000 school tiles and putting, rescuing one tree from a local urban forest and planting that on a thousand schools plains.

**[00:56:39] sustainavistas**
> And that went on for five years and we've now 14 years grown into an organization that's saved, rescued and donated and transplanted in the Netherlands over three million free trees, siblings.

**[00:56:52] sustainavistas**
> 30,000 volunteers and we're now going to six countries, so Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland and France, which is

**[00:57:00] sustainavistas**
> last year started a kit of a project with five ecosystem registration communities of John D.

**[00:57:05] sustainavistas**
> Liu in Ireland, sort of Cree, in Vericelle, in France, Recoviva, in Italy, in Spain, we've just come back from Altiplana and also the EFC headquarters and then obviously we're in Dutch base, so we're spending two years developing training and education materials for that.

**[00:57:27] sustainavistas**
> But if you look at what we're doing, I really think we're probably the first organisation, there's one group in France and I'll correct me if I'm wrong in Australia or the USA or Canada or any other countries that they're doing it, but we basically use nature as a nursery and basically because we use 50 centimetre to two metre high trees, that's like our sweet spot, we can do bigger trees, but that's our sweet spot and these are five to 20-year-old settings, so we really

**[00:58:00] sustainavistas**
> starting with a far better base and then in the temperate north we actually rescue and save and our survival rate is 70 to 80 percent so and it's a free resource so we do about 150 species in the Netherlands and I think that so twice it's really mass participation of communities connecting people to nature and showing them an ecological solution as well as people can actually really scale so I mean this is probably one of the most incredible scalable solutions that's and and and so we would love people we if you look at our more trees now dot eco website we've got a whole communication toolkit we show our manuals our hands everything we've translated four languages but also we give it all away for nothing so have a look at that and I think it could be interesting to use that because if you can I mean we in the winter in our little area near airport skipway airport our biggest tree have we risked 140 000 trees and gave them away for free if we and that's any

> every day, every day for six months, 10, 20 year volunteers working on it, but if we got paid people, we got thousands of people to do this, and we could do it in 20 or 30 countries, we basically could really ramp up the carbon sequestration, but also change behavior, basically, and really.

**[00:59:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:59:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Grant, you have reminded me that it is indeed time for an update from you.

**[00:59:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll follow up for a report.

**[00:59:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you're right.

**[00:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You have a solution which has scaled and rallied tens of thousands of people.

**[00:59:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We really are in a planet with 8 billion.

**[00:59:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let's see how we can scale that up and then we spread the word.

**[00:59:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> think replicable models is really what we're all looking for in transferability to other systems.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yep.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Exactly.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you.

**[00:59:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you're in the Netherlands.

**[00:59:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> Did I hear that right?

**[00:59:56] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:57] sustainavistas**
> I'm actually looking...

**[01:00:00] sustainavistas**
> My son is, I'm actually in Canada, Quebec for a week, I'm actually looking at starting some trials up in Canada because I've just become a grandparent, so we'll be coming to Canada two or three times a year probably.

**[01:00:12] sustainavistas**
> So our first grandchild was just born in Montreal 19 days ago, so yeah, so I'm actually on a 20 hectare property, so I think this might be one of the first treehouses in Canada.

**[01:00:26] sustainavistas**
> So yeah, let's not take too much more time, but I think let's have a conversation in parallel.

**[01:00:37] sustainavistas**
> One other quick question to the group in order to join, do you know any members that are going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:47] sustainavistas**
> No, I do not.

**[01:00:48] sustainavistas**
> Okay, I'll put that in the email tomorrow, but if you can't follow that, it's probably often New York and London climate week is probably one of the highest profiles, about 40,000.

**[01:01:00] sustainavistas**
> And people go to Paris for three days and it's a really an epic event and a lot of submissions that got a lot of those solutions there and ecosystem restoration is a real big, okay, thanks guys.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thank you, Brett.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, great.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> It sounds like a way to think about transferability of the, you know, the, the.

**[01:01:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> How you change the behavior and less so what you're planning and unless that's critical, but to work across different ecosystems, that'd be great.

**[01:01:32] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, exactly.

**[01:01:33] sustainavistas**
> I mean, for example, one of the small projects, sorry, John, just we start, we kicked off this year, we did an eco fitness.

**[01:01:38] sustainavistas**
> So basically, not only working on the ecological fitness of the forest and the land, but we also work on the fitness and the health and mental fitness people at the same time.

**[01:01:47] sustainavistas**
> So we kick sort of that off this year.

**[01:01:49] sustainavistas**
> So there's some videos on that.

**[01:01:50] sustainavistas**
> That's why it was a bit of fun, but actually we have to pick it up.

**[01:01:53] sustainavistas**
> So we work from November to March for the trees at the moment.

**[01:01:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's basically our model.

**[01:01:57] sustainavistas**
> That's great.

**[01:01:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:01:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:02:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie, you just switched off your camera, but I'm hoping this is your moment to give us your presentation.

**[01:02:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, my friend just came out to see if I wanted some chicken that's a little bit too spicy for me.

**[01:02:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And to see if the kids in the dog can come out and play.

**[01:02:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, did you just say you wanted me to do the presentation now?

**[01:02:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I did.

**[01:02:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I did.

**[01:02:22] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, hopefully I don't start coughing like a crazy one.

**[01:02:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:02:27] Natalie Fleming**
> So, if you've followed me at all on LinkedIn, you know that I obsessed about the water cycle.

**[01:02:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think all problems I'll call every all the problems and ecosystems are caused by bare grounds and bare ground and lack of life.

**[01:02:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I blame everything on the desert and I blame everything on mineral dust just so you know just about.

**[01:02:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I had the opportunity to spend the winter in Salt Lake and it was pretty exciting for me to go back to Salt Lake.

**[01:02:58] Natalie Fleming**
> It is kind of the land of my children.

**[01:03:00] Natalie Fleming**
> sensitivity.

**[01:03:02] Natalie Fleming**
> When I started out in life, lived in the Utah Valley along the Wasatch Front.

**[01:03:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And if you've been paying attention, they have a terrible crisis now where they have the great drought.

**[01:03:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I first got down there in October, I was able to stay on Mount Olympus.

**[01:03:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Olympus looking over the valley and it was absolutely beautiful.

**[01:03:29] Natalie Fleming**
> This picture right here is from there.

**[01:03:32] Natalie Fleming**
> on the mountain side, it has a beautiful forest on the mountain side.

**[01:03:39] Natalie Fleming**
> If you're not familiar with the landscaping of the Great Salt Lake, you've got, as the winds come in from the west, you've got a lot of bare ground.

**[01:03:48] Natalie Fleming**
> You have the salt flats, you have the Great Salt Lake, and then you have these massive huge, I should have written down the exact height of the mountains and to Mount Tipinogus and all these Mount Olympus, they're huge.

**[01:04:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or gargantuan.

**[01:04:02] Natalie Fleming**
> And these mountains are amazing because they really trap in, they have the potential to trap in the moisture.

**[01:04:09] Natalie Fleming**
> But they have been denuding and ripping landscaping and plants out over the last 20 or 30 years.

**[01:04:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I was there 30 years ago, there were orchards and lawns and conifers and deciduous.

**[01:04:27] Natalie Fleming**
> There were all manner of life was there.

**[01:04:30] Natalie Fleming**
> And because the community is trapped between the mountain and the lake, there's very little room for growth.

**[01:04:38] Natalie Fleming**
> And so they've been denuding it.

**[01:04:41] Natalie Fleming**
> as strangely, the rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Thanks.

**[01:04:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I'm going to try this chicken in a minute.

**[01:04:49] Natalie Fleming**
> The rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:52] Natalie Fleming**
> so the solution was to denude the earth some more and rip out more trees and grasses and shrubs.

**[01:04:58] Natalie Fleming**
> And after a minute,

**[01:05:00] Natalie Fleming**
> official of the neighbors.

**[01:05:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, those are some domesticated teenagers.

**[01:05:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Just a second here.

**[01:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're not hearing much of your background.

**[01:05:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, I can hear it.

**[01:05:19] Natalie Fleming**
> I was screaming at him.

**[01:05:22] Natalie Fleming**
> It's a subdivision here.

**[01:05:24] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a full neighborhood going on.

**[01:05:26] Natalie Fleming**
> So they've been denuding the earth and ripping out landscaping and trees.

**[01:05:31] Natalie Fleming**
> The cities have been paying people to rip out vegetation in order to save the water.

**[01:05:40] Natalie Fleming**
> The Great Salt Lake strike team, and their plan to save the lake is to direct all water from the watershed directly to the lake and skip any vegetation in the landscape along the way.

**[01:05:55] Natalie Fleming**
> So I found out three hours ago I'd be doing this presentation.

**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So can I can I share?

**[01:06:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes please.

**[01:06:03] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay so um desktop one you're going to see all my stuff here all the kids um here is a video I wasn't able to export this video to the right format so uh this is the rocks that they are landscaping with now there used to be vegetation here and ripped it out in order to not use water their focus is is stopping water usage they don't understand the water cycle not used so they put in this rock landscaping and you can hear the highway this is the landscaping that they've put in and while I was driving around the valley I would stop and take pictures and videos as I went along and I was just horrified so you see these rocks we see the tree above ahead um this is a you know you're looking at a quarter mile of rocks and as I step into the trees you're going to see what they ripped out to save water

**[01:07:01] Natalie Fleming**
> And you're going to see, you know, six foot tall grasses, trees, shrubs, and a little small riparian area.

**[01:07:08] Natalie Fleming**
> I had the sound on, you would hear the birds chirping.

**[01:07:12] Natalie Fleming**
> And this whole area is next to the lake.

**[01:07:16] Natalie Fleming**
> It's between the lake and Jordan River.

**[01:07:18] Natalie Fleming**
> And they ripped down all this vegetation.

**[01:07:21] Natalie Fleming**
> And I have videos of the machines continuing to rip out more and more vegetation.

**[01:07:25] Natalie Fleming**
> There is very little of this left.

**[01:07:29] Natalie Fleming**
> So this is, of course, a month ago.

**[01:07:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So the spring hasn't come yet.

**[01:07:33] Natalie Fleming**
> I should probably go back in a month when it's all green.

**[01:07:38] Natalie Fleming**
> But they've just ripped this all out and the soil was rich and thick and soft and moist.

**[01:07:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And these are the tall pompous grass that they have.

**[01:07:47] Natalie Fleming**
> And they're ripping this out to save the water and to conserve water, because this is obviously using water.

**[01:07:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And they don't even understand that water is not used, water is cycled.

**[01:08:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, um, it's pretty horrific.

**[01:08:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, sorry, let's put that over here.

**[01:08:05] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Let's see.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> How are we going to go to slide show, uh, please start.

**[01:08:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:13] Natalie Fleming**
> So I threw this together real quick.

**[01:08:15] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, there's a picture.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> The great.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it is a shrunk exponentially.

**[01:08:21] Natalie Fleming**
> How do I go to the next?

**[01:08:23] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, I gotta move you guys over where I can't see you anymore.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> I think.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> Because you're, I can't say anything.

**[01:08:30] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, there we go.

**[01:08:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's in the 1980s.

**[01:08:33] Natalie Fleming**
> was about 3000 square miles.

**[01:08:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And now it's down to 150.

**[01:08:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's down to less than a third of what it was before.

**[01:08:40] Natalie Fleming**
> And as the lake shrinks, um, they've got some serious problems.

**[01:08:48] Natalie Fleming**
> One of the next to the lake, this is I, I am LDS and we build chapels everywhere and under advisement of the local community.

**[01:08:57] Natalie Fleming**
> They were advised to landscape in this manner.

**[01:09:00] Natalie Fleming**
> To use rocks and I compare using rocks as landscaping as using skulls and bones to landscape rocks are the are the skull.

**[01:09:08] Natalie Fleming**
> They're the structure of the earth and the soil and the trees.

**[01:09:12] Natalie Fleming**
> That is the flesh of the earth.

**[01:09:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So imagine just ripping the flesh off of your arm, which is grotesque and expecting the blood to flow and it's not flowing.

**[01:09:20] Natalie Fleming**
> So we know from Zach wise and water stories about Lancaster and all these wonderful people that you're supposed to sink slow and spread the water and then get as much vegetation as you can out of it to get the body pump going.

**[01:09:33] Natalie Fleming**
> And as you can see this particular structure, they've done the opposite.

**[01:09:38] Natalie Fleming**
> The tall this next right next to this was seven foot tall pompous grass that was ripped out and this is right.

**[01:09:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is Lakefront property.

**[01:09:46] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was water conservation gone wrong.

**[01:09:50] Natalie Fleming**
> If we do not have plants, you're not going to have rain.

**[01:09:54] Natalie Fleming**
> lot of people think the plants come because of the rain, but it's just like the chicken and the egg.

**[01:10:00] Natalie Fleming**
> to have vegetation and plants and great soil to keep the biotic pump going.

**[01:10:04] Natalie Fleming**
> I need to explain the bi...

**[01:10:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I can't let me put you back up there.

**[01:10:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I don't think you do actually.

**[01:10:09] Natalie Fleming**
> I do it.

**[01:10:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Everybody here gets it.

**[01:10:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[01:10:11] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:10:12] Natalie Fleming**
> can skip, so I don't have to explain the biotic pump.

**[01:10:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I can do that, but I think you guys are all versed in it.

**[01:10:19] Natalie Fleming**
> So the water cycle is completely biological in line out.

**[01:10:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And it's transpiration as an engine.

**[01:10:27] Natalie Fleming**
> so you all know about Pseudonose, Miserengi, and other mushroom spores and pollens that cloud seed at warm temperatures.

**[01:10:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So I don't need to explain that to you.

**[01:10:38] Natalie Fleming**
> So all of this, you already know?

**[01:10:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I think we are, we're here because we all share the same basic understanding.

**[01:10:48] Natalie Fleming**
> So here is the view from the place I was initially staying at.

**[01:10:51] Natalie Fleming**
> it's just beautiful, these mountains, and there's a great biodiversity of trees.

**[01:10:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And my plan for the Great Salt Lake would be to harvest all of the seeds,

**[01:11:00] Natalie Fleming**
> on this and set up nurseries and the mountains on the other side of the valley are barren.

**[01:11:06] Natalie Fleming**
> And so if we took the trees and expanded the forestry system, but they're cutting down trees, they're cutting down conifers because they all use water.

**[01:11:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it was very heartbreaking to see.

**[01:11:20] Natalie Fleming**
> the ancient Amazonians, they used the mountains to their advantage to trap in the as the clouds came in, as the moisture came in, they created water retention landscapes and built structures to really maximize vegetation and trap the water in.

**[01:11:35] Natalie Fleming**
> the Great Salt Lake in the Wasatch Front, that area has a great advantage with that great mountain that could trap in an incredible amount of water.

**[01:11:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is what I saw everywhere where by mandate the trees, the homes were built with rock landscaping, which to me is kind of like Terminator where they're walking on the skulls.

**[01:11:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the bones of the earth.

**[01:12:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Can you explain to you how and why?

**[01:12:02] Natalie Fleming**
> they're just directoring all vegetation over.

**[01:12:05] Natalie Fleming**
> then the lake has the lake bed because it does not drain anywhere else.

**[01:12:12] Natalie Fleming**
> It has a lot of arsenic lead in mercury and selenium that as it dries out, it's kicking that dust.

**[01:12:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And the ice nucleating temperatures of that dust, meaning its rainfall potential is very, very low.

**[01:12:25] Natalie Fleming**
> It has to be super, super, super cold in order for it to stimulate rainfall.

**[01:12:28] Natalie Fleming**
> So that's super bad.

**[01:12:32] Natalie Fleming**
> It was super depressing for me to see this because when I left, there were orchards and herds and all sorts of things.

**[01:12:38] Natalie Fleming**
> this unleashing pollutants, there's a health crisis because of the asthma and heart disease.

**[01:12:43] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got arsenic in the air.

**[01:12:46] Natalie Fleming**
> They've convinced a lot of local farmers to redirect water from the farm to the lake.

**[01:12:53] Natalie Fleming**
> And they think it's gonna help.

**[01:12:54] Natalie Fleming**
> So you already know what temperature, okay, don't need to give you that.

**[01:12:59] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:13:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, this is a view, a picture I took this winter when the snow was there and you can see that from the side of the mountain, you can see the clouds forming and rumbling on this side.

**[01:13:12] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on that.

**[01:13:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on any of this.

**[01:13:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So, on the right is a picture of what I, I took both these pictures.

**[01:13:22] Natalie Fleming**
> These were side by side.

**[01:13:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And on the right, this is along a riverbed, the Jordan River.

**[01:13:28] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping out massive amounts.

**[01:13:30] Natalie Fleming**
> I could show you the whole video of them piling up the dirt and shipping it off and then saying, we're having a drought.

**[01:13:36] Natalie Fleming**
> I just don't know why.

**[01:13:37] Natalie Fleming**
> if they, yeah, I don't know the polite way to tell them they're all stupid.

**[01:13:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> Natalie, did you see any good examples of landscaping that might be nothing at all?

**[01:13:53] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping everything out that they consider the rock landscaping is good.

**[01:13:57] Natalie Fleming**
> This right here.

**[01:13:58] Natalie Fleming**
> This isn't Saratoga Springs.

**[01:14:00] Natalie Fleming**
> If you look closely, those are logs.

**[01:14:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the only trees I found in that area when I was driving all of that particular area.

**[01:14:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the logs.

**[01:14:10] Natalie Fleming**
> They were building new subdivisions.

**[01:14:11] Natalie Fleming**
> They're building massive, massive subdivisions and they obviously they cut down some tree.

**[01:14:17] Natalie Fleming**
> But the focus is that that uses water.

**[01:14:20] Natalie Fleming**
> They're really obsessed with removing anything that uses water.

**[01:14:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Natalie, do you talk, do you give this presentation in Salt Lake City?

**[01:14:33] Natalie Fleming**
> No, I made this presentation an hour ago for tonight.

**[01:14:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you?

**[01:14:38] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact these people.

**[01:14:40] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email address.

**[01:14:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact Brian Stede.

**[01:14:43] Natalie Fleming**
> He is at the University of Utah.

**[01:14:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I got a really good reference person, really top notch person.

**[01:14:49] Natalie Fleming**
> He me the reference.

**[01:14:50] Natalie Fleming**
> He didn't really return the calls.

**[01:14:52] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email addresses of everybody on the right team.

**[01:14:55] Natalie Fleming**
> everybody, I don't know how to approach them without being a jerk, really, without telling them they're.

**[01:15:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Scrooming things up because who am I and they're hydrologists and geologists and all these.

**[01:15:05] Natalie Fleming**
> These are university hydrologists, but PhDs and post PhDs and teach at the university and who am I to go and tell them they're.

**[01:15:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> You know, the, the LDS church, we worked on the city creek.

**[01:15:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, the, uh, the mall, we were the folks that brought.

**[01:15:22] SteveApfelbaum**
> Uh, city creek to the surface that runs to the mall.

**[01:16:27] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, maybe you can help me if you have the contacts.

**[01:16:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Send me an email and I'll see if the contacts are still viable.

**[01:16:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because we worked with them for six or seven years.

**[01:16:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I lived in Roosevelt, Utah and became very close with leaders in the church.

**[01:16:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because there's so many Jack Mormons and Roosevelt, they were afraid they were going to lose the tribe out there.

**[01:16:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So he even went after little Jewish boys like me to indoctrinate us.

**[01:17:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Just so you know, Jack Mormons are Mormons that don't quite abide.

**[01:17:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> No, I know that.

**[01:17:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I know that.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Oh, I know.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:17:09] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> I know what a Jack Mormon is.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> You're from the mountainside.

**[01:17:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So when I was there for the first month, I didn't understand why the lake was shrinking because I didn't actually go through the valley the first month.

**[01:17:20] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I've got some great shots.

**[01:17:21] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was good.

**[01:17:24] Natalie Fleming**
> The landowner actually wanted to clear something.

**[01:17:25] Natalie Fleming**
> So you can see a lot of bare ground that here with this forest, the mountain sides don't have many trees over there.

**[01:17:32] Natalie Fleming**
> And there were certain sides that had more trees.

**[01:17:35] Natalie Fleming**
> So these are the beautiful views that I got to see.

**[01:17:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I guess that's the end of that.

**[01:17:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> And those are big fire scars.

**[01:17:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those aren't from logging.

**[01:17:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those are wildfire scars from the early 20s and 1910.

**[01:17:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did the master plan for the open space system for Salt Lake City.

**[01:17:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's really interesting how fires played a big role.

**[01:17:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ranching and early fires.

**[01:18:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, if, if I'll send you my information, if you can help in there, there's several different, I could tell you all the stories of all the ways I tried to get in and try to reach the right people.

**[01:18:12] Natalie Fleming**
> But I do have the list of email address of everybody on the great Salt Lake strike team, but I have hesitated to email them because who is Natalie Fleming to go in and tell them.

**[01:18:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Natalie Fleming is now acquainted with Steve Applebaum, who it turns out has got roots in the area.

**[01:18:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if it is Natalie's diagnosis, roughly correct that they're doing almost exactly the wrong thing if they want to turn this around.

**[01:18:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're desertifying the area and not building capacity for water retention and for in the soil system and for lagging the runoff, the hydrograph.

**[01:18:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everything's running off the land so quickly.

**[01:18:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So yeah, it's the right, it's the right thing, but the church isn't easy to do.

> to unless you get to the for-profit arm because they're paying for a lot of these problems.

**[01:19:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're, you know, the community suffering, the erosion and infrastructure damages are really significantly expensive.

**[01:19:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So I'm pretty distressed because at church they announced that they're going to do this great program to reduce vegetation on all the churches across the world and I want to go to them.

**[01:19:23] Natalie Fleming**
> I know they're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do this and I'm like who do I tell them that because Brigham Young taught us we're supposed to make the earth as a garden of Eden not Mars and that picture there of everything's going dark on me all of a sudden.

**[01:19:40] Natalie Fleming**
> That picture is, it looks like you're looking for the rover on it.

**[01:19:45] Natalie Fleming**
> It's so bad and I really want to sit down with them and say they're going to spend hundreds of millions possibly a billion dollars to do massive eco-destruction believing they're doing the right thing.

**[01:20:09] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Well, wow, what a great presentation.

**[01:20:12] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> thank you so much for what you're doing and a couple things.

**[01:20:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> One, in terms of who is Natalie Fleming, you may have to go to small groups of people and spread your story.

**[01:20:24] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And then Natalie Fleming will be someone with 100 angry citizens behind her.

**[01:20:28] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> That makes a big difference in whether city officials will listen.

**[01:20:33] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> the main thing I want to mention is when you mentioned the rains disappearing and as he described that situation, I was hearing me on over and over.

**[01:20:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Nicely, the situation he described.

**[01:20:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> He talked about the carrier component and the trigger component.

**[01:20:53] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And the carrier component is the moisture that comes in from a larger system.

**[01:20:58] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Mediterranean sea in the case of Mediterranean sea.

**[01:21:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> But it sounds like it's the sea in Salt Lake.

**[01:21:07] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> It's Salt Lake that's providing the moisture, and then you have the trigger, which is the vegetation.

**[01:21:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So they're reproducing the desertification, as Steve said, but in a particular way, very similar to what Mian was talking about.

**[01:21:26] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And, of course, it was always kind of assumed that he was referring to situations in Mediterranean climate, and they tended to be coastal situations, but this points to this happening in any kind of climate, and inland.

**[01:21:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So, yeah, my mind is kind of blowing up.

**[01:21:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> This is amazing what you're doing, and never doubt yourself.

**[01:21:54] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> I mean, who is Natalie Fleming?

**[01:21:56] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> She's this amazing woman who has figured all this stuff out.

**[01:22:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**

**[01:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I think he's right, Natalie, you mentioned today that you're thinking about politics, but I actually think that your best path to politics might well be to really say, this is who Natalie Fleming is on this topic.

**[01:22:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's only going to become more and more clear that you were right and that you had the courage to say it.

**[01:22:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it actually, I think, would give you a very distinctive brand as a politician if you led with that.

**[01:22:41] Natalie Fleming**
> And this form of environmentalism is agreeable to both sides, both the left and the right politically.

**[01:22:49] Natalie Fleming**
> But one exciting thing for me is if we can get the LDS church on board is that LDS church has properties all over the world and they have a missionary mindset and they have missionaries all over the world.

**[01:23:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, and the missionaries are required to put it in a certain number of hours of service in their community, wherever they are.

**[01:23:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And that is non, non, across the lighting service.

**[01:23:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:23:10] Natalie Fleming**
> And so, getting these youth, getting the youth trained before they go on emissions on this stuff.

**[01:23:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:23:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:23:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:25:10] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anything that doesn't have the reflectivity, the albedo and the heating capacity and the imperviousness that they're creating would be better and unfortunately lawn is better than what they're doing, but it's not much better.

**[01:25:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> But yeah, we could talk about that further.

**[01:25:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've written a couple of papers on the role of landscapes in water management that might be useful.

**[01:25:43] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> 400 times over historic low flows and the displaying the river in the Chicago region, median flows have increased if I recall about 250 times on average over historic flows and the high flow events are three to five times the historic high flow flood events.

**[01:26:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's in a paper we did with Leopold.

**[01:26:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we're doing is we've flip-flopped the hydrology at the watershed scale from a groundwater recharge and infiltration and very long lag time.

**[01:26:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> The lag is the time period between the center of the mass of the rainfall distribution, the center of the mass of the runoff distribution hydrograph.

**[01:26:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've converted recharge-based systems into surface runoff based systems and it's every urban watershed.

**[01:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's very few that that hasn't happened to, and virtually every agricultural watershed, the same thing has happened.

**[01:27:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the story is very well understood, but what's not understood in urban areas, at least in the West, in Salt Lake, a lot of the people there are new customers, and they're interested in high dollar houses with minimal landscaping.

**[01:27:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's part of what the Netflix owner at Big Powder Mountain wants to get across to the people moving into these 20 million dollar homes.

**[01:27:41] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, one of the things that set me is that the church in good faith has donated hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water to go from the farmland to skip the farmland and go direct to the lake.

**[01:28:18] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:28:20] SteveApfelbaum**

> So it's nice to sort of have those as bookends.

**[01:35:50] Ben Rubin**
> just to give a small window into what's outside my window.

**[01:35:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the cherry tree.

**[01:35:59] Ben Rubin**
> One of the things.

**[01:36:00] Ben Rubin**
> is that is is a big focus for me.

**[01:36:02] Ben Rubin**
> I teach K through 12.

**[01:36:04] Ben Rubin**
> So, you know, my day is kind of this developmental bender of starting out with five year olds and ending with, you know, sometimes 21 year olds.

**[01:36:13] Ben Rubin**
> I've been looking at, let's see, I can share some of this.

**[01:36:17] Ben Rubin**
> I keep the sketchbook.

**[01:36:19] Ben Rubin**
> That's kind of my main artistic practice.

**[01:36:22] Ben Rubin**
> are some sketchbook notes that I've taken doing different educational programs here in upstate New York.

**[01:36:32] Ben Rubin**
> The students also, I think, really benefit from that practice.

**[01:36:38] Ben Rubin**
> So, we bind sketchbooks.

**[01:36:40] Ben Rubin**
> We use tetrapack containers, which are just recycled mill cartons, you know, K through 12.

**[01:36:46] Ben Rubin**
> The students are involved with, you know, binding these books and then learn, you know, practices for journaling.

**[01:36:56] Ben Rubin**
> I think what's really exciting is

**[01:37:00] Ben Rubin**
> look at how to take some of this stuff outside.

**[01:37:02] Ben Rubin**
> we've done a little bit of that.

**[01:37:04] Ben Rubin**
> Again, these are some of my sketchbooks, in terms of the classroom, you know, just sharing some different ideas that I've had using recycled materials and journaling to kids outside.

**[01:37:25] Ben Rubin**
> This is actually the Cornell webcam with birds.

**[01:37:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's something that we use often in the classroom.

**[01:37:36] Ben Rubin**
> You know, sort of rambling, but yeah, that's really it.

**[01:37:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> What Ben, what did the kids gravitate toward when you take them outside?

**[01:37:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Is there anything that they're really drawn to?

**[01:37:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> it activity like a bird that flies into the view?

**[01:37:55] Ben Rubin**
> What draws them?

**[01:37:57] Ben Rubin**
> You know, being able to take

**[01:38:00] Ben Rubin**
> things or trace things.

**[01:38:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, hands-on stuff, of course.

**[01:38:06] Ben Rubin**
> I feel like just being outside is, they're inside all day.

**[01:38:14] Ben Rubin**
> Public school is really just marching from one room to the other and sometimes just being able to get a sense of where the sun is in the sky and spending a half an hour outside makes a big difference.

**[01:38:29] Ben Rubin**
> It's this little wall up courtyard.

**[01:38:31] Ben Rubin**
> The school was built by Italian immigrants or it was started with an Italian community a long time ago.

**[01:38:40] Ben Rubin**
> So there's some of this stuff.

**[01:38:41] Ben Rubin**
> There's the figs and the cherries that are from previous generations that most of it is just weeds.

**[01:38:55] Natalie Fleming**
> What I find exciting about your work is

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think something inherent in all of us that about growing food, that that basic thing that we have power over gives you a sense of power for the rest of your life.

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**
> But there's also a sort of a project inspired by that book with these postcards of people from around the world writing messages to, you know, basically migrating peoples.

**[01:40:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned Ben, school is Rochester International Academy.

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is a sanctuary city, controversially this year, of course, and the population is very diverse and includes brand new immigrants, some of them from Afghanistan who incidentally Ben helped bring to Rochester.

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

> This form is basically untested, and see if you can put some information in it, and then I'll know if it works because I'm going be sending it to everybody in the ERA, all four to five hundred of us.

**[00:24:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:24:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First guest and speaker and soon-to-be ERA member is Steve Apfelbaum, a book of whose I have in my living room, and I started quite some time ago when I heard about him through Bio4Climate, and apparently the author of many books with more to come.

**[00:24:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Steve, give us your story, please.

**[00:24:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well, where do I start?

**[00:25:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, as a young child, nature was my passion, my bliss, uh, rehabilitating injured and raising baby animals was, uh, I did and was on a veterinary medicine tract to work with wild animals and, uh, and in vet school and a professor said, Hey, you love canoeing in wilderness.

**[00:25:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's a grant to do some research in a wilderness area.

**[00:25:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I said, Oh, wow, you mean like not having to take care of dogs and city cats?

**[00:25:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it turned out we got the grant and spent basically fast forward 40 years of staying the fire ecology of the boundary water, wilderness, and Quedicope Provincial Park couldn't be

**[00:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Northeastern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario and basically went on to graduate school as a result of that opportunity.

**[00:26:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> And my whole life has been focused on studying the healthiest ecosystems on the planet, measuring biodiversity, a whole range of functions, publishing technical articles, learning what we can from those systems and then emulating that and bringing that into design in urban systems and rural systems.

**[00:26:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So learning from caribou and bison and working with grazing systems, the soil carbon cowboy series that you may or may not have heard about, that's our work with Alan Williams and Gabe Brown.

**[00:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a whole bunch of people.

**[00:27:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now we've worked on about 100 million acres bringing improved grazing and provided the science and are continuing to expand on the climate mitigation opportunities and the biodiversity mitigation opportunities.

**[00:27:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That introduced me to the need for translating the science into market language.

**[00:27:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We put together in 2009 with Ratan Lal and a number of the top soil scientists on the planet, a carbon measurement protocol that became a global standard.

**[00:27:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Vera published it as VM0021.

**[00:27:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've subsequently converted that into a family of standards called the Regenerative Standard.

**[00:27:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> And last year alone, we have with project developers

**[00:28:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for about a million acres of improved grazing in North America and were on a track to hit 20 to 30 million acres in five or six years.

**[00:28:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> One of the things that we learned during the process of trying to work at landscape scales and get the science right and get the policy right and get the market right and get the trust and transparency right, was that there was no way to ecological literacy across any of those subjects.

**[00:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we spun out a company.

**[00:28:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> I retired from my company, Applied Ecological Services, about in 2021 and spun up a non-profit called Applied Ecological Institute.

**[00:28:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm Wisconsin based, Katie.

**[00:28:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're in southern Wisconsin.

**[00:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these heads.

**[00:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that organization has started a new company called Stratifix, which is a subscriber SaaS-based business that is basically bringing 200 or more datasets and mapping capabilities to any piece of land in the U.S.

**[00:29:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> currently and North America, less detailed.

**[00:29:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> But you can look at any piece of property.

**[00:29:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll immediately have the land ownership and all sorts of other amazing data, assessed value, value of improvements.

**[00:29:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then there's nearly 200 natural resource datasets that you can apply to that property.

**[00:29:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can do scenario planning for evaluating different land uses, whether it be restoration,

**[00:30:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for agricultural practices, adapt to multi-pedic grazing versus continuous conventional no-till versus whatever pillage.

**[00:30:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can evaluate different crops.

**[00:30:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you could do highest and best value optimization using actual real-time spot pricing for the commodities and all the NASS USDA data sets with the average soil yields and the economics for every county in the US.

**[00:30:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So that's spun up and that's really helping us do restoration at scale, including we used it to do about a billion and a half acre prioritization of all the grassland restoration opportunities in North America.

**[00:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's now being used by the voluntary carbon market by a number of players to go out and secure.

**[00:31:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or the landowner partnering relationships to do the improved grazing.

**[00:31:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a lot of that stuff that I've been working on.

**[00:31:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Education is kind of what brought me to contact you, John.

**[00:31:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> I've been teaching for about 12 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, co-teaching a class on the future of coastal ecosystems on the planet.

**[00:31:26] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then with COVID, I kind of retired from that job because it was no fun teaching over Zoom.

**[00:31:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, the personal relationships and the field work with the students is what really kind of made everything work well.

**[00:31:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> But there's an incredible unmet demand for bringing ecosystem restoration to not just the landowners that may have no technical training and what they want is, you know, how to

**[00:32:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do I do this?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do first?

**[00:32:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> What's it going to cost?

**[00:32:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> What are the downsides?

**[00:32:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, what are my decisions and how significant are they or can I grow into it lightly and kind of learn along the route?

**[00:32:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what I've proposed to the ecological society is a series of two-hour primers which I've already been teaching.

**[00:32:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> I did two of them in the past month with them and then a six or a 12-hour online class and then one week classes in the field in various places around the starting here in Wisconsin, southern Wisconsin.

**[00:32:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> we're doing huge coastal restorations in North Carolina right now.

**[00:32:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're doing huge projects, setting up a very large project in Alabama.

**[00:33:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've worked throughout the Americas, Central and South America.

**[00:33:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's all sorts of opportunities in different geographies to leverage those different geographies for training and really building a capacity to take restoration as a primary nature-based solution package to climate and water and biodiversity and food.

**[00:33:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> And, you know, also nutrition, all this to civilization, basically.

**[00:33:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> So I've been trying to work on that and what AEI is spending out our solutions and education around some of our biggest challenges.

**[00:33:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> Climate being one, biodiversity being another food, nutritional density and, you know, we can go on and on and on.

**[00:33:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a bunch of other things.

**[00:33:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We started a new food company.

**[00:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> me with the former chairman of Whole Foods, who was the chairman for 23 years, called the Client Food Company, that's focused on not just perennializing agriculture, but using long, long-used and traditional native foods that nobody pays attention to unless it's prepared right and then you ask, what the hell is this?

**[00:34:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're commercializing.

**[00:34:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We have FDA approval for human consumption of two native perigraphs, grains, and the nutritional value, this is a reference for genuine wild rye, almost for genitus, 23 to 28 percent digestible protein, incredibly well-balanced macro and micronutrient profiles, taste profiles, which I can't taste the difference, but the chefs that we've hired can

**[00:35:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> you know say things that I never quite understand but we're introducing that into a cookie line that may be at Whole Foods and we've just released a new cookie an old cookie that was the very famous cookie here in Madison Wisconsin called the gorilla cookie and soon we'll be introducing Virginia Wilder I flower into that cookie so Katie if you if you happen down into Madison gonna go to the Willy Street co-op and get gorilla cookies which was the anti-war protester cookie of choice in the 60s Vietnam War and now it's introduced the original recipe that was lost in time and nearly extinct never said that about a cookie so I think I think you know one of the questions I had is how do we bring non-science people to

**[00:36:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> recognize value in a cookie, cookie monster restoration once the cookies are over there or banned their monsters.

**[00:36:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do we bring people to see value and want to participate in, you know, participatory learning, you know, hands-on training and also maybe on ramping, you know, less formal and more ways for people to don't go to festivals.

**[00:36:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Don't ask, don't ask.

**[00:36:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'll shut up.

**[00:36:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anyways, that's a question and how could we get the word out to bring more people to some of this training and ecological societies trying to figure out how they can offer continuing education credit CEUs so that students can, you know, into this and see value in their career track.

**[00:37:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> can also see value with their you know with their college you know the degree the credits they get but there may be other ways to bring value that you know I'm not aware of that would bring other people to the table so that's my core question and what why are we stuck to you John.

**[00:37:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting well uh we will we will consider that question momentarily is there more you want to tell us about yourself or any of your specific projects um oh there's so many it's just simply not you know there's there's so much going on so um I can tell you we're the proud parents of the latest red wolf litter that has been born on the planet we a group of us bought 15,000 acres of dewatered ditched coastal north Carolina picosan wetland

**[00:38:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> restore it and now our project is delayed for until mid-June because we have one of the only red wolf litters on the planet that's taken up residency on our this property which is a really wonderful problem to have but you know nothing wrong with delaying the restoration of hydrology in this large acreage for a couple weeks so yeah yeah there's that and then uh we we got invited to albania to look at the coastal well a couple things um our illustrious president and his family walked into albania i don't think he had a direct hand uh and they they basically said we want to do a big resort here but the national park is in the way and they changed the boundary of a dedicated national park

**[00:39:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> give that family access to prime national park land.

**[00:39:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're doing a project with architect Jeanne Gang, Studio Gang in Chicago, a MacArthur fellow that's leveraging a different way to enforce a national reserve.

**[00:39:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're not going to call it a national park.

**[00:39:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So working on a project like that and just a whole bunch of projects.

**[00:39:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Northern Great Plains adaptive multi-pedal grazing study is finding out the same things that we published and you saw in the Soil Carbon Cowboys movie movies or videos.

**[00:39:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> A bunch of so many things.

**[00:39:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's just so exciting.

**[00:39:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Steve, as I understand it, Applied Ecological Services is now a part of RES, whatever that is.

**[00:39:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it still your base of operations or is this?

**[00:39:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> No.

**[00:40:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, I in 2021 I merged applied ecological services about just under 400 staff and 19 offices into REZ and I made a commitment to stand board for two years and after one year the the non-profit work was so exciting and overwhelmingly drawing me that I retired and set up the institute and where I now call home is we my wife and I and four others bought a country club and converted it into a place called the Three Waters Reserve and it's a public a public park that we restored hired the university was constant executive chef and he runs the food and beverage service and so my bit my my office is the basement

**[00:41:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> That used to be the pro shop in the golf course.

**[00:41:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's now a field station for training You know new we call it baby colleges that grow into adult ecologists and my wife Susan Lenhart and others are behind the educational programming and you know foisting that upon the world with wonderful interns that have amazing epiphanies by working in the field of restoration and Measurement and so forth So is this the Institute for Applied Ecology that you're talking about?

**[00:41:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, that it's the applied ecological Institute The Institute can you give us a URL?

**[00:41:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> I got it here.

**[00:41:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> E Institute org.

**[00:41:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah Yeah, I think the Institute for Applied Ecology is in Milbrook New York.

**[00:41:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, it's in Corvallis, Oregon Which is oh, that's right.

**[00:41:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's right.

**[00:41:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay

**[00:42:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, yeah, you know, we have a slogan in the era, we say, what can we all do together that we can't do individually, but and we'll pursue that question in a moment, but you seem to be doing it all individually, although I'm beginning to think that at this point, you've got an army behind you.

**[00:42:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not, it's not as big of a wonderful group of a family of, you know, staff and partners that I used to have.

**[00:42:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's greatly reduced and very focused on a couple of things, although it doesn't sound like it probably is based on what I just told you.

**[00:42:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's based on doing projects on the ground that inform stratifyx, which is the software app, and it's based on doing projects on the ground that that really serve as pilots and demos of take.

**[00:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> on the major challenges.

**[00:43:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's what we're doing.

**[00:43:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> And trying to nail the science and nail the communication and, you know, the art.

**[00:43:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> So Peter Bick, the film producer, working with us, we're working together on the grazing stuff and the on the climate food stuff.

**[00:43:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've got another whole team of communicators that are working on on that and regenerative ag.

**[00:43:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's so many wonderful people.

**[00:43:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not a it's not all under one.

**[00:43:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's it's a wonderful growing team.

**[00:43:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you asked a specific question, which is one that we've been thrashing about ever since we started, which is, how do we somehow get more and more people to understand, you know, that this is this is the most exciting thing about being alive in this particular universe, as far as we know, that

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The future is at stake, and for the coming generation, there's really nothing.

**[00:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's no better prescription for good life than to get on and say, I have the opportunity to save the future.

**[00:44:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But to do that, they have to understand that it's true and that they really can make a difference.

**[00:44:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so how do you get the word out?

**[00:44:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're doing education, I gather, at several different levels.

**[00:44:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I saw that Mike had a comment a bit a few minutes ago.

**[00:44:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Mike, do you want to introduce yourself since you came in a little bit late?

**[00:44:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then also start the discussion about how we can help amplify the kind of work that Steve is doing and that we're all trying to do.

**[00:44:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I apologize.

**[00:44:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> I wasn't following the chat.

**[00:44:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> was trying to...

**[00:44:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, that's okay.

**[00:44:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> If there's questions.

**[00:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys.

**[00:44:56] Mike Lynn**
> No worries.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> Thank you, John.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> I apologize, everybody, for coming in late.

**[00:45:00] Mike Lynn**
> But yeah, you had mentioned you had asked the question is there a way that we could get this in front of other people for continuing education As far as at the academic level, I'm not sure but I know there are institutions that offer Training such as the things like you mentioned Matter of fact, I'm doing one for an organization next month on living shorelines that The people that attend are typically engineers Landscape architects because they come to here for whether it's an hour long to our long full day long And then they get their professional accreditation continuing education hours.

**[00:45:34] Mike Lynn**
> So that might be one avenue.

**[00:45:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's helpful for you to pursue Yeah, we we've been doing that for years with with ASLA and with the the engineering You know groups as well and doing soil bioengineering and the whole range a lot of mine reclamation a lot of river My professor was lonely appalled and river physics and hydrology

**[00:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> been teaching that and but how do you there's so many opportunities how do you build a team around the opportunities and then divide and conquer is what I'm trying to figure out and I've learned a few things you know I thought it was holy as a scientist to get you know 300 people to review a paper and Peter Peter Big it's 600,000 website hits a month on the the the grazing videos now 17 million hits so far in in like 113 countries I can't believe it I mean why do we do science papers why do we write videos seem to be so incredibly you know good interesting yeah so um

**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just want to tag a few future conversations I'd like to have with you and what we shouldn't take at the time.

**[00:47:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have, as you may know, I now know I should send it to you, a project cooking in Panama, where we've said the watershed is a strategic global importance, and that the drought from recent years had such a huge financial impact that it's a really interesting laboratory and demonstration site for trying to show that you can fix climate by fixing ecosystems.

**[00:47:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we're just beginning to get some action on the ground.

**[00:47:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We imagine that when we do that, we're going to have to mobilize lots of people to come up with solutions that better their lives and improve, have measurable impact on local climate and perhaps regional climate.

**[00:47:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it sounds like your software and your expertise might really fit in very well there, so I'll follow up with you on that.

**[00:48:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've done several projects in South America and Costa Rica that have been watershed based restoration projects that we talk about and a bunch of a bunch in North America as well.

**[00:48:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right.

**[00:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The other thing I'll mention is my own answer to the question of how do we engage young people?

**[00:48:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben and I have talked about this a lot.

**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think every school and every university on the planet has got too much pavement, too much parking lots, too much grass, not enough native species.

**[00:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lots and lots of students who are desperate to do something meaningful about the future they're told is coming and probably alumni who would like to give money for a named Miyawaki Forest or another project of that sort.

**[00:48:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would become an outdoor living laboratory and create not just a patch of research.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> stored land, but a cohort of ecosystem restores who know what to do and can fan away from their schools and get it going.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Quaqui Wildcat, one of our ERA members, and I are talking about trying to get something along these lines going, but that recipe, whether it's Miyawaki Forest or some other school-based program, I think should be part of everybody's curriculum.

**[00:49:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I don't know quite a few schools over the years.

**[00:49:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> example, we talked about Seneca Falls a little while ago, John, right in your neighborhood.

**[00:49:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> To do the 1,000-acre Seneca Meadows restoration project around Seneca Falls there, we hired high school students and they collected with us native plant species seeds for prairie wetland savanna.

**[00:50:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a forest from about a about a 30 mile radius.

**[00:50:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then we paid students and we made flats, soil, and seeds available and instructions.

**[00:50:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> And they grew the plants.

**[00:50:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> then for that restoration, we bought plants back with one stipulation that they had to come back with somebody, a relative, a parent, a friend, and plant the plant materials with us.

**[00:50:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And we've done that.

**[00:50:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did that on several mining projects, the Flambeau Mine up in Lady Smith, Wisconsin, and the Jackson County Iron Mine in Black River Falls, starting in the in the mid 80s.

**[00:50:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> And now they're public parks now, these magnificent large landscapes.

**[00:50:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've created durable relationships through that mechanism with the with the community.

**[00:51:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these because now that the families come back to see the plants, they think they planted 20 years ago.

**[00:51:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really wonderful.

**[00:51:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interesting.

**[00:51:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And where are the stories told about these programs that we all agree should be replicated to tools all over the world?

**[00:51:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Seneca Falls story is told in the Audubon Nature Center there at the Seneca Meadows preserve right south of Rochester.

**[00:51:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the stories about Flambomine is told, you can go on the Rio Tinto website, they're so proud of it.

**[00:51:39] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Wisconsin DNR tells the story about those mining projects because instead of planting it with non-native or alfalfa, which is what was originally intended, we planted them with native vegetation, prairies and savanna vegetation, they're fantastic.

**[00:52:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> They just, who are just wildlife areas now, and recreation areas.

**[00:52:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I predict Ben Rubin and I are going to go to the Seneca, what's it called again?

**[00:52:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well it's, it's the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's right on the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> You guys are 45 minutes from there, or something like that.

**[00:52:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is pretty darn close.

**[00:52:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[00:52:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Steve, welcome.

**[00:52:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Steve, it's, it's, it's an amazing, it's work.

**[00:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see you're still going strong.

**[00:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we salute you.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> A couple.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> thank you.

**[00:52:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's an honor.

**[00:52:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, go for it, Natalie.

**[00:52:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, a couple thoughts.

**[00:52:46] Natalie Fleming**
> me, the big change to get, to get people engaged, when you focus on CO2, it's pretty depressing.

**[00:52:52] Natalie Fleming**
> But if, when you focus on the assistive restoration, you can really tie it to breaking the flood drought fire cycle.

**[00:53:01] Natalie Fleming**
> The CO2 focus, CO2 centrism is to me very depressing and slow moving, but eco-restoration is pretty dramatic and powerful.

**[00:53:14] Natalie Fleming**
> There's some fun things that we can do to teach people about climate and ecosystems and, I don't know, to me paragliding.

**[00:53:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I know this sounds crazy, but you talk about peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:25] Natalie Fleming**
> Paragliders, they fly.

**[00:53:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm a pilot.

**[00:53:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> Parasailers, parasailers, they fly and they don't wait for peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:36] Natalie Fleming**
> Right.

**[00:53:37] Natalie Fleming**
> They just get out there and do it and their life depends on understanding microclimates and how the landscape relates to the climate.

**[00:53:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And I do have a picture, I pulled up a slide on where I was down in Utah and they have a spot there, so I didn't actually fly, but they let me play with a kite for a little while.

**[00:53:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Not that crazy yet, but eventually I'll get there.

**[00:54:00] Natalie Fleming**
> I think that focusing on eco restoration over CO2 centrism in the water cycle, focus on the water cycle.

**[00:54:07] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a dramatic difference and it gets people excited because you can make a difference and you can make an immediate change.

**[00:54:13] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's, I think the CO2 is so depressing that people can't get past it and they don't feel like they can really do much about it.

**[00:54:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, we've learned that people are barren by trees because they can see it, see a tree and they don't understand soil carbon.

**[00:54:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's, you know, there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> And there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the soil carbon and all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we've been focusing on is peat and soil carbon projects first and forestry carbons less so.

**[00:54:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I'm a pilot and I'm what's incredible is how violent the winds and the turbulence are now.

**[00:55:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> compared to what they were over the years that I've been flying about 25 or 30 years.

**[00:55:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there are major changes that are occurring that I feel every time I get in the airplane, most every time.

**[00:55:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> So it's very, very frightening to think about flying under some of the conditions that now as a pilot where, you you take off in one place and the prediction isn't quite what it might be projected to be when you're trying to land somewhere.

**[00:55:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[00:55:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant, you have a comment and an observation.

**[00:55:39] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:55:41] sustainavistas**
> I think if we look at the process, mean, first it's not really trees or soil or carbon.

**[00:55:48] sustainavistas**
> I think we're generally talking about changing behavior.

**[00:55:54] sustainavistas**
> And something I'd like to point to, I think Joe has probably a time for us to maybe

**[00:56:00] sustainavistas**
> for me to jump on on and give an update, because we've, so see, we are the founder of my ecological founder of our group, Courtney of Balmeneu, which is more trees now in Dutch, started 14 years ago by himself for about the first five years, challenging the local council.

**[00:56:18] sustainavistas**
> So we just outside Amsterdam Schupper Airport in probably one of the densest population urban areas.

**[00:56:26] sustainavistas**
> And in the Netherlands it started with removing 1000 school tiles and putting, rescuing one tree from a local urban forest and planting that on a thousand schools plains.

**[00:56:39] sustainavistas**
> And that went on for five years and we've now 14 years grown into an organization that's saved, rescued and donated and transplanted in the Netherlands over three million free trees, siblings.

**[00:56:52] sustainavistas**
> 30,000 volunteers and we're now going to six countries, so Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland and France, which is

**[00:57:00] sustainavistas**
> last year started a kit of a project with five ecosystem registration communities of John D.

**[00:57:05] sustainavistas**
> Liu in Ireland, sort of Cree, in Vericelle, in France, Recoviva, in Italy, in Spain, we've just come back from Altiplana and also the EFC headquarters and then obviously we're in Dutch base, so we're spending two years developing training and education materials for that.

**[00:57:27] sustainavistas**
> But if you look at what we're doing, I really think we're probably the first organisation, there's one group in France and I'll correct me if I'm wrong in Australia or the USA or Canada or any other countries that they're doing it, but we basically use nature as a nursery and basically because we use 50 centimetre to two metre high trees, that's like our sweet spot, we can do bigger trees, but that's our sweet spot and these are five to 20-year-old settings, so we really

**[00:58:00] sustainavistas**
> starting with a far better base and then in the temperate north we actually rescue and save and our survival rate is 70 to 80 percent so and it's a free resource so we do about 150 species in the Netherlands and I think that so twice it's really mass participation of communities connecting people to nature and showing them an ecological solution as well as people can actually really scale so I mean this is probably one of the most incredible scalable solutions that's and and and so we would love people we if you look at our more trees now dot eco website we've got a whole communication toolkit we show our manuals our hands everything we've translated four languages but also we give it all away for nothing so have a look at that and I think it could be interesting to use that because if you can I mean we in the winter in our little area near airport skipway airport our biggest tree have we risked 140 000 trees and gave them away for free if we and that's any

**[00:59:00] sustainavistas**
> every day, every day for six months, 10, 20 year volunteers working on it, but if we got paid people, we got thousands of people to do this, and we could do it in 20 or 30 countries, we basically could really ramp up the carbon sequestration, but also change behavior, basically, and really.

**[00:59:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:59:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Grant, you have reminded me that it is indeed time for an update from you.

**[00:59:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll follow up for a report.

**[00:59:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you're right.

**[00:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You have a solution which has scaled and rallied tens of thousands of people.

**[00:59:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We really are in a planet with 8 billion.

**[00:59:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let's see how we can scale that up and then we spread the word.

**[00:59:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> think replicable models is really what we're all looking for in transferability to other systems.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yep.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Exactly.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you.

**[00:59:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you're in the Netherlands.

**[00:59:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> Did I hear that right?

**[00:59:56] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:57] sustainavistas**
> I'm actually looking...

**[01:00:00] sustainavistas**
> My son is, I'm actually in Canada, Quebec for a week, I'm actually looking at starting some trials up in Canada because I've just become a grandparent, so we'll be coming to Canada two or three times a year probably.

**[01:00:12] sustainavistas**
> So our first grandchild was just born in Montreal 19 days ago, so yeah, so I'm actually on a 20 hectare property, so I think this might be one of the first treehouses in Canada.

**[01:00:26] sustainavistas**
> So yeah, let's not take too much more time, but I think let's have a conversation in parallel.

**[01:00:37] sustainavistas**
> One other quick question to the group in order to join, do you know any members that are going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:47] sustainavistas**
> No, I do not.

**[01:00:48] sustainavistas**
> Okay, I'll put that in the email tomorrow, but if you can't follow that, it's probably often New York and London climate week is probably one of the highest profiles, about 40,000.

**[01:01:00] sustainavistas**
> And people go to Paris for three days and it's a really an epic event and a lot of submissions that got a lot of those solutions there and ecosystem restoration is a real big, okay, thanks guys.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thank you, Brett.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, great.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> It sounds like a way to think about transferability of the, you know, the, the.

**[01:01:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> How you change the behavior and less so what you're planning and unless that's critical, but to work across different ecosystems, that'd be great.

**[01:01:32] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, exactly.

**[01:01:33] sustainavistas**
> I mean, for example, one of the small projects, sorry, John, just we start, we kicked off this year, we did an eco fitness.

**[01:01:38] sustainavistas**
> So basically, not only working on the ecological fitness of the forest and the land, but we also work on the fitness and the health and mental fitness people at the same time.

**[01:01:47] sustainavistas**
> So we kick sort of that off this year.

**[01:01:49] sustainavistas**
> So there's some videos on that.

**[01:01:50] sustainavistas**
> That's why it was a bit of fun, but actually we have to pick it up.

**[01:01:53] sustainavistas**
> So we work from November to March for the trees at the moment.

**[01:01:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's basically our model.

**[01:01:57] sustainavistas**
> That's great.

**[01:01:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:01:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:02:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie, you just switched off your camera, but I'm hoping this is your moment to give us your presentation.

**[01:02:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, my friend just came out to see if I wanted some chicken that's a little bit too spicy for me.

**[01:02:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And to see if the kids in the dog can come out and play.

**[01:02:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, did you just say you wanted me to do the presentation now?

**[01:02:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I did.

**[01:02:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I did.

**[01:02:22] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, hopefully I don't start coughing like a crazy one.

**[01:02:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:02:27] Natalie Fleming**
> So, if you've followed me at all on LinkedIn, you know that I obsessed about the water cycle.

**[01:02:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think all problems I'll call every all the problems and ecosystems are caused by bare grounds and bare ground and lack of life.

**[01:02:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I blame everything on the desert and I blame everything on mineral dust just so you know just about.

**[01:02:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I had the opportunity to spend the winter in Salt Lake and it was pretty exciting for me to go back to Salt Lake.

**[01:02:58] Natalie Fleming**
> It is kind of the land of my children.

**[01:03:00] Natalie Fleming**
> sensitivity.

**[01:03:02] Natalie Fleming**
> When I started out in life, lived in the Utah Valley along the Wasatch Front.

**[01:03:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And if you've been paying attention, they have a terrible crisis now where they have the great drought.

**[01:03:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I first got down there in October, I was able to stay on Mount Olympus.

**[01:03:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Olympus looking over the valley and it was absolutely beautiful.

**[01:03:29] Natalie Fleming**
> This picture right here is from there.

**[01:03:32] Natalie Fleming**
> on the mountain side, it has a beautiful forest on the mountain side.

**[01:03:39] Natalie Fleming**
> If you're not familiar with the landscaping of the Great Salt Lake, you've got, as the winds come in from the west, you've got a lot of bare ground.

**[01:03:48] Natalie Fleming**
> You have the salt flats, you have the Great Salt Lake, and then you have these massive huge, I should have written down the exact height of the mountains and to Mount Tipinogus and all these Mount Olympus, they're huge.

**[01:04:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or gargantuan.

**[01:04:02] Natalie Fleming**
> And these mountains are amazing because they really trap in, they have the potential to trap in the moisture.

**[01:04:09] Natalie Fleming**
> But they have been denuding and ripping landscaping and plants out over the last 20 or 30 years.

**[01:04:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I was there 30 years ago, there were orchards and lawns and conifers and deciduous.

**[01:04:27] Natalie Fleming**
> There were all manner of life was there.

**[01:04:30] Natalie Fleming**
> And because the community is trapped between the mountain and the lake, there's very little room for growth.

**[01:04:38] Natalie Fleming**
> And so they've been denuding it.

**[01:04:41] Natalie Fleming**
> as strangely, the rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Thanks.

**[01:04:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I'm going to try this chicken in a minute.

**[01:04:49] Natalie Fleming**
> The rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:52] Natalie Fleming**
> so the solution was to denude the earth some more and rip out more trees and grasses and shrubs.

**[01:04:58] Natalie Fleming**
> And after a minute,

**[01:05:00] Natalie Fleming**
> official of the neighbors.

**[01:05:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, those are some domesticated teenagers.

**[01:05:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Just a second here.

**[01:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're not hearing much of your background.

**[01:05:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, I can hear it.

**[01:05:19] Natalie Fleming**
> I was screaming at him.

**[01:05:22] Natalie Fleming**
> It's a subdivision here.

**[01:05:24] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a full neighborhood going on.

**[01:05:26] Natalie Fleming**
> So they've been denuding the earth and ripping out landscaping and trees.

**[01:05:31] Natalie Fleming**
> The cities have been paying people to rip out vegetation in order to save the water.

**[01:05:40] Natalie Fleming**
> The Great Salt Lake strike team, and their plan to save the lake is to direct all water from the watershed directly to the lake and skip any vegetation in the landscape along the way.

**[01:05:55] Natalie Fleming**
> So I found out three hours ago I'd be doing this presentation.

**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So can I can I share?

**[01:06:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes please.

**[01:06:03] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay so um desktop one you're going to see all my stuff here all the kids um here is a video I wasn't able to export this video to the right format so uh this is the rocks that they are landscaping with now there used to be vegetation here and ripped it out in order to not use water their focus is is stopping water usage they don't understand the water cycle not used so they put in this rock landscaping and you can hear the highway this is the landscaping that they've put in and while I was driving around the valley I would stop and take pictures and videos as I went along and I was just horrified so you see these rocks we see the tree above ahead um this is a you know you're looking at a quarter mile of rocks and as I step into the trees you're going to see what they ripped out to save water

**[01:07:01] Natalie Fleming**
> And you're going to see, you know, six foot tall grasses, trees, shrubs, and a little small riparian area.

**[01:07:08] Natalie Fleming**
> I had the sound on, you would hear the birds chirping.

**[01:07:12] Natalie Fleming**
> And this whole area is next to the lake.

**[01:07:16] Natalie Fleming**
> It's between the lake and Jordan River.

**[01:07:18] Natalie Fleming**
> And they ripped down all this vegetation.

**[01:07:21] Natalie Fleming**
> And I have videos of the machines continuing to rip out more and more vegetation.

**[01:07:25] Natalie Fleming**
> There is very little of this left.

**[01:07:29] Natalie Fleming**
> So this is, of course, a month ago.

**[01:07:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So the spring hasn't come yet.

**[01:07:33] Natalie Fleming**
> I should probably go back in a month when it's all green.

**[01:07:38] Natalie Fleming**
> But they've just ripped this all out and the soil was rich and thick and soft and moist.

**[01:07:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And these are the tall pompous grass that they have.

**[01:07:47] Natalie Fleming**
> And they're ripping this out to save the water and to conserve water, because this is obviously using water.

**[01:07:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And they don't even understand that water is not used, water is cycled.

**[01:08:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, um, it's pretty horrific.

**[01:08:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, sorry, let's put that over here.

**[01:08:05] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Let's see.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> How are we going to go to slide show, uh, please start.

**[01:08:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:13] Natalie Fleming**
> So I threw this together real quick.

**[01:08:15] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, there's a picture.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> The great.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it is a shrunk exponentially.

**[01:08:21] Natalie Fleming**
> How do I go to the next?

**[01:08:23] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, I gotta move you guys over where I can't see you anymore.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> I think.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> Because you're, I can't say anything.

**[01:08:30] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, there we go.

**[01:08:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's in the 1980s.

**[01:08:33] Natalie Fleming**
> was about 3000 square miles.

**[01:08:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And now it's down to 150.

**[01:08:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's down to less than a third of what it was before.

**[01:08:40] Natalie Fleming**
> And as the lake shrinks, um, they've got some serious problems.

**[01:08:48] Natalie Fleming**
> One of the next to the lake, this is I, I am LDS and we build chapels everywhere and under advisement of the local community.

**[01:08:57] Natalie Fleming**
> They were advised to landscape in this manner.

**[01:09:00] Natalie Fleming**
> To use rocks and I compare using rocks as landscaping as using skulls and bones to landscape rocks are the are the skull.

**[01:09:08] Natalie Fleming**
> They're the structure of the earth and the soil and the trees.

**[01:09:12] Natalie Fleming**
> That is the flesh of the earth.

**[01:09:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So imagine just ripping the flesh off of your arm, which is grotesque and expecting the blood to flow and it's not flowing.

**[01:09:20] Natalie Fleming**
> So we know from Zach wise and water stories about Lancaster and all these wonderful people that you're supposed to sink slow and spread the water and then get as much vegetation as you can out of it to get the body pump going.

**[01:09:33] Natalie Fleming**
> And as you can see this particular structure, they've done the opposite.

**[01:09:38] Natalie Fleming**
> The tall this next right next to this was seven foot tall pompous grass that was ripped out and this is right.

**[01:09:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is Lakefront property.

**[01:09:46] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was water conservation gone wrong.

**[01:09:50] Natalie Fleming**
> If we do not have plants, you're not going to have rain.

**[01:09:54] Natalie Fleming**
> lot of people think the plants come because of the rain, but it's just like the chicken and the egg.

**[01:10:00] Natalie Fleming**
> to have vegetation and plants and great soil to keep the biotic pump going.

**[01:10:04] Natalie Fleming**
> I need to explain the bi...

**[01:10:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I can't let me put you back up there.

**[01:10:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I don't think you do actually.

**[01:10:09] Natalie Fleming**
> I do it.

**[01:10:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Everybody here gets it.

**[01:10:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[01:10:11] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:10:12] Natalie Fleming**
> can skip, so I don't have to explain the biotic pump.

**[01:10:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I can do that, but I think you guys are all versed in it.

**[01:10:19] Natalie Fleming**
> So the water cycle is completely biological in line out.

**[01:10:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And it's transpiration as an engine.

**[01:10:27] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:10:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So I don't need to explain that to you.

**[01:10:38] Natalie Fleming**
> So all of this, you already know?

**[01:10:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I think we are, we're here because we all share the same basic understanding.

**[01:10:48] Natalie Fleming**
> So here is the view from the place I was initially staying at.

**[01:10:51] Natalie Fleming**
> it's just beautiful, these mountains, and there's a great biodiversity of trees.

**[01:10:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And my plan for the Great Salt Lake would be to harvest all of the seeds,

**[01:11:00] Natalie Fleming**
> on this and set up nurseries and the mountains on the other side of the valley are barren.

**[01:11:06] Natalie Fleming**
> And so if we took the trees and expanded the forestry system, but they're cutting down trees, they're cutting down conifers because they all use water.

**[01:11:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it was very heartbreaking to see.

**[01:11:20] Natalie Fleming**
> the ancient Amazonians, they used the mountains to their advantage to trap in the as the clouds came in, as the moisture came in, they created water retention landscapes and built structures to really maximize vegetation and trap the water in.

**[01:11:35] Natalie Fleming**
> the Great Salt Lake in the Wasatch Front, that area has a great advantage with that great mountain that could trap in an incredible amount of water.

**[01:11:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is what I saw everywhere where by mandate the trees, the homes were built with rock landscaping, which to me is kind of like Terminator where they're walking on the skulls.

**[01:11:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the bones of the earth.

**[01:12:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Can you explain to you how and why?

**[01:12:02] Natalie Fleming**
> they're just directoring all vegetation over.

**[01:12:05] Natalie Fleming**
> then the lake has the lake bed because it does not drain anywhere else.

**[01:12:12] Natalie Fleming**
> It has a lot of arsenic lead in mercury and selenium that as it dries out, it's kicking that dust.

**[01:12:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And the ice nucleating temperatures of that dust, meaning its rainfall potential is very, very low.

**[01:12:25] Natalie Fleming**
> It has to be super, super, super cold in order for it to stimulate rainfall.

**[01:12:28] Natalie Fleming**
> So that's super bad.

**[01:12:32] Natalie Fleming**
> It was super depressing for me to see this because when I left, there were orchards and herds and all sorts of things.

**[01:12:38] Natalie Fleming**
> this unleashing pollutants, there's a health crisis because of the asthma and heart disease.

**[01:12:43] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got arsenic in the air.

**[01:12:46] Natalie Fleming**
> They've convinced a lot of local farmers to redirect water from the farm to the lake.

**[01:12:53] Natalie Fleming**
> And they think it's gonna help.

**[01:12:54] Natalie Fleming**
> So you already know what temperature, okay, don't need to give you that.

**[01:12:59] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:13:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, this is a view, a picture I took this winter when the snow was there and you can see that from the side of the mountain, you can see the clouds forming and rumbling on this side.

**[01:13:12] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on that.

**[01:13:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on any of this.

**[01:13:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So, on the right is a picture of what I, I took both these pictures.

**[01:13:22] Natalie Fleming**
> These were side by side.

**[01:13:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And on the right, this is along a riverbed, the Jordan River.

**[01:13:28] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping out massive amounts.

**[01:13:30] Natalie Fleming**
> I could show you the whole video of them piling up the dirt and shipping it off and then saying, we're having a drought.

**[01:13:36] Natalie Fleming**
> I just don't know why.

**[01:13:37] Natalie Fleming**
> if they, yeah, I don't know the polite way to tell them they're all stupid.

**[01:13:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> Natalie, did you see any good examples of landscaping that might be nothing at all?

**[01:13:53] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping everything out that they consider the rock landscaping is good.

**[01:13:57] Natalie Fleming**
> This right here.

**[01:13:58] Natalie Fleming**
> This isn't Saratoga Springs.

**[01:14:00] Natalie Fleming**
> If you look closely, those are logs.

**[01:14:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the only trees I found in that area when I was driving all of that particular area.

**[01:14:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the logs.

**[01:14:10] Natalie Fleming**
> They were building new subdivisions.

**[01:14:11] Natalie Fleming**
> They're building massive, massive subdivisions and they obviously they cut down some tree.

**[01:14:17] Natalie Fleming**
> But the focus is that that uses water.

**[01:14:20] Natalie Fleming**
> They're really obsessed with removing anything that uses water.

**[01:14:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Natalie, do you talk, do you give this presentation in Salt Lake City?

**[01:14:33] Natalie Fleming**
> No, I made this presentation an hour ago for tonight.

**[01:14:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you?

**[01:14:38] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact these people.

**[01:14:40] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email address.

**[01:14:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact Brian Stede.

**[01:14:43] Natalie Fleming**
> He is at the University of Utah.

**[01:14:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I got a really good reference person, really top notch person.

**[01:14:49] Natalie Fleming**
> He me the reference.

**[01:14:50] Natalie Fleming**
> He didn't really return the calls.

**[01:14:52] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email addresses of everybody on the right team.

**[01:14:55] Natalie Fleming**
> everybody, I don't know how to approach them without being a jerk, really, without telling them they're.

**[01:15:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Scrooming things up because who am I and they're hydrologists and geologists and all these.

**[01:15:05] Natalie Fleming**
> These are university hydrologists, but PhDs and post PhDs and teach at the university and who am I to go and tell them they're.

**[01:15:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> You know, the, the LDS church, we worked on the city creek.

**[01:15:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, the, uh, the mall, we were the folks that brought.

**[01:15:22] SteveApfelbaum**
> Uh, city creek to the surface that runs to the mall.

**[01:15:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the, the for profit arm.

**[01:15:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the foundation arm of the Mormon church.

**[01:15:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, very focused on the water desert ranch million acre ranch.

**[01:15:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're trying to figure out how to, you know, I wonder if the LDS angle rather than.

**[01:15:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Going to the city would be worth doing.

**[01:15:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> then the other angle is, um, we're working with the CEO of, uh, who bought big power mountain.

**[01:16:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's 20,000 acres.

**[01:16:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's really interested in setting a regional example of how to restore the water cycle.

**[01:16:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was really trying to get to eco of the ag reserves, which is the for business entity.

**[01:16:16] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was unable to break through and I am LDS and I've talked to my bishop.

**[01:16:22] Natalie Fleming**
> said, who do I talk to other than embarrass the church on LinkedIn, which I did.

**[01:16:27] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, maybe you can help me if you have the contacts.

**[01:16:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Send me an email and I'll see if the contacts are still viable.

**[01:16:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because we worked with them for six or seven years.

**[01:16:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I lived in Roosevelt, Utah and became very close with leaders in the church.

**[01:16:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because there's so many Jack Mormons and Roosevelt, they were afraid they were going to lose the tribe out there.

**[01:16:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So he even went after little Jewish boys like me to indoctrinate us.

**[01:17:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Just so you know, Jack Mormons are Mormons that don't quite abide.

**[01:17:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> No, I know that.

**[01:17:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I know that.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Oh, I know.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> I just saw everybody else listening.

**[01:17:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> I know what a Jack Mormon is.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> You're from the mountainside.

**[01:17:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So when I was there for the first month, I didn't understand why the lake was shrinking because I didn't actually go through the valley the first month.

**[01:17:20] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I've got some great shots.

**[01:17:21] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was good.

**[01:17:24] Natalie Fleming**
> The landowner actually wanted to clear something.

**[01:17:25] Natalie Fleming**
> So you can see a lot of bare ground that here with this forest, the mountain sides don't have many trees over there.

**[01:17:32] Natalie Fleming**
> And there were certain sides that had more trees.

**[01:17:35] Natalie Fleming**
> So these are the beautiful views that I got to see.

**[01:17:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I guess that's the end of that.

**[01:17:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> And those are big fire scars.

**[01:17:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those aren't from logging.

**[01:17:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those are wildfire scars from the early 20s and 1910.

**[01:17:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did the master plan for the open space system for Salt Lake City.

**[01:17:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's really interesting how fires played a big role.

**[01:17:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ranching and early fires.

**[01:18:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, if, if I'll send you my information, if you can help in there, there's several different, I could tell you all the stories of all the ways I tried to get in and try to reach the right people.

**[01:18:12] Natalie Fleming**
> But I do have the list of email address of everybody on the great Salt Lake strike team, but I have hesitated to email them because who is Natalie Fleming to go in and tell them.

**[01:18:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Natalie Fleming is now acquainted with Steve Applebaum, who it turns out has got roots in the area.

**[01:18:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if it is Natalie's diagnosis, roughly correct that they're doing almost exactly the wrong thing if they want to turn this around.

**[01:18:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're desertifying the area and not building capacity for water retention and for in the soil system and for lagging the runoff, the hydrograph.

**[01:18:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everything's running off the land so quickly.

**[01:18:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So yeah, it's the right, it's the right thing, but the church isn't easy to do.

**[01:19:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> to unless you get to the for-profit arm because they're paying for a lot of these problems.

**[01:19:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're, you know, the community suffering, the erosion and infrastructure damages are really significantly expensive.

**[01:19:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So I'm pretty distressed because at church they announced that they're going to do this great program to reduce vegetation on all the churches across the world and I want to go to them.

**[01:19:23] Natalie Fleming**
> I know they're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do this and I'm like who do I tell them that because Brigham Young taught us we're supposed to make the earth as a garden of Eden not Mars and that picture there of everything's going dark on me all of a sudden.

**[01:19:40] Natalie Fleming**
> That picture is, it looks like you're looking for the rover on it.

**[01:19:45] Natalie Fleming**
> It's so bad and I really want to sit down with them and say they're going to spend hundreds of millions possibly a billion dollars to do massive eco-destruction believing they're doing the right thing.

**[01:20:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We'll give Rob Lewis a chance to vent here.

**[01:20:03] Natalie Fleming**
> can see that his head is exploding.

**[01:20:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Go, Rob.

**[01:20:09] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Well, wow, what a great presentation.

**[01:20:12] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> thank you so much for what you're doing and a couple things.

**[01:20:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> One, in terms of who is Natalie Fleming, you may have to go to small groups of people and spread your story.

**[01:20:24] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And then Natalie Fleming will be someone with 100 angry citizens behind her.

**[01:20:28] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> That makes a big difference in whether city officials will listen.

**[01:20:33] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> the main thing I want to mention is when you mentioned the rains disappearing and as he described that situation, I was hearing me on over and over.

**[01:20:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Nicely, the situation he described.

**[01:20:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> He talked about the carrier component and the trigger component.

**[01:20:53] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And the carrier component is the moisture that comes in from a larger system.

**[01:20:58] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Mediterranean sea in the case of Mediterranean sea.

**[01:21:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> But it sounds like it's the sea in Salt Lake.

**[01:21:07] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> It's Salt Lake that's providing the moisture, and then you have the trigger, which is the vegetation.

**[01:21:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So they're reproducing the desertification, as Steve said, but in a particular way, very similar to what Mian was talking about.

**[01:21:26] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And, of course, it was always kind of assumed that he was referring to situations in Mediterranean climate, and they tended to be coastal situations, but this points to this happening in any kind of climate, and inland.

**[01:21:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So, yeah, my mind is kind of blowing up.

**[01:21:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> This is amazing what you're doing, and never doubt yourself.

**[01:21:54] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> I mean, who is Natalie Fleming?

**[01:21:56] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> She's this amazing woman who has figured all this stuff out.

**[01:22:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> and is just getting a start, start, yeah, please.

**[01:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I think he's right, Natalie, you mentioned today that you're thinking about politics, but I actually think that your best path to politics might well be to really say, this is who Natalie Fleming is on this topic.

**[01:22:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's only going to become more and more clear that you were right and that you had the courage to say it.

**[01:22:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it actually, I think, would give you a very distinctive brand as a politician if you led with that.

**[01:22:41] Natalie Fleming**
> And this form of environmentalism is agreeable to both sides, both the left and the right politically.

**[01:22:49] Natalie Fleming**
> But one exciting thing for me is if we can get the LDS church on board is that LDS church has properties all over the world and they have a missionary mindset and they have missionaries all over the world.

**[01:23:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, and the missionaries are required to put it in a certain number of hours of service in their community, wherever they are.

**[01:23:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And that is non, non, across the lighting service.

**[01:23:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:23:10] Natalie Fleming**
> And so, getting these youth, getting the youth trained before they go on emissions on this stuff.

**[01:23:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is one thing.

**[01:23:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:23:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The one thing we can do together that we can't do individually is to have Natalie compare notes with Steve and to Steve see if he can find a way in based on the fact that he.

**[01:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape that you're now reporting the destruction of.

**[01:23:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he has connections to some of the people whose interests.

**[01:23:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Maybe in preservation and restoration rather than in landscaping and tree cutting.

**[01:23:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can definitely try to help Natalie.

**[01:23:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> The, what I've learned is.

> Find the locations where it's working.

> leverage and springboard off of those.

**[01:24:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> in some of the neighborhoods, unfortunately the more affluent neighborhoods in Salt Lake City on the on the school below the bench, there's people doing native landscaping and there's people doing graywater management.

**[01:24:18] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:24:25] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:25:05] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:25:10] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anything that doesn't have the reflectivity, the albedo and the heating capacity and the imperviousness that they're creating would be better and unfortunately lawn is better than what they're doing, but it's not much better.

**[01:25:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> But yeah, we could talk about that further.

**[01:25:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've written a couple of papers on the role of landscapes in water management that might be useful.

**[01:25:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Not on the Jordan River, but we've looked at the changes in river flow over about 100 years and increasing increasing amount of runoff and increasing low flows of increased

**[01:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> 400 times over historic low flows and the displaying the river in the Chicago region, median flows have increased if I recall about 250 times on average over historic flows and the high flow events are three to five times the historic high flow flood events.

**[01:26:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's in a paper we did with Leopold.

**[01:26:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we're doing is we've flip-flopped the hydrology at the watershed scale from a groundwater recharge and infiltration and very long lag time.

**[01:26:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> The lag is the time period between the center of the mass of the rainfall distribution, the center of the mass of the runoff distribution hydrograph.

**[01:26:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've converted recharge-based systems into surface runoff based systems and it's every urban watershed.

**[01:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's very few that that hasn't happened to, and virtually every agricultural watershed, the same thing has happened.

**[01:27:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the story is very well understood, but what's not understood in urban areas, at least in the West, in Salt Lake, a lot of the people there are new customers, and they're interested in high dollar houses with minimal landscaping.

**[01:27:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's part of what the Netflix owner at Big Powder Mountain wants to get across to the people moving into these 20 million dollar homes.

**[01:27:41] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, one of the things that set me is that the church in good faith has donated hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water to go from the farmland to skip the farmland and go direct to the lake.

**[01:27:57] Natalie Fleming**
> Which is

> Yeah, thank you.

**[01:28:15] Natalie Fleming**
> I would love to speak with you, Steve, if we can get some.

**[01:28:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, I'd be glad.

**[01:28:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some other really critical issues that nobody knows about there, except the FAA, the white pelicans that nest out on, I can't remember the island, Pelican Island is what we called it.

**[01:31:10] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'm not jealous.

**[01:31:12] Ben Rubin**
> Looking at, yeah, how to bring some of these, some of the new arrivals to Rochester, go to a special school in the public school system, it's a two-year program where I work.

**[01:32:12] Ben Rubin**
> You know, the curriculum that I bring in, there's a courtyard right next to the classroom.

**[01:32:20] Ben Rubin**
> So I've got a little presentation.

**[01:32:22] Ben Rubin**
> You know, my, my project is literally looking at a very small space in the.

**[01:32:27] Ben Rubin**
> You know, 150 year old school building.

**[01:32:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's pretty small scale, the idea of.

**[01:32:37] Ben Rubin**
> Looking at education and how to transfer some of these larger issues and world challenges into the interest of young students.

**[01:32:52] Ben Rubin**
> I'm seeing if I can share my screen.

**[01:32:57] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see.

**[01:32:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can.

**[01:32:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There you go.

**[01:33:00] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see if this is a hold on a moment.

**[01:33:04] Ben Rubin**
> Okay.

**[01:33:07] Ben Rubin**
> Nope.

**[01:33:09] Ben Rubin**
> Not this one.

**[01:33:10] Ben Rubin**
> Let me see if I can transfer the link over one second.

**[01:33:13] Ben Rubin**
> Apologies.

**[01:33:20] Ben Rubin**

**[01:33:27] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah.

**[01:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:33:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It sounds like it'd be a nice, nice trip.

**[01:33:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben, I do see the, well, I'm just going to bring it over from another window.

**[01:33:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's a cool bird, birding hot spot, John.

**[01:33:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's like the only place you can reliably see American bitterns and clapper rails.

**[01:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really a pretty damn cool place.

**[01:34:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[01:34:07] Ben Rubin**
> Sorry.

**[01:34:10] Ben Rubin**

**[01:34:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:34:41] Ben Rubin**
> We're looking at your screen, Ben.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**

**[01:35:04] Ben Rubin**
> Doing different projects.

**[01:35:06] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see, this one is making bird feeders out of the milk cartons in the lunchroom.

**[01:35:13] Ben Rubin**
> We did planters, leaf tracing, different things.

**[01:35:21] Ben Rubin**
> I guess I'd be interested to share this small project.

**[01:35:27] Ben Rubin**
> It's looking at the courtyard space as it's been used and trying to figure out how to find opportunities to bring the students out during all the four seasons.

**[01:35:38] Ben Rubin**
> There is a cherry tree that fruits in the spring, and there's two fig bushes that fruit in the fall.

**[01:35:48] Ben Rubin**
> So it's nice to sort of have those as bookends.

**[01:35:50] Ben Rubin**
> just to give a small window into what's outside my window.

**[01:35:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:35:59] Ben Rubin**
> One of the things.

**[01:36:00] Ben Rubin**

**[01:36:02] Ben Rubin**
> I teach K through 12.

**[01:36:04] Ben Rubin**
> So, you know, my day is kind of this developmental bender of starting out with five year olds and ending with, you know, sometimes 21 year olds.

**[01:36:13] Ben Rubin**
> I've been looking at, let's see, I can share some of this.

**[01:36:17] Ben Rubin**
> I keep the sketchbook.

**[01:36:19] Ben Rubin**
> That's kind of my main artistic practice.

**[01:36:22] Ben Rubin**
> are some sketchbook notes that I've taken doing different educational programs here in upstate New York.

**[01:36:32] Ben Rubin**
> The students also, I think, really benefit from that practice.

**[01:36:38] Ben Rubin**
> So, we bind sketchbooks.

**[01:36:40] Ben Rubin**
> We use tetrapack containers, which are just recycled mill cartons, you know, K through 12.

**[01:36:46] Ben Rubin**
> The students are involved with, you know, binding these books and then learn, you know, practices for journaling.

**[01:36:56] Ben Rubin**
> I think what's really exciting is

**[01:37:00] Ben Rubin**
> look at how to take some of this stuff outside.

**[01:37:02] Ben Rubin**
> we've done a little bit of that.

**[01:37:04] Ben Rubin**
> Again, these are some of my sketchbooks, in terms of the classroom, you know, just sharing some different ideas that I've had using recycled materials and journaling to kids outside.

**[01:37:25] Ben Rubin**
> This is actually the Cornell webcam with birds.

**[01:37:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's something that we use often in the classroom.

**[01:37:36] Ben Rubin**
> You know, sort of rambling, but yeah, that's really it.

**[01:37:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> What Ben, what did the kids gravitate toward when you take them outside?

**[01:37:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Is there anything that they're really drawn to?

**[01:37:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> it activity like a bird that flies into the view?

**[01:37:55] Ben Rubin**
> What draws them?

**[01:37:57] Ben Rubin**
> You know, being able to take

**[01:38:00] Ben Rubin**
> things or trace things.

**[01:38:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, hands-on stuff, of course.

**[01:38:06] Ben Rubin**
> I feel like just being outside is, they're inside all day.

**[01:38:14] Ben Rubin**
> Public school is really just marching from one room to the other and sometimes just being able to get a sense of where the sun is in the sky and spending a half an hour outside makes a big difference.

**[01:38:29] Ben Rubin**
> It's this little wall up courtyard.

**[01:38:31] Ben Rubin**
> The school was built by Italian immigrants or it was started with an Italian community a long time ago.

**[01:38:40] Ben Rubin**
> So there's some of this stuff.

**[01:38:41] Ben Rubin**
> There's the figs and the cherries that are from previous generations that most of it is just weeds.

**[01:38:55] Natalie Fleming**
> What I find exciting about your work is

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think something inherent in all of us that about growing food, that that basic thing that we have power over gives you a sense of power for the rest of your life.

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**
> But there's also a sort of a project inspired by that book with these postcards of people from around the world writing messages to, you know, basically migrating peoples.

**[01:40:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned Ben, school is Rochester International Academy.

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is a sanctuary city, controversially this year, of course, and the population is very diverse and includes brand new immigrants, some of them from Afghanistan who incidentally Ben helped bring to Rochester.

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[01:52:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Send me an email or click the link.

**[01:52:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let me know if the link works.

**[01:53:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see you again soon.

**[01:53:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys for the wonderful conversation.

**[01:53:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:53:11] Katie Ross**

**[00:21:06] Ben Rubin**
> There was a small grant that I got over the summer to do some training and get certified with some different strategies on that.

**[00:21:15] Ben Rubin**
> I figured I'd just share it's a small project, but I can share that and get some ideas from all of you.

**[00:21:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:21:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:21:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The incomparable Indie Singh is here.

**[00:21:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you turn on your video and say hello?

**[00:21:29] indy singh**
> Of course.

**[00:21:30] indy singh**
> Hey guys.

**[00:21:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's up?

**[00:21:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How are you doing?

**[00:21:37] indy singh**
> Faze right now.

**[00:21:38] indy singh**
> How do I do this?

**[00:21:40] indy singh**
> Should I land first or should I keep the spaceship?

**[00:21:44] indy singh**
> What's up everybody?

**[00:21:46] indy singh**
> I hope you all are doing well.

**[00:21:48] indy singh**
> Thank you all for all the restoration work.

**[00:21:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indie, think you're going behind the moon right now.

**[00:21:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> You're breaking up.

**[00:22:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Alright, let's see.

**[00:22:01] indy singh**
> Let's see, let's see, let's see.

**[00:22:02] indy singh**
> Let's see if you guys can hear me now.

**[00:22:04] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, we got a flavor for Indy.

**[00:22:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Indy, I've noticed you've been really active.

**[00:22:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> seems like you really got something great going on.

**[00:22:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'd like an update, but your connectivity is not good at this moment.

**[00:22:16] indy singh**
> How about now?

**[00:22:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> looks like everything was really high right now on my end.

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure?

**[00:22:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> bit more.

**[00:22:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can mention, Katie and Ben, that our ritual here at the ERA, which may change soon, is that ERA members become ERA members when they introduce themselves at a town hall meeting, which you have now done.

**[00:22:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a week later, assuming there are no objections, you've become full-fledged members with all the rights and responsibilities, too, which really basically just include checking in every so often, subscribing to our social media, findable through our website, and then

**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Passing on social media that resonate with you when you think would resonate with your network To other people in your network.

**[00:23:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It is also possible to Donate to the ERA.

**[00:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's a link on our website, and I am laboring mightily to try to get a Majority of our members to become recurring donors at whatever level they would like even a dollar a month because that It's a good thing and it actually tells us a little something about what we can count on All I'm going through routine issues here, I will mention that we do have our annual general meeting next month on May 14th, I believe and in preparation for that We're all Trying to assess what has happened since a year ago, and I am now putting into the chat a form Where Natalie

**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> mentioned that he just published a book, and Steve can mention that he just published a book, and Rob can mention that he just published another article, and we will try to bring all of that together in time from May 14th.

**[00:24:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, well, you will of course give our speakers your undivided attention.

**[00:24:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> I urge you to click the link.

**[00:24:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This form is basically untested, and see if you can put some information in it, and then I'll know if it works because I'm going be sending it to everybody in the ERA, all four to five hundred of us.

**[00:24:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:24:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First guest and speaker and soon-to-be ERA member is Steve Apfelbaum, a book of whose I have in my living room, and I started quite some time ago when I heard about him through Bio4Climate, and apparently the author of many books with more to come.

**[00:24:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Steve, give us your story, please.

**[00:24:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well, where do I start?

**[00:25:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, as a young child, nature was my passion, my bliss, uh, rehabilitating injured and raising baby animals was, uh, I did and was on a veterinary medicine tract to work with wild animals and, uh, and in vet school and a professor said, Hey, you love canoeing in wilderness.

**[00:25:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's a grant to do some research in a wilderness area.

**[00:25:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I said, Oh, wow, you mean like not having to take care of dogs and city cats?

**[00:25:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it turned out we got the grant and spent basically fast forward 40 years of staying the fire ecology of the boundary water, wilderness, and Quedicope Provincial Park couldn't be

**[00:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Northeastern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario and basically went on to graduate school as a result of that opportunity.

**[00:26:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> And my whole life has been focused on studying the healthiest ecosystems on the planet, measuring biodiversity, a whole range of functions, publishing technical articles, learning what we can from those systems and then emulating that and bringing that into design in urban systems and rural systems.

**[00:26:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So learning from caribou and bison and working with grazing systems, the soil carbon cowboy series that you may or may not have heard about, that's our work with Alan Williams and Gabe Brown.

**[00:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a whole bunch of people.

**[00:27:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now we've worked on about 100 million acres bringing improved grazing and provided the science and are continuing to expand on the climate mitigation opportunities and the biodiversity mitigation opportunities.

**[00:27:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That introduced me to the need for translating the science into market language.

**[00:27:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We put together in 2009 with Ratan Lal and a number of the top soil scientists on the planet, a carbon measurement protocol that became a global standard.

**[00:27:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Vera published it as VM0021.

**[00:27:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've subsequently converted that into a family of standards called the Regenerative Standard.

**[00:27:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> And last year alone, we have with project developers

**[00:28:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for about a million acres of improved grazing in North America and were on a track to hit 20 to 30 million acres in five or six years.

**[00:28:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> One of the things that we learned during the process of trying to work at landscape scales and get the science right and get the policy right and get the market right and get the trust and transparency right, was that there was no way to ecological literacy across any of those subjects.

**[00:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we spun out a company.

**[00:28:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> I retired from my company, Applied Ecological Services, about in 2021 and spun up a non-profit called Applied Ecological Institute.

**[00:28:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm Wisconsin based, Katie.

**[00:28:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're in southern Wisconsin.

**[00:29:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these heads.

**[00:29:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that organization has started a new company called Stratifix, which is a subscriber SaaS-based business that is basically bringing 200 or more datasets and mapping capabilities to any piece of land in the U.S.

**[00:29:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> currently and North America, less detailed.

**[00:29:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> But you can look at any piece of property.

**[00:29:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll immediately have the land ownership and all sorts of other amazing data, assessed value, value of improvements.

**[00:29:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then there's nearly 200 natural resource datasets that you can apply to that property.

**[00:29:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can do scenario planning for evaluating different land uses, whether it be restoration,

**[00:30:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> for agricultural practices, adapt to multi-pedic grazing versus continuous conventional no-till versus whatever pillage.

**[00:30:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you can evaluate different crops.

**[00:30:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you could do highest and best value optimization using actual real-time spot pricing for the commodities and all the NASS USDA data sets with the average soil yields and the economics for every county in the US.

**[00:30:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> So that's spun up and that's really helping us do restoration at scale, including we used it to do about a billion and a half acre prioritization of all the grassland restoration opportunities in North America.

**[00:30:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's now being used by the voluntary carbon market by a number of players to go out and secure.

**[00:31:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or the landowner partnering relationships to do the improved grazing.

**[00:31:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a lot of that stuff that I've been working on.

**[00:31:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Education is kind of what brought me to contact you, John.

**[00:31:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> I've been teaching for about 12 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, co-teaching a class on the future of coastal ecosystems on the planet.

**[00:31:26] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then with COVID, I kind of retired from that job because it was no fun teaching over Zoom.

**[00:31:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, the personal relationships and the field work with the students is what really kind of made everything work well.

**[00:31:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> But there's an incredible unmet demand for bringing ecosystem restoration to not just the landowners that may have no technical training and what they want is, you know, how to

**[00:32:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do I do this?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do?

**[00:32:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> What do I do first?

**[00:32:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> What's it going to cost?

**[00:32:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> What are the downsides?

**[00:32:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> know, what are my decisions and how significant are they or can I grow into it lightly and kind of learn along the route?

**[00:32:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what I've proposed to the ecological society is a series of two-hour primers which I've already been teaching.

**[00:32:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> I did two of them in the past month with them and then a six or a 12-hour online class and then one week classes in the field in various places around the starting here in Wisconsin, southern Wisconsin.

**[00:32:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> we're doing huge coastal restorations in North Carolina right now.

**[00:32:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're doing huge projects, setting up a very large project in Alabama.

**[00:33:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've worked throughout the Americas, Central and South America.

**[00:33:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's all sorts of opportunities in different geographies to leverage those different geographies for training and really building a capacity to take restoration as a primary nature-based solution package to climate and water and biodiversity and food.

**[00:33:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> And, you know, also nutrition, all this to civilization, basically.

**[00:33:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> So I've been trying to work on that and what AEI is spending out our solutions and education around some of our biggest challenges.

**[00:33:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> Climate being one, biodiversity being another food, nutritional density and, you know, we can go on and on and on.

**[00:33:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's a bunch of other things.

**[00:33:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> We started a new food company.

**[00:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> me with the former chairman of Whole Foods, who was the chairman for 23 years, called the Client Food Company, that's focused on not just perennializing agriculture, but using long, long-used and traditional native foods that nobody pays attention to unless it's prepared right and then you ask, what the hell is this?

**[00:34:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're commercializing.

**[00:34:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> We have FDA approval for human consumption of two native perigraphs, grains, and the nutritional value, this is a reference for genuine wild rye, almost for genitus, 23 to 28 percent digestible protein, incredibly well-balanced macro and micronutrient profiles, taste profiles, which I can't taste the difference, but the chefs that we've hired can

**[00:35:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> you know say things that I never quite understand but we're introducing that into a cookie line that may be at Whole Foods and we've just released a new cookie an old cookie that was the very famous cookie here in Madison Wisconsin called the gorilla cookie and soon we'll be introducing Virginia Wilder I flower into that cookie so Katie if you if you happen down into Madison gonna go to the Willy Street co-op and get gorilla cookies which was the anti-war protester cookie of choice in the 60s Vietnam War and now it's introduced the original recipe that was lost in time and nearly extinct never said that about a cookie so I think I think you know one of the questions I had is how do we bring non-science people to

**[00:36:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> recognize value in a cookie, cookie monster restoration once the cookies are over there or banned their monsters.

**[00:36:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> How do we bring people to see value and want to participate in, you know, participatory learning, you know, hands-on training and also maybe on ramping, you know, less formal and more ways for people to don't go to festivals.

**[00:36:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Don't ask, don't ask.

**[00:36:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'll shut up.

**[00:36:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anyways, that's a question and how could we get the word out to bring more people to some of this training and ecological societies trying to figure out how they can offer continuing education credit CEUs so that students can, you know, into this and see value in their career track.

**[00:37:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> can also see value with their you know with their college you know the degree the credits they get but there may be other ways to bring value that you know I'm not aware of that would bring other people to the table so that's my core question and what why are we stuck to you John.

**[00:37:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting well uh we will we will consider that question momentarily is there more you want to tell us about yourself or any of your specific projects um oh there's so many it's just simply not you know there's there's so much going on so um I can tell you we're the proud parents of the latest red wolf litter that has been born on the planet we a group of us bought 15,000 acres of dewatered ditched coastal north Carolina picosan wetland

**[00:38:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> restore it and now our project is delayed for until mid-June because we have one of the only red wolf litters on the planet that's taken up residency on our this property which is a really wonderful problem to have but you know nothing wrong with delaying the restoration of hydrology in this large acreage for a couple weeks so yeah yeah there's that and then uh we we got invited to albania to look at the coastal well a couple things um our illustrious president and his family walked into albania i don't think he had a direct hand uh and they they basically said we want to do a big resort here but the national park is in the way and they changed the boundary of a dedicated national park

**[00:39:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> give that family access to prime national park land.

**[00:39:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So we're doing a project with architect Jeanne Gang, Studio Gang in Chicago, a MacArthur fellow that's leveraging a different way to enforce a national reserve.

**[00:39:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> We're not going to call it a national park.

**[00:39:25] SteveApfelbaum**
> So working on a project like that and just a whole bunch of projects.

**[00:39:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Northern Great Plains adaptive multi-pedal grazing study is finding out the same things that we published and you saw in the Soil Carbon Cowboys movie movies or videos.

**[00:39:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> A bunch of so many things.

**[00:39:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's just so exciting.

**[00:39:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Steve, as I understand it, Applied Ecological Services is now a part of RES, whatever that is.

**[00:39:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it still your base of operations or is this?

**[00:39:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> No.

**[00:40:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, I in 2021 I merged applied ecological services about just under 400 staff and 19 offices into REZ and I made a commitment to stand board for two years and after one year the the non-profit work was so exciting and overwhelmingly drawing me that I retired and set up the institute and where I now call home is we my wife and I and four others bought a country club and converted it into a place called the Three Waters Reserve and it's a public a public park that we restored hired the university was constant executive chef and he runs the food and beverage service and so my bit my my office is the basement

**[00:41:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> That used to be the pro shop in the golf course.

**[00:41:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's now a field station for training You know new we call it baby colleges that grow into adult ecologists and my wife Susan Lenhart and others are behind the educational programming and you know foisting that upon the world with wonderful interns that have amazing epiphanies by working in the field of restoration and Measurement and so forth So is this the Institute for Applied Ecology that you're talking about?

**[00:41:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, that it's the applied ecological Institute The Institute can you give us a URL?

**[00:41:47] SteveApfelbaum**
> I got it here.

**[00:41:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> E Institute org.

**[00:41:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah Yeah, I think the Institute for Applied Ecology is in Milbrook New York.

**[00:41:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, it's in Corvallis, Oregon Which is oh, that's right.

**[00:41:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's right.

**[00:41:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay

**[00:42:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, yeah, you know, we have a slogan in the era, we say, what can we all do together that we can't do individually, but and we'll pursue that question in a moment, but you seem to be doing it all individually, although I'm beginning to think that at this point, you've got an army behind you.

**[00:42:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not, it's not as big of a wonderful group of a family of, you know, staff and partners that I used to have.

**[00:42:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's greatly reduced and very focused on a couple of things, although it doesn't sound like it probably is based on what I just told you.

**[00:42:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's based on doing projects on the ground that inform stratifyx, which is the software app, and it's based on doing projects on the ground that that really serve as pilots and demos of take.

**[00:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> on the major challenges.

**[00:43:01] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's what we're doing.

**[00:43:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> And trying to nail the science and nail the communication and, you know, the art.

**[00:43:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> So Peter Bick, the film producer, working with us, we're working together on the grazing stuff and the on the climate food stuff.

**[00:43:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've got another whole team of communicators that are working on on that and regenerative ag.

**[00:43:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's so many wonderful people.

**[00:43:31] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's not a it's not all under one.

**[00:43:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's it's a wonderful growing team.

**[00:43:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you asked a specific question, which is one that we've been thrashing about ever since we started, which is, how do we somehow get more and more people to understand, you know, that this is this is the most exciting thing about being alive in this particular universe, as far as we know, that

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The future is at stake, and for the coming generation, there's really nothing.

**[00:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There's no better prescription for good life than to get on and say, I have the opportunity to save the future.

**[00:44:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But to do that, they have to understand that it's true and that they really can make a difference.

**[00:44:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so how do you get the word out?

**[00:44:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're doing education, I gather, at several different levels.

**[00:44:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I saw that Mike had a comment a bit a few minutes ago.

**[00:44:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Mike, do you want to introduce yourself since you came in a little bit late?

**[00:44:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then also start the discussion about how we can help amplify the kind of work that Steve is doing and that we're all trying to do.

**[00:44:46] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I apologize.

**[00:44:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> I wasn't following the chat.

**[00:44:50] SteveApfelbaum**
> was trying to...

**[00:44:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, that's okay.

**[00:44:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> If there's questions.

**[00:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys.

**[00:44:56] Mike Lynn**

> Thank you, John.

**[00:44:57] Mike Lynn**
> I apologize, everybody, for coming in late.

**[00:45:00] Mike Lynn**
> But yeah, you had mentioned you had asked the question is there a way that we could get this in front of other people for continuing education As far as at the academic level, I'm not sure but I know there are institutions that offer Training such as the things like you mentioned Matter of fact, I'm doing one for an organization next month on living shorelines that The people that attend are typically engineers Landscape architects because they come to here for whether it's an hour long to our long full day long And then they get their professional accreditation continuing education hours.

**[00:45:34] Mike Lynn**
> So that might be one avenue.

**[00:45:36] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's helpful for you to pursue Yeah, we we've been doing that for years with with ASLA and with the the engineering You know groups as well and doing soil bioengineering and the whole range a lot of mine reclamation a lot of river My professor was lonely appalled and river physics and hydrology

**[00:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> been teaching that and but how do you there's so many opportunities how do you build a team around the opportunities and then divide and conquer is what I'm trying to figure out and I've learned a few things you know I thought it was holy as a scientist to get you know 300 people to review a paper and Peter Peter Big it's 600,000 website hits a month on the the the grazing videos now 17 million hits so far in in like 113 countries I can't believe it I mean why do we do science papers why do we write videos seem to be so incredibly you know good interesting yeah so um

**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just want to tag a few future conversations I'd like to have with you and what we shouldn't take at the time.

**[00:47:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have, as you may know, I now know I should send it to you, a project cooking in Panama, where we've said the watershed is a strategic global importance, and that the drought from recent years had such a huge financial impact that it's a really interesting laboratory and demonstration site for trying to show that you can fix climate by fixing ecosystems.

**[00:47:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we're just beginning to get some action on the ground.

**[00:47:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We imagine that when we do that, we're going to have to mobilize lots of people to come up with solutions that better their lives and improve, have measurable impact on local climate and perhaps regional climate.

**[00:47:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it sounds like your software and your expertise might really fit in very well there, so I'll follow up with you on that.

**[00:48:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've done several projects in South America and Costa Rica that have been watershed based restoration projects that we talk about and a bunch of a bunch in North America as well.

**[00:48:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right.

**[00:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The other thing I'll mention is my own answer to the question of how do we engage young people?

**[00:48:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben and I have talked about this a lot.

**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think every school and every university on the planet has got too much pavement, too much parking lots, too much grass, not enough native species.

**[00:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lots and lots of students who are desperate to do something meaningful about the future they're told is coming and probably alumni who would like to give money for a named Miyawaki Forest or another project of that sort.

**[00:48:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would become an outdoor living laboratory and create not just a patch of research.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> stored land, but a cohort of ecosystem restores who know what to do and can fan away from their schools and get it going.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Quaqui Wildcat, one of our ERA members, and I are talking about trying to get something along these lines going, but that recipe, whether it's Miyawaki Forest or some other school-based program, I think should be part of everybody's curriculum.

**[00:49:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I don't know quite a few schools over the years.

**[00:49:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> example, we talked about Seneca Falls a little while ago, John, right in your neighborhood.

**[00:49:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> To do the 1,000-acre Seneca Meadows restoration project around Seneca Falls there, we hired high school students and they collected with us native plant species seeds for prairie wetland savanna.

**[00:50:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> a forest from about a about a 30 mile radius.

**[00:50:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then we paid students and we made flats, soil, and seeds available and instructions.

**[00:50:17] SteveApfelbaum**
> And they grew the plants.

**[00:50:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> then for that restoration, we bought plants back with one stipulation that they had to come back with somebody, a relative, a parent, a friend, and plant the plant materials with us.

**[00:50:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And we've done that.

**[00:50:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did that on several mining projects, the Flambeau Mine up in Lady Smith, Wisconsin, and the Jackson County Iron Mine in Black River Falls, starting in the in the mid 80s.

**[00:50:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> And now they're public parks now, these magnificent large landscapes.

**[00:50:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've created durable relationships through that mechanism with the with the community.

**[00:51:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> these because now that the families come back to see the plants, they think they planted 20 years ago.

**[00:51:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really wonderful.

**[00:51:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interesting.

**[00:51:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And where are the stories told about these programs that we all agree should be replicated to tools all over the world?

**[00:51:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Seneca Falls story is told in the Audubon Nature Center there at the Seneca Meadows preserve right south of Rochester.

**[00:51:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the stories about Flambomine is told, you can go on the Rio Tinto website, they're so proud of it.

**[00:51:39] SteveApfelbaum**
> The Wisconsin DNR tells the story about those mining projects because instead of planting it with non-native or alfalfa, which is what was originally intended, we planted them with native vegetation, prairies and savanna vegetation, they're fantastic.

**[00:52:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> They just, who are just wildlife areas now, and recreation areas.

**[00:52:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I predict Ben Rubin and I are going to go to the Seneca, what's it called again?

**[00:52:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> Well it's, it's the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:16] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's right on the Seneca Meadows Preserve.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[00:52:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:52:19] SteveApfelbaum**
> You guys are 45 minutes from there, or something like that.

**[00:52:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is pretty darn close.

**[00:52:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:52:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[00:52:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Steve, welcome.

**[00:52:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome.

**[00:52:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:52:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Steve, it's, it's, it's an amazing, it's work.

**[00:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see you're still going strong.

**[00:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we salute you.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> A couple.

**[00:52:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> thank you.

**[00:52:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's an honor.

**[00:52:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, go for it, Natalie.

**[00:52:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, a couple thoughts.

**[00:52:46] Natalie Fleming**
> me, the big change to get, to get people engaged, when you focus on CO2, it's pretty depressing.

**[00:52:52] Natalie Fleming**
> But if, when you focus on the assistive restoration, you can really tie it to breaking the flood drought fire cycle.

**[00:53:01] Natalie Fleming**
> The CO2 focus, CO2 centrism is to me very depressing and slow moving, but eco-restoration is pretty dramatic and powerful.

**[00:53:14] Natalie Fleming**
> There's some fun things that we can do to teach people about climate and ecosystems and, I don't know, to me paragliding.

**[00:53:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I know this sounds crazy, but you talk about peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:25] Natalie Fleming**
> Paragliders, they fly.

**[00:53:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'm a pilot.

**[00:53:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> Parasailers, parasailers, they fly and they don't wait for peer-reviewed articles.

**[00:53:36] Natalie Fleming**
> Right.

**[00:53:37] Natalie Fleming**
> They just get out there and do it and their life depends on understanding microclimates and how the landscape relates to the climate.

**[00:53:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And I do have a picture, I pulled up a slide on where I was down in Utah and they have a spot there, so I didn't actually fly, but they let me play with a kite for a little while.

**[00:53:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Not that crazy yet, but eventually I'll get there.

**[00:54:00] Natalie Fleming**
> I think that focusing on eco restoration over CO2 centrism in the water cycle, focus on the water cycle.

**[00:54:07] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a dramatic difference and it gets people excited because you can make a difference and you can make an immediate change.

**[00:54:13] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's, I think the CO2 is so depressing that people can't get past it and they don't feel like they can really do much about it.

**[00:54:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, we've learned that people are barren by trees because they can see it, see a tree and they don't understand soil carbon.

**[00:54:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's, you know, there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> And there's more peat carbon on the planet than all the soil carbon and all the tree carbon on the planet.

**[00:54:41] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we've been focusing on is peat and soil carbon projects first and forestry carbons less so.

**[00:54:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I'm a pilot and I'm what's incredible is how violent the winds and the turbulence are now.

**[00:55:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> compared to what they were over the years that I've been flying about 25 or 30 years.

**[00:55:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there are major changes that are occurring that I feel every time I get in the airplane, most every time.

**[00:55:13] SteveApfelbaum**
> So it's very, very frightening to think about flying under some of the conditions that now as a pilot where, you you take off in one place and the prediction isn't quite what it might be projected to be when you're trying to land somewhere.

**[00:55:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[00:55:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant, you have a comment and an observation.

**[00:55:39] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:55:41] sustainavistas**
> I think if we look at the process, mean, first it's not really trees or soil or carbon.

**[00:55:48] sustainavistas**
> I think we're generally talking about changing behavior.

**[00:55:54] sustainavistas**
> And something I'd like to point to, I think Joe has probably a time for us to maybe

**[00:56:00] sustainavistas**
> for me to jump on on and give an update, because we've, so see, we are the founder of my ecological founder of our group, Courtney of Balmeneu, which is more trees now in Dutch, started 14 years ago by himself for about the first five years, challenging the local council.

**[00:56:18] sustainavistas**
> So we just outside Amsterdam Schupper Airport in probably one of the densest population urban areas.

**[00:56:26] sustainavistas**
> And in the Netherlands it started with removing 1000 school tiles and putting, rescuing one tree from a local urban forest and planting that on a thousand schools plains.

**[00:56:39] sustainavistas**
> And that went on for five years and we've now 14 years grown into an organization that's saved, rescued and donated and transplanted in the Netherlands over three million free trees, siblings.

**[00:56:52] sustainavistas**
> 30,000 volunteers and we're now going to six countries, so Belgium, Germany, the UK, Ireland and France, which is

**[00:57:00] sustainavistas**
> last year started a kit of a project with five ecosystem registration communities of John D.

**[00:57:05] sustainavistas**
> Liu in Ireland, sort of Cree, in Vericelle, in France, Recoviva, in Italy, in Spain, we've just come back from Altiplana and also the EFC headquarters and then obviously we're in Dutch base, so we're spending two years developing training and education materials for that.

**[00:57:27] sustainavistas**
> But if you look at what we're doing, I really think we're probably the first organisation, there's one group in France and I'll correct me if I'm wrong in Australia or the USA or Canada or any other countries that they're doing it, but we basically use nature as a nursery and basically because we use 50 centimetre to two metre high trees, that's like our sweet spot, we can do bigger trees, but that's our sweet spot and these are five to 20-year-old settings, so we really

**[00:58:00] sustainavistas**
> starting with a far better base and then in the temperate north we actually rescue and save and our survival rate is 70 to 80 percent so and it's a free resource so we do about 150 species in the Netherlands and I think that so twice it's really mass participation of communities connecting people to nature and showing them an ecological solution as well as people can actually really scale so I mean this is probably one of the most incredible scalable solutions that's and and and so we would love people we if you look at our more trees now dot eco website we've got a whole communication toolkit we show our manuals our hands everything we've translated four languages but also we give it all away for nothing so have a look at that and I think it could be interesting to use that because if you can I mean we in the winter in our little area near airport skipway airport our biggest tree have we risked 140 000 trees and gave them away for free if we and that's any

**[00:59:00] sustainavistas**
> every day, every day for six months, 10, 20 year volunteers working on it, but if we got paid people, we got thousands of people to do this, and we could do it in 20 or 30 countries, we basically could really ramp up the carbon sequestration, but also change behavior, basically, and really.

**[00:59:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:59:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Grant, you have reminded me that it is indeed time for an update from you.

**[00:59:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll follow up for a report.

**[00:59:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you're right.

**[00:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You have a solution which has scaled and rallied tens of thousands of people.

**[00:59:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We really are in a planet with 8 billion.

**[00:59:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let's see how we can scale that up and then we spread the word.

**[00:59:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> think replicable models is really what we're all looking for in transferability to other systems.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yep.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Exactly.

**[00:59:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you.

**[00:59:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> And you're in the Netherlands.

**[00:59:55] SteveApfelbaum**
> Did I hear that right?

**[00:59:56] sustainavistas**
> Yeah.

**[00:59:57] sustainavistas**
> I'm actually looking...

**[01:00:00] sustainavistas**
> My son is, I'm actually in Canada, Quebec for a week, I'm actually looking at starting some trials up in Canada because I've just become a grandparent, so we'll be coming to Canada two or three times a year probably.

**[01:00:12] sustainavistas**
> So our first grandchild was just born in Montreal 19 days ago, so yeah, so I'm actually on a 20 hectare property, so I think this might be one of the first treehouses in Canada.

**[01:00:26] sustainavistas**
> So yeah, let's not take too much more time, but I think let's have a conversation in parallel.

**[01:00:37] sustainavistas**
> One other quick question to the group in order to join, do you know any members that are going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Going to change now in Paris next week?

**[01:00:47] sustainavistas**
> No, I do not.

**[01:00:48] sustainavistas**
> Okay, I'll put that in the email tomorrow, but if you can't follow that, it's probably often New York and London climate week is probably one of the highest profiles, about 40,000.

**[01:01:00] sustainavistas**
> And people go to Paris for three days and it's a really an epic event and a lot of submissions that got a lot of those solutions there and ecosystem restoration is a real big, okay, thanks guys.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:01:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thank you, Brett.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, great.

**[01:01:14] SteveApfelbaum**
> It sounds like a way to think about transferability of the, you know, the, the.

**[01:01:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> How you change the behavior and less so what you're planning and unless that's critical, but to work across different ecosystems, that'd be great.

**[01:01:32] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, exactly.

**[01:01:33] sustainavistas**
> I mean, for example, one of the small projects, sorry, John, just we start, we kicked off this year, we did an eco fitness.

**[01:01:38] sustainavistas**
> So basically, not only working on the ecological fitness of the forest and the land, but we also work on the fitness and the health and mental fitness people at the same time.

**[01:01:47] sustainavistas**
> So we kick sort of that off this year.

**[01:01:49] sustainavistas**
> So there's some videos on that.

**[01:01:50] sustainavistas**
> That's why it was a bit of fun, but actually we have to pick it up.

**[01:01:53] sustainavistas**
> So we work from November to March for the trees at the moment.

**[01:01:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's basically our model.

**[01:01:57] sustainavistas**
> That's great.

**[01:01:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:01:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:02:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie, you just switched off your camera, but I'm hoping this is your moment to give us your presentation.

**[01:02:08] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, my friend just came out to see if I wanted some chicken that's a little bit too spicy for me.

**[01:02:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And to see if the kids in the dog can come out and play.

**[01:02:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, did you just say you wanted me to do the presentation now?

**[01:02:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I did.

**[01:02:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I did.

**[01:02:22] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, hopefully I don't start coughing like a crazy one.

**[01:02:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:02:27] Natalie Fleming**
> So, if you've followed me at all on LinkedIn, you know that I obsessed about the water cycle.

**[01:02:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think all problems I'll call every all the problems and ecosystems are caused by bare grounds and bare ground and lack of life.

**[01:02:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I blame everything on the desert and I blame everything on mineral dust just so you know just about.

**[01:02:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I had the opportunity to spend the winter in Salt Lake and it was pretty exciting for me to go back to Salt Lake.

**[01:02:58] Natalie Fleming**
> It is kind of the land of my children.

**[01:03:00] Natalie Fleming**
> sensitivity.

**[01:03:02] Natalie Fleming**
> When I started out in life, lived in the Utah Valley along the Wasatch Front.

**[01:03:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And if you've been paying attention, they have a terrible crisis now where they have the great drought.

**[01:03:14] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I first got down there in October, I was able to stay on Mount Olympus.

**[01:03:21] Natalie Fleming**
> I spent 40 days and 40 nights on Mount Olympus looking over the valley and it was absolutely beautiful.

**[01:03:29] Natalie Fleming**
> This picture right here is from there.

**[01:03:32] Natalie Fleming**
> on the mountain side, it has a beautiful forest on the mountain side.

**[01:03:39] Natalie Fleming**
> If you're not familiar with the landscaping of the Great Salt Lake, you've got, as the winds come in from the west, you've got a lot of bare ground.

**[01:03:48] Natalie Fleming**
> You have the salt flats, you have the Great Salt Lake, and then you have these massive huge, I should have written down the exact height of the mountains and to Mount Tipinogus and all these Mount Olympus, they're huge.

**[01:04:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> or gargantuan.

**[01:04:02] Natalie Fleming**
> And these mountains are amazing because they really trap in, they have the potential to trap in the moisture.

**[01:04:09] Natalie Fleming**
> But they have been denuding and ripping landscaping and plants out over the last 20 or 30 years.

**[01:04:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And when I was there 30 years ago, there were orchards and lawns and conifers and deciduous.

**[01:04:27] Natalie Fleming**
> There were all manner of life was there.

**[01:04:30] Natalie Fleming**
> And because the community is trapped between the mountain and the lake, there's very little room for growth.

**[01:04:38] Natalie Fleming**
> And so they've been denuding it.

**[01:04:41] Natalie Fleming**
> as strangely, the rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:45] Natalie Fleming**
> Thanks.

**[01:04:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I'm going to try this chicken in a minute.

**[01:04:49] Natalie Fleming**
> The rain stopped coming.

**[01:04:52] Natalie Fleming**
> so the solution was to denude the earth some more and rip out more trees and grasses and shrubs.

**[01:04:58] Natalie Fleming**
> And after a minute,

**[01:05:00] Natalie Fleming**
> official of the neighbors.

**[01:05:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Sorry, those are some domesticated teenagers.

**[01:05:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Just a second here.

**[01:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're not hearing much of your background.

**[01:05:18] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, I can hear it.

**[01:05:19] Natalie Fleming**
> I was screaming at him.

**[01:05:22] Natalie Fleming**
> It's a subdivision here.

**[01:05:24] Natalie Fleming**
> There's a full neighborhood going on.

**[01:05:26] Natalie Fleming**
> So they've been denuding the earth and ripping out landscaping and trees.

**[01:05:31] Natalie Fleming**
> The cities have been paying people to rip out vegetation in order to save the water.

**[01:05:40] Natalie Fleming**
> The Great Salt Lake strike team, and their plan to save the lake is to direct all water from the watershed directly to the lake and skip any vegetation in the landscape along the way.

**[01:05:55] Natalie Fleming**
> So I found out three hours ago I'd be doing this presentation.

**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So can I can I share?

**[01:06:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes please.

**[01:06:03] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay so um desktop one you're going to see all my stuff here all the kids um here is a video I wasn't able to export this video to the right format so uh this is the rocks that they are landscaping with now there used to be vegetation here and ripped it out in order to not use water their focus is is stopping water usage they don't understand the water cycle not used so they put in this rock landscaping and you can hear the highway this is the landscaping that they've put in and while I was driving around the valley I would stop and take pictures and videos as I went along and I was just horrified so you see these rocks we see the tree above ahead um this is a you know you're looking at a quarter mile of rocks and as I step into the trees you're going to see what they ripped out to save water

**[01:07:01] Natalie Fleming**
> And you're going to see, you know, six foot tall grasses, trees, shrubs, and a little small riparian area.

**[01:07:08] Natalie Fleming**
> I had the sound on, you would hear the birds chirping.

**[01:07:12] Natalie Fleming**
> And this whole area is next to the lake.

**[01:07:16] Natalie Fleming**
> It's between the lake and Jordan River.

**[01:07:18] Natalie Fleming**
> And they ripped down all this vegetation.

**[01:07:21] Natalie Fleming**
> And I have videos of the machines continuing to rip out more and more vegetation.

**[01:07:25] Natalie Fleming**
> There is very little of this left.

**[01:07:29] Natalie Fleming**
> So this is, of course, a month ago.

**[01:07:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So the spring hasn't come yet.

**[01:07:33] Natalie Fleming**
> I should probably go back in a month when it's all green.

**[01:07:38] Natalie Fleming**
> But they've just ripped this all out and the soil was rich and thick and soft and moist.

**[01:07:45] Natalie Fleming**
> And these are the tall pompous grass that they have.

**[01:07:47] Natalie Fleming**
> And they're ripping this out to save the water and to conserve water, because this is obviously using water.

**[01:07:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And they don't even understand that water is not used, water is cycled.

**[01:08:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, um, it's pretty horrific.

**[01:08:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, sorry, let's put that over here.

**[01:08:05] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> Let's see.

**[01:08:06] Natalie Fleming**
> How are we going to go to slide show, uh, please start.

**[01:08:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:13] Natalie Fleming**
> So I threw this together real quick.

**[01:08:15] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, there's a picture.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> The great.

**[01:08:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it is a shrunk exponentially.

**[01:08:21] Natalie Fleming**
> How do I go to the next?

**[01:08:23] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay.

**[01:08:24] Natalie Fleming**
> Um, I gotta move you guys over where I can't see you anymore.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> I think.

**[01:08:28] Natalie Fleming**
> Because you're, I can't say anything.

**[01:08:30] Natalie Fleming**
> Okay, there we go.

**[01:08:31] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's in the 1980s.

**[01:08:33] Natalie Fleming**
> was about 3000 square miles.

**[01:08:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And now it's down to 150.

**[01:08:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So it's down to less than a third of what it was before.

**[01:08:40] Natalie Fleming**
> And as the lake shrinks, um, they've got some serious problems.

**[01:08:48] Natalie Fleming**
> One of the next to the lake, this is I, I am LDS and we build chapels everywhere and under advisement of the local community.

**[01:08:57] Natalie Fleming**
> They were advised to landscape in this manner.

**[01:09:00] Natalie Fleming**
> To use rocks and I compare using rocks as landscaping as using skulls and bones to landscape rocks are the are the skull.

**[01:09:08] Natalie Fleming**
> They're the structure of the earth and the soil and the trees.

**[01:09:12] Natalie Fleming**
> That is the flesh of the earth.

**[01:09:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So imagine just ripping the flesh off of your arm, which is grotesque and expecting the blood to flow and it's not flowing.

**[01:09:20] Natalie Fleming**
> So we know from Zach wise and water stories about Lancaster and all these wonderful people that you're supposed to sink slow and spread the water and then get as much vegetation as you can out of it to get the body pump going.

**[01:09:33] Natalie Fleming**
> And as you can see this particular structure, they've done the opposite.

**[01:09:38] Natalie Fleming**
> The tall this next right next to this was seven foot tall pompous grass that was ripped out and this is right.

**[01:09:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is Lakefront property.

**[01:09:46] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was water conservation gone wrong.

**[01:09:50] Natalie Fleming**
> If we do not have plants, you're not going to have rain.

**[01:09:54] Natalie Fleming**
> lot of people think the plants come because of the rain, but it's just like the chicken and the egg.

**[01:10:00] Natalie Fleming**
> to have vegetation and plants and great soil to keep the biotic pump going.

**[01:10:04] Natalie Fleming**
> I need to explain the bi...

**[01:10:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I can't let me put you back up there.

**[01:10:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I don't think you do actually.

**[01:10:09] Natalie Fleming**
> I do it.

**[01:10:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Everybody here gets it.

**[01:10:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Okay.

**[01:10:11] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:10:12] Natalie Fleming**
> can skip, so I don't have to explain the biotic pump.

**[01:10:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I can do that, but I think you guys are all versed in it.

**[01:10:19] Natalie Fleming**
> So the water cycle is completely biological in line out.

**[01:10:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And it's transpiration as an engine.

**[01:10:27] Natalie Fleming**
> so you all know about Pseudonose, Miserengi, and other mushroom spores and pollens that cloud seed at warm temperatures.

**[01:10:36] Natalie Fleming**
> So I don't need to explain that to you.

**[01:10:38] Natalie Fleming**
> So all of this, you already know?

**[01:10:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I think we are, we're here because we all share the same basic understanding.

**[01:10:48] Natalie Fleming**
> So here is the view from the place I was initially staying at.

**[01:10:51] Natalie Fleming**
> it's just beautiful, these mountains, and there's a great biodiversity of trees.

**[01:10:55] Natalie Fleming**
> And my plan for the Great Salt Lake would be to harvest all of the seeds,

**[01:11:00] Natalie Fleming**
> on this and set up nurseries and the mountains on the other side of the valley are barren.

**[01:11:06] Natalie Fleming**
> And so if we took the trees and expanded the forestry system, but they're cutting down trees, they're cutting down conifers because they all use water.

**[01:11:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So it was very heartbreaking to see.

**[01:11:20] Natalie Fleming**
> the ancient Amazonians, they used the mountains to their advantage to trap in the as the clouds came in, as the moisture came in, they created water retention landscapes and built structures to really maximize vegetation and trap the water in.

**[01:11:35] Natalie Fleming**
> the Great Salt Lake in the Wasatch Front, that area has a great advantage with that great mountain that could trap in an incredible amount of water.

**[01:11:44] Natalie Fleming**
> This is what I saw everywhere where by mandate the trees, the homes were built with rock landscaping, which to me is kind of like Terminator where they're walking on the skulls.

**[01:11:56] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the bones of the earth.

**[01:12:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Can you explain to you how and why?

**[01:12:02] Natalie Fleming**
> they're just directoring all vegetation over.

**[01:12:05] Natalie Fleming**
> then the lake has the lake bed because it does not drain anywhere else.

**[01:12:12] Natalie Fleming**
> It has a lot of arsenic lead in mercury and selenium that as it dries out, it's kicking that dust.

**[01:12:19] Natalie Fleming**
> And the ice nucleating temperatures of that dust, meaning its rainfall potential is very, very low.

**[01:12:25] Natalie Fleming**
> It has to be super, super, super cold in order for it to stimulate rainfall.

**[01:12:28] Natalie Fleming**
> So that's super bad.

**[01:12:32] Natalie Fleming**
> It was super depressing for me to see this because when I left, there were orchards and herds and all sorts of things.

**[01:12:38] Natalie Fleming**
> this unleashing pollutants, there's a health crisis because of the asthma and heart disease.

**[01:12:43] Natalie Fleming**
> You've got arsenic in the air.

**[01:12:46] Natalie Fleming**
> They've convinced a lot of local farmers to redirect water from the farm to the lake.

**[01:12:53] Natalie Fleming**
> And they think it's gonna help.

**[01:12:54] Natalie Fleming**
> So you already know what temperature, okay, don't need to give you that.

**[01:12:59] Natalie Fleming**
> All right.

**[01:13:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, this is a view, a picture I took this winter when the snow was there and you can see that from the side of the mountain, you can see the clouds forming and rumbling on this side.

**[01:13:12] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on that.

**[01:13:14] Natalie Fleming**
> I don't need to lecture you on any of this.

**[01:13:17] Natalie Fleming**
> So, on the right is a picture of what I, I took both these pictures.

**[01:13:22] Natalie Fleming**
> These were side by side.

**[01:13:24] Natalie Fleming**
> And on the right, this is along a riverbed, the Jordan River.

**[01:13:28] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping out massive amounts.

**[01:13:30] Natalie Fleming**
> I could show you the whole video of them piling up the dirt and shipping it off and then saying, we're having a drought.

**[01:13:36] Natalie Fleming**
> I just don't know why.

**[01:13:37] Natalie Fleming**
> if they, yeah, I don't know the polite way to tell them they're all stupid.

**[01:13:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> Natalie, did you see any good examples of landscaping that might be nothing at all?

**[01:13:53] Natalie Fleming**
> They were ripping everything out that they consider the rock landscaping is good.

**[01:13:57] Natalie Fleming**
> This right here.

**[01:13:58] Natalie Fleming**
> This isn't Saratoga Springs.

**[01:14:00] Natalie Fleming**
> If you look closely, those are logs.

**[01:14:02] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the only trees I found in that area when I was driving all of that particular area.

**[01:14:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Those are the logs.

**[01:14:10] Natalie Fleming**
> They were building new subdivisions.

**[01:14:11] Natalie Fleming**
> They're building massive, massive subdivisions and they obviously they cut down some tree.

**[01:14:17] Natalie Fleming**
> But the focus is that that uses water.

**[01:14:20] Natalie Fleming**
> They're really obsessed with removing anything that uses water.

**[01:14:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Natalie, do you talk, do you give this presentation in Salt Lake City?

**[01:14:33] Natalie Fleming**
> No, I made this presentation an hour ago for tonight.

**[01:14:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you?

**[01:14:38] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact these people.

**[01:14:40] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email address.

**[01:14:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I tried to contact Brian Stede.

**[01:14:43] Natalie Fleming**
> He is at the University of Utah.

**[01:14:46] Natalie Fleming**
> I got a really good reference person, really top notch person.

**[01:14:49] Natalie Fleming**
> He me the reference.

**[01:14:50] Natalie Fleming**
> He didn't really return the calls.

**[01:14:52] Natalie Fleming**
> I do have the email addresses of everybody on the right team.

**[01:14:55] Natalie Fleming**
> everybody, I don't know how to approach them without being a jerk, really, without telling them they're.

**[01:15:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Scrooming things up because who am I and they're hydrologists and geologists and all these.

**[01:15:05] Natalie Fleming**
> These are university hydrologists, but PhDs and post PhDs and teach at the university and who am I to go and tell them they're.

**[01:15:12] SteveApfelbaum**
> You know, the, the LDS church, we worked on the city creek.

**[01:15:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Um, the, uh, the mall, we were the folks that brought.

**[01:15:22] SteveApfelbaum**
> Uh, city creek to the surface that runs to the mall.

**[01:15:27] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the, the for profit arm.

**[01:15:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> And the foundation arm of the Mormon church.

**[01:15:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, very focused on the water desert ranch million acre ranch.

**[01:15:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're trying to figure out how to, you know, I wonder if the LDS angle rather than.

**[01:15:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> Going to the city would be worth doing.

**[01:15:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> then the other angle is, um, we're working with the CEO of, uh, who bought big power mountain.

**[01:16:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's 20,000 acres.

**[01:16:02] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's really interested in setting a regional example of how to restore the water cycle.

**[01:16:09] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was really trying to get to eco of the ag reserves, which is the for business entity.

**[01:16:16] Natalie Fleming**
> And I was unable to break through and I am LDS and I've talked to my bishop.

**[01:16:22] Natalie Fleming**
> said, who do I talk to other than embarrass the church on LinkedIn, which I did.

**[01:16:27] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, maybe you can help me if you have the contacts.

**[01:16:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Send me an email and I'll see if the contacts are still viable.

**[01:16:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because we worked with them for six or seven years.

**[01:16:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I lived in Roosevelt, Utah and became very close with leaders in the church.

**[01:16:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> Because there's so many Jack Mormons and Roosevelt, they were afraid they were going to lose the tribe out there.

**[01:16:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So he even went after little Jewish boys like me to indoctrinate us.

**[01:17:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Just so you know, Jack Mormons are Mormons that don't quite abide.

**[01:17:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> No, I know that.

**[01:17:06] Natalie Fleming**
> I know that.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Oh, I know.

**[01:17:07] Natalie Fleming**
> I just saw everybody else listening.

**[01:17:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:10] Natalie Fleming**
> I know what a Jack Mormon is.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah.

**[01:17:12] Natalie Fleming**
> You're from the mountainside.

**[01:17:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So when I was there for the first month, I didn't understand why the lake was shrinking because I didn't actually go through the valley the first month.

**[01:17:20] Natalie Fleming**
> And so I've got some great shots.

**[01:17:21] Natalie Fleming**
> So this was good.

**[01:17:24] Natalie Fleming**
> The landowner actually wanted to clear something.

**[01:17:25] Natalie Fleming**
> So you can see a lot of bare ground that here with this forest, the mountain sides don't have many trees over there.

**[01:17:32] Natalie Fleming**
> And there were certain sides that had more trees.

**[01:17:35] Natalie Fleming**
> So these are the beautiful views that I got to see.

**[01:17:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> And I guess that's the end of that.

**[01:17:38] SteveApfelbaum**
> And those are big fire scars.

**[01:17:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those aren't from logging.

**[01:17:42] SteveApfelbaum**
> Those are wildfire scars from the early 20s and 1910.

**[01:17:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We did the master plan for the open space system for Salt Lake City.

**[01:17:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> And it's really interesting how fires played a big role.

**[01:17:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ranching and early fires.

**[01:18:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, if, if I'll send you my information, if you can help in there, there's several different, I could tell you all the stories of all the ways I tried to get in and try to reach the right people.

**[01:18:12] Natalie Fleming**
> But I do have the list of email address of everybody on the great Salt Lake strike team, but I have hesitated to email them because who is Natalie Fleming to go in and tell them.

**[01:18:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Natalie Fleming is now acquainted with Steve Applebaum, who it turns out has got roots in the area.

**[01:18:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if it is Natalie's diagnosis, roughly correct that they're doing almost exactly the wrong thing if they want to turn this around.

**[01:18:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're desertifying the area and not building capacity for water retention and for in the soil system and for lagging the runoff, the hydrograph.

**[01:18:53] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everything's running off the land so quickly.

**[01:18:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> So yeah, it's the right, it's the right thing, but the church isn't easy to do.

**[01:19:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> to unless you get to the for-profit arm because they're paying for a lot of these problems.

**[01:19:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> They're, you know, the community suffering, the erosion and infrastructure damages are really significantly expensive.

**[01:19:14] Natalie Fleming**
> So I'm pretty distressed because at church they announced that they're going to do this great program to reduce vegetation on all the churches across the world and I want to go to them.

**[01:19:23] Natalie Fleming**
> I know they're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do this and I'm like who do I tell them that because Brigham Young taught us we're supposed to make the earth as a garden of Eden not Mars and that picture there of everything's going dark on me all of a sudden.

**[01:19:40] Natalie Fleming**
> That picture is, it looks like you're looking for the rover on it.

**[01:19:45] Natalie Fleming**
> It's so bad and I really want to sit down with them and say they're going to spend hundreds of millions possibly a billion dollars to do massive eco-destruction believing they're doing the right thing.

**[01:20:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> We'll give Rob Lewis a chance to vent here.

**[01:20:03] Natalie Fleming**
> can see that his head is exploding.

**[01:20:07] Natalie Fleming**
> Go, Rob.

**[01:20:09] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Well, wow, what a great presentation.

**[01:20:12] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> thank you so much for what you're doing and a couple things.

**[01:20:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> One, in terms of who is Natalie Fleming, you may have to go to small groups of people and spread your story.

**[01:20:24] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And then Natalie Fleming will be someone with 100 angry citizens behind her.

**[01:20:28] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> That makes a big difference in whether city officials will listen.

**[01:20:33] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> the main thing I want to mention is when you mentioned the rains disappearing and as he described that situation, I was hearing me on over and over.

**[01:20:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Nicely, the situation he described.

**[01:20:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> He talked about the carrier component and the trigger component.

**[01:20:53] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And the carrier component is the moisture that comes in from a larger system.

**[01:20:58] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> Mediterranean sea in the case of Mediterranean sea.

**[01:21:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> But it sounds like it's the sea in Salt Lake.

**[01:21:07] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> It's Salt Lake that's providing the moisture, and then you have the trigger, which is the vegetation.

**[01:21:16] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So they're reproducing the desertification, as Steve said, but in a particular way, very similar to what Mian was talking about.

**[01:21:26] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> And, of course, it was always kind of assumed that he was referring to situations in Mediterranean climate, and they tended to be coastal situations, but this points to this happening in any kind of climate, and inland.

**[01:21:45] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> So, yeah, my mind is kind of blowing up.

**[01:21:48] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> This is amazing what you're doing, and never doubt yourself.

**[01:21:54] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> I mean, who is Natalie Fleming?

**[01:21:56] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> She's this amazing woman who has figured all this stuff out.

**[01:22:00] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**
> and is just getting a start, start, yeah, please.

**[01:22:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I think he's right, Natalie, you mentioned today that you're thinking about politics, but I actually think that your best path to politics might well be to really say, this is who Natalie Fleming is on this topic.

**[01:22:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's only going to become more and more clear that you were right and that you had the courage to say it.

**[01:22:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it actually, I think, would give you a very distinctive brand as a politician if you led with that.

**[01:22:41] Natalie Fleming**
> And this form of environmentalism is agreeable to both sides, both the left and the right politically.

**[01:22:49] Natalie Fleming**
> But one exciting thing for me is if we can get the LDS church on board is that LDS church has properties all over the world and they have a missionary mindset and they have missionaries all over the world.

**[01:23:00] Natalie Fleming**
> So, and the missionaries are required to put it in a certain number of hours of service in their community, wherever they are.

**[01:23:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And that is non, non, across the lighting service.

**[01:23:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:23:10] Natalie Fleming**
> And so, getting these youth, getting the youth trained before they go on emissions on this stuff.

**[01:23:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is one thing.

**[01:23:17] Natalie Fleming**
> Yeah, go ahead.

**[01:23:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The one thing we can do together that we can't do individually is to have Natalie compare notes with Steve and to Steve see if he can find a way in based on the fact that he.

**[01:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:24:02] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:24:18] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:24:25] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:25:05] Natalie Fleming**

**[01:25:10] SteveApfelbaum**
> Anything that doesn't have the reflectivity, the albedo and the heating capacity and the imperviousness that they're creating would be better and unfortunately lawn is better than what they're doing, but it's not much better.

**[01:25:30] SteveApfelbaum**
> But yeah, we could talk about that further.

**[01:25:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've written a couple of papers on the role of landscapes in water management that might be useful.

**[01:25:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Not on the Jordan River, but we've looked at the changes in river flow over about 100 years and increasing increasing amount of runoff and increasing low flows of increased

**[01:26:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> 400 times over historic low flows and the displaying the river in the Chicago region, median flows have increased if I recall about 250 times on average over historic flows and the high flow events are three to five times the historic high flow flood events.

**[01:26:21] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's in a paper we did with Leopold.

**[01:26:24] SteveApfelbaum**
> So what we're doing is we've flip-flopped the hydrology at the watershed scale from a groundwater recharge and infiltration and very long lag time.

**[01:26:37] SteveApfelbaum**
> The lag is the time period between the center of the mass of the rainfall distribution, the center of the mass of the runoff distribution hydrograph.

**[01:26:48] SteveApfelbaum**
> We've converted recharge-based systems into surface runoff based systems and it's every urban watershed.

**[01:27:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> There's very few that that hasn't happened to, and virtually every agricultural watershed, the same thing has happened.

**[01:27:07] SteveApfelbaum**
> So the story is very well understood, but what's not understood in urban areas, at least in the West, in Salt Lake, a lot of the people there are new customers, and they're interested in high dollar houses with minimal landscaping.

**[01:27:28] SteveApfelbaum**
> And that's part of what the Netflix owner at Big Powder Mountain wants to get across to the people moving into these 20 million dollar homes.

**[01:27:41] Natalie Fleming**
> Well, one of the things that set me is that the church in good faith has donated hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water to go from the farmland to skip the farmland and go direct to the lake.

> Yeah, thank you.

**[01:28:15] Natalie Fleming**
> I would love to speak with you, Steve, if we can get some.

**[01:28:18] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, I'd be glad.

**[01:28:20] SteveApfelbaum**
> So there's some other really critical issues that nobody knows about there, except the FAA, the white pelicans that nest out on, I can't remember the island, Pelican Island is what we called it.

**[01:28:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Now they're feeding at the mouth of the Jordan River and the marshes.

**[01:28:36] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:30:03] Mike Lynn**

> I guess I'd be interested to share this small project.

**[01:35:27] Ben Rubin**
> It's looking at the courtyard space as it's been used and trying to figure out how to find opportunities to bring the students out during all the four seasons.

**[01:35:38] Ben Rubin**
> There is a cherry tree that fruits in the spring, and there's two fig bushes that fruit in the fall.

**[01:36:32] Ben Rubin**

**[01:36:38] Ben Rubin**
> So, we bind sketchbooks.

**[01:36:40] Ben Rubin**
> We use tetrapack containers, which are just recycled mill cartons, you know, K through 12.

**[01:36:46] Ben Rubin**
> The students are involved with, you know, binding these books and then learn, you know, practices for journaling.

**[01:36:56] Ben Rubin**
> I think what's really exciting is

**[01:37:00] Ben Rubin**
> look at how to take some of this stuff outside.

**[01:37:02] Ben Rubin**
> we've done a little bit of that.

**[01:37:04] Ben Rubin**
> Again, these are some of my sketchbooks, in terms of the classroom, you know, just sharing some different ideas that I've had using recycled materials and journaling to kids outside.

**[01:37:25] Ben Rubin**
> This is actually the Cornell webcam with birds.

**[01:37:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's something that we use often in the classroom.

**[01:37:36] Ben Rubin**
> You know, sort of rambling, but yeah, that's really it.

**[01:37:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> What Ben, what did the kids gravitate toward when you take them outside?

**[01:37:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Is there anything that they're really drawn to?

**[01:37:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> it activity like a bird that flies into the view?

**[01:37:55] Ben Rubin**

**[01:38:00] Ben Rubin**

**[01:38:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, hands-on stuff, of course.

**[01:38:06] Ben Rubin**
> I feel like just being outside is, they're inside all day.

**[01:38:14] Ben Rubin**
> Public school is really just marching from one room to the other and sometimes just being able to get a sense of where the sun is in the sky and spending a half an hour outside makes a big difference.

**[01:38:29] Ben Rubin**
> It's this little wall up courtyard.

**[01:38:31] Ben Rubin**
> The school was built by Italian immigrants or it was started with an Italian community a long time ago.

**[01:38:40] Ben Rubin**

**[01:38:41] Ben Rubin**
> There's the figs and the cherries that are from previous generations that most of it is just weeds.

**[01:38:55] Natalie Fleming**
> What I find exciting about your work is

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think something inherent in all of us that about growing food, that that basic thing that we have power over gives you a sense of power for the rest of your life.

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**
> But there's also a sort of a project inspired by that book with these postcards of people from around the world writing messages to, you know, basically migrating peoples.

**[01:40:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned Ben, school is Rochester International Academy.

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is a sanctuary city, controversially this year, of course, and the population is very diverse and includes brand new immigrants, some of them from Afghanistan who incidentally Ben helped bring to Rochester.

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[01:52:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Send me an email or click the link.

**[01:52:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let me know if the link works.

**[01:53:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see you again soon.

**[01:53:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys for the wonderful conversation.

**[01:53:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:53:11] Katie Ross**
> Lovely to see everyone.

**[01:53:12] Katie Ross**
> you.

**[01:53:15] Rob Lewis, northwest Washington, Salish Sea**

**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> in New York about taking nature, taking kids to nature and nature to kids in schools.

**[01:31:10] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'm not jealous.

**[01:31:12] Ben Rubin**
> Looking at, yeah, how to bring some of these, some of the new arrivals to Rochester, go to a special school in the public school system, it's a two-year program where I work.

**[01:31:33] Ben Rubin**
> And it's something where the big focus is on language acquisition.

**[01:31:41] Ben Rubin**
> are largely refugee students coming from conflict areas, but obviously with the political stuff going on, a lot of this is going to change, but it's the program's been around for 13 years.

**[01:31:53] Ben Rubin**
> I've been at the school for three years.

**[01:31:56] Ben Rubin**
> And it's been interesting to try to figure out how to

**[01:32:01] Ben Rubin**
> Have more learning happen outside of the classroom to look at, you know, I teach visual arts.

**[01:32:08] Ben Rubin**
> it's really pretty flexible in terms of.

**[01:32:12] Ben Rubin**
> You know, the curriculum that I bring in, there's a courtyard right next to the classroom.

**[01:32:20] Ben Rubin**
> So I've got a little presentation.

**[01:32:22] Ben Rubin**
> You know, my, my project is literally looking at a very small space in the.

**[01:32:27] Ben Rubin**
> You know, 150 year old school building.

**[01:32:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's pretty small scale, the idea of.

**[01:32:37] Ben Rubin**
> Looking at education and how to transfer some of these larger issues and world challenges into the interest of young students.

**[01:32:52] Ben Rubin**
> I'm seeing if I can share my screen.

**[01:32:57] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see.

**[01:32:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can.

**[01:32:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There you go.

**[01:33:00] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see if this is a hold on a moment.

**[01:33:04] Ben Rubin**
> Okay.

**[01:33:07] Ben Rubin**
> Nope.

**[01:33:09] Ben Rubin**
> Not this one.

**[01:33:10] Ben Rubin**
> Let me see if I can transfer the link over one second.

**[01:33:13] Ben Rubin**
> Apologies.

**[01:33:20] Ben Rubin**
> Do a little bit of digging.

**[01:33:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got the Seneca meadows wetland preserve.

**[01:33:26] Ben Rubin**
> That's right.

**[01:33:27] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah.

**[01:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's snowed this morning here in Rochester, but as soon as the weather gets, as it ought to be, I'm eager to go to Seneca meadows.

**[01:33:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It sounds like it'd be a nice, nice trip.

**[01:33:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben, I do see the, well, I'm just going to bring it over from another window.

**[01:33:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's a cool bird, birding hot spot, John.

**[01:33:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's like the only place you can reliably see American bitterns and clapper rails.

**[01:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really a pretty damn cool place.

**[01:34:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[01:34:07] Ben Rubin**
> Sorry.

**[01:34:10] Ben Rubin**
> Let's try this.

**[01:34:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm pasting my achievements form in here again.

**[01:34:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But Russ and Katie and Michael in particular, you will certainly have a number of things for us to put on our roster of look at all the wonderful things.

**[01:34:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Our network has done.

**[01:34:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can also send me an email, but if you do it this way, it'll save me some time, but I'm happy to go through it.

**[01:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:34:41] Ben Rubin**
> We're looking at your screen, Ben.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**
> Great.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**
> I'll just start at the bottom.

**[01:34:45] Ben Rubin**
> These are just some photos of programs last summer.

**[01:34:50] Ben Rubin**
> Getting some of kids out of the courtyard, coming from all over the world, the idea of just getting them interested in the four seasons that

**[01:35:00] Ben Rubin**
> we have here, including winter and April.

**[01:35:04] Ben Rubin**
> Doing different projects.

**[01:35:06] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see, this one is making bird feeders out of the milk cartons in the lunchroom.

**[01:35:13] Ben Rubin**
> We did planters, leaf tracing, different things.

**[01:35:21] Ben Rubin**
> I guess I'd be interested to share this small project.

**[01:35:27] Ben Rubin**
> It's looking at the courtyard space as it's been used and trying to figure out how to find opportunities to bring the students out during all the four seasons.

**[01:35:38] Ben Rubin**
> There is a cherry tree that fruits in the spring, and there's two fig bushes that fruit in the fall.

**[01:35:48] Ben Rubin**
> So it's nice to sort of have those as bookends.

**[01:35:50] Ben Rubin**
> just to give a small window into what's outside my window.

**[01:35:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the cherry tree.

**[01:35:59] Ben Rubin**
> One of the things.

**[01:36:00] Ben Rubin**
> is that is is a big focus for me.

**[01:36:02] Ben Rubin**
> I teach K through 12.

**[01:36:04] Ben Rubin**
> So, you know, my day is kind of this developmental bender of starting out with five year olds and ending with, you know, sometimes 21 year olds.

**[01:36:13] Ben Rubin**
> I've been looking at, let's see, I can share some of this.

**[01:36:17] Ben Rubin**
> I keep the sketchbook.

**[01:36:19] Ben Rubin**
> That's kind of my main artistic practice.

**[01:36:22] Ben Rubin**
> are some sketchbook notes that I've taken doing different educational programs here in upstate New York.

**[01:36:32] Ben Rubin**
> The students also, I think, really benefit from that practice.

**[01:36:38] Ben Rubin**
> So, we bind sketchbooks.

**[01:36:40] Ben Rubin**
> We use tetrapack containers, which are just recycled mill cartons, you know, K through 12.

**[01:36:46] Ben Rubin**
> The students are involved with, you know, binding these books and then learn, you know, practices for journaling.

**[01:36:56] Ben Rubin**
> I think what's really exciting is

**[01:37:00] Ben Rubin**
> look at how to take some of this stuff outside.

**[01:37:02] Ben Rubin**
> we've done a little bit of that.

**[01:37:04] Ben Rubin**
> Again, these are some of my sketchbooks, in terms of the classroom, you know, just sharing some different ideas that I've had using recycled materials and journaling to kids outside.

**[01:37:25] Ben Rubin**
> This is actually the Cornell webcam with birds.

**[01:37:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's something that we use often in the classroom.

**[01:37:36] Ben Rubin**
> You know, sort of rambling, but yeah, that's really it.

**[01:37:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> What Ben, what did the kids gravitate toward when you take them outside?

**[01:37:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Is there anything that they're really drawn to?

**[01:37:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> it activity like a bird that flies into the view?

**[01:37:55] Ben Rubin**
> What draws them?

**[01:37:57] Ben Rubin**
> You know, being able to take

**[01:38:00] Ben Rubin**
> things or trace things.

**[01:38:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, hands-on stuff, of course.

**[01:38:06] Ben Rubin**
> I feel like just being outside is, they're inside all day.

**[01:38:14] Ben Rubin**
> Public school is really just marching from one room to the other and sometimes just being able to get a sense of where the sun is in the sky and spending a half an hour outside makes a big difference.

**[01:38:29] Ben Rubin**
> It's this little wall up courtyard.

**[01:38:31] Ben Rubin**
> The school was built by Italian immigrants or it was started with an Italian community a long time ago.

**[01:38:40] Ben Rubin**
> So there's some of this stuff.

**[01:38:41] Ben Rubin**
> There's the figs and the cherries that are from previous generations that most of it is just weeds.

**[01:38:55] Natalie Fleming**
> What I find exciting about your work is

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think something inherent in all of us that about growing food, that that basic thing that we have power over gives you a sense of power for the rest of your life.

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**
> But there's also a sort of a project inspired by that book with these postcards of people from around the world writing messages to, you know, basically migrating peoples.

**[01:40:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned Ben, school is Rochester International Academy.

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is a sanctuary city, controversially this year, of course, and the population is very diverse and includes brand new immigrants, some of them from Afghanistan who incidentally Ben helped bring to Rochester.

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[01:52:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Send me an email or click the link.

**[01:52:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let me know if the link works.

**[01:53:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see you again soon.

**[01:53:05] SteveApfelbaum**
> Thank you guys for the wonderful conversation.

**[01:53:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:53:11] Katie Ross**
> Lovely to see everyone.

**[01:53:12] Katie Ross**
> you.

```
**[01:31:10] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'm not jealous.

**[01:31:12] Ben Rubin**
> Looking at, yeah, how to bring some of these, some of the new arrivals to Rochester, go to a special school in the public school system, it's a two-year program where I work.

**[01:31:33] Ben Rubin**
> And it's something where the big focus is on language acquisition.

**[01:31:41] Ben Rubin**
> are largely refugee students coming from conflict areas, but obviously with the political stuff going on, a lot of this is going to change, but it's the program's been around for 13 years.

**[01:31:53] Ben Rubin**
> I've been at the school for three years.

**[01:31:56] Ben Rubin**
> And it's been interesting to try to figure out how to

**[01:32:01] Ben Rubin**
> Have more learning happen outside of the classroom to look at, you know, I teach visual arts.

**[01:32:08] Ben Rubin**
> it's really pretty flexible in terms of.

**[01:32:12] Ben Rubin**
> You know, the curriculum that I bring in, there's a courtyard right next to the classroom.

**[01:32:20] Ben Rubin**
> So I've got a little presentation.

**[01:32:22] Ben Rubin**
> You know, my, my project is literally looking at a very small space in the.

**[01:32:27] Ben Rubin**
> You know, 150 year old school building.

**[01:32:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's pretty small scale, the idea of.

**[01:32:37] Ben Rubin**
> Looking at education and how to transfer some of these larger issues and world challenges into the interest of young students.

**[01:32:52] Ben Rubin**
> I'm seeing if I can share my screen.

**[01:32:57] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see.

**[01:32:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can.

**[01:32:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There you go.

**[01:33:00] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see if this is a hold on a moment.

**[01:33:04] Ben Rubin**
> Okay.

**[01:33:07] Ben Rubin**
> Nope.

**[01:33:09] Ben Rubin**
> Not this one.

**[01:33:10] Ben Rubin**
> Let me see if I can transfer the link over one second.

**[01:33:13] Ben Rubin**
> Apologies.

**[01:33:20] Ben Rubin**
> Do a little bit of digging.

**[01:33:23] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got the Seneca meadows wetland preserve.

**[01:33:26] Ben Rubin**
> That's right.

**[01:33:27] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah.

**[01:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's snowed this morning here in Rochester, but as soon as the weather gets, as it ought to be, I'm eager to go to Seneca meadows.

**[01:33:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It sounds like it'd be a nice, nice trip.

**[01:33:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ben, I do see the, well, I'm just going to bring it over from another window.

**[01:33:51] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's a cool bird, birding hot spot, John.

**[01:33:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's like the only place you can reliably see American bitterns and clapper rails.

**[01:34:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> It's really a pretty damn cool place.

**[01:34:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool.

**[01:34:07] Ben Rubin**
> Sorry.

**[01:34:10] Ben Rubin**
> Let's try this.

**[01:34:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm pasting my achievements form in here again.

**[01:34:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But Russ and Katie and Michael in particular, you will certainly have a number of things for us to put on our roster of look at all the wonderful things.

**[01:34:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Our network has done.

**[01:34:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can also send me an email, but if you do it this way, it'll save me some time, but I'm happy to go through it.

**[01:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:34:41] Ben Rubin**
> We're looking at your screen, Ben.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**
> Great.

**[01:34:43] Ben Rubin**
> I'll just start at the bottom.

**[01:34:45] Ben Rubin**
> These are just some photos of programs last summer.

**[01:34:50] Ben Rubin**
> Getting some of kids out of the courtyard, coming from all over the world, the idea of just getting them interested in the four seasons that

**[01:35:00] Ben Rubin**
> we have here, including winter and April.

**[01:35:04] Ben Rubin**
> Doing different projects.

**[01:35:06] Ben Rubin**
> Let's see, this one is making bird feeders out of the milk cartons in the lunchroom.

**[01:35:13] Ben Rubin**
> We did planters, leaf tracing, different things.

**[01:35:21] Ben Rubin**
> I guess I'd be interested to share this small project.

**[01:35:27] Ben Rubin**
> It's looking at the courtyard space as it's been used and trying to figure out how to find opportunities to bring the students out during all the four seasons.

**[01:35:38] Ben Rubin**
> There is a cherry tree that fruits in the spring, and there's two fig bushes that fruit in the fall.

**[01:35:48] Ben Rubin**
> So it's nice to sort of have those as bookends.

**[01:35:50] Ben Rubin**
> just to give a small window into what's outside my window.

**[01:35:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the cherry tree.

**[01:35:59] Ben Rubin**
> One of the things.

**[01:36:00] Ben Rubin**
> is that is is a big focus for me.

**[01:36:02] Ben Rubin**
> I teach K through 12.

**[01:36:04] Ben Rubin**
> So, you know, my day is kind of this developmental bender of starting out with five year olds and ending with, you know, sometimes 21 year olds.

**[01:36:13] Ben Rubin**
> I've been looking at, let's see, I can share some of this.

**[01:36:17] Ben Rubin**
> I keep the sketchbook.

**[01:36:19] Ben Rubin**
> That's kind of my main artistic practice.

**[01:36:22] Ben Rubin**
> are some sketchbook notes that I've taken doing different educational programs here in upstate New York.

**[01:36:32] Ben Rubin**
> The students also, I think, really benefit from that practice.

**[01:36:38] Ben Rubin**
> So, we bind sketchbooks.

**[01:36:40] Ben Rubin**
> We use tetrapack containers, which are just recycled mill cartons, you know, K through 12.

**[01:36:46] Ben Rubin**
> The students are involved with, you know, binding these books and then learn, you know, practices for journaling.

**[01:36:56] Ben Rubin**
> I think what's really exciting is

**[01:37:00] Ben Rubin**
> look at how to take some of this stuff outside.

**[01:37:02] Ben Rubin**
> we've done a little bit of that.

**[01:37:04] Ben Rubin**
> Again, these are some of my sketchbooks, in terms of the classroom, you know, just sharing some different ideas that I've had using recycled materials and journaling to kids outside.

**[01:37:25] Ben Rubin**
> This is actually the Cornell webcam with birds.

**[01:37:30] Ben Rubin**
> That's something that we use often in the classroom.

**[01:37:36] Ben Rubin**
> You know, sort of rambling, but yeah, that's really it.

**[01:37:40] SteveApfelbaum**
> What Ben, what did the kids gravitate toward when you take them outside?

**[01:37:45] SteveApfelbaum**
> Is there anything that they're really drawn to?

**[01:37:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> it activity like a bird that flies into the view?

**[01:37:55] Ben Rubin**
> What draws them?

**[01:37:57] Ben Rubin**
> You know, being able to take

**[01:38:00] Ben Rubin**
> things or trace things.

**[01:38:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, hands-on stuff, of course.

**[01:38:06] Ben Rubin**
> I feel like just being outside is, they're inside all day.

**[01:38:14] Ben Rubin**
> Public school is really just marching from one room to the other and sometimes just being able to get a sense of where the sun is in the sky and spending a half an hour outside makes a big difference.

**[01:38:29] Ben Rubin**
> It's this little wall up courtyard.

**[01:38:31] Ben Rubin**
> The school was built by Italian immigrants or it was started with an Italian community a long time ago.

**[01:38:40] Ben Rubin**
> So there's some of this stuff.

**[01:38:41] Ben Rubin**
> There's the figs and the cherries that are from previous generations that most of it is just weeds.

**[01:38:55] Natalie Fleming**
> What I find exciting about your work is

**[01:39:00] Natalie Fleming**
> Early childhood development, it's important that they learn that they have power over their environment.

**[01:39:05] Natalie Fleming**
> And when they actually plant a seed and grow it, they're learning that they can shape their environment.

**[01:39:11] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think one of the neatest things is if you can get some of the fast growing trees like willow and poplar, the weed trees, and teach them and all you have to do with the snap-hopper branch and shove it on the ground, it'll grow.

**[01:39:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A lot of kids...

**[01:39:22] Natalie Fleming**
> You know, the idea that when you read Malcolm X's autobiography, he talks about when he was little boy, his grandparents gave him a small piece of soil ground to garden in.

**[01:39:35] Natalie Fleming**
> And I think something inherent in all of us that about growing food, that that basic thing that we have power over gives you a sense of power for the rest of your life.

**[01:39:47] Natalie Fleming**
> You can shape the world around you.

**[01:39:50] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's what you're doing.

**[01:39:51] Natalie Fleming**
> And that's one of the biggest things that these kids can learn is that they have the power to shape the world around them and not just be subject to the world.

**[01:40:00] Ben Rubin**
> So yeah, there's, you know, some things like bird migration has been something that I bring in, you know, there's a really wonderful book called The Arrival by Shontan.

**[01:40:10] Ben Rubin**
> That's a wordless graphic novel that's really worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

**[01:40:16] Ben Rubin**
> But there's also a sort of a project inspired by that book with these postcards of people from around the world writing messages to, you know, basically migrating peoples.

**[01:40:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned Ben, school is Rochester International Academy.

**[01:40:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rochester is a sanctuary city, controversially this year, of course, and the population is very diverse and includes brand new immigrants, some of them from Afghanistan who incidentally Ben helped bring to Rochester.

**[01:40:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's

**[01:41:00] Ben Rubin**
> it is a really interesting environment and you know what you said about tasting out have you done anything with with culinary arts and international cuisines and having the kids basically do go and tell with with the food from home and then talk about where the food came from what kind of plants and animals realistically the people bring in foods for the different holidays it's it's hard just to keep up with the class schedule so you know the a lot of the ambitions that I've had for the courtyard space have been sort of set aside until the spring so but you know there are there are opportunities like the holidays where people bring in food from home at this point you know people are you know they've been in the US for a couple months maybe or at most a year throughout the school so most of them haven't had the opportunity to you know plant some of the stuff that they eat in my neighborhood we do partner with an organization called the Gandhi Institute that was

**[01:42:00] Ben Rubin**
> that has a bunch of plots.

**[01:42:01] Ben Rubin**
> It was started by the Grand Center of Mahatma Gandhi here.

**[01:42:06] Ben Rubin**
> And they do some community gardening programs and they do plant things that are part of the garden or part of the sort of culinary ingredients.

**[01:42:25] Ben Rubin**
> lot of mint, special kinds of leeks that are used in their cuisine.

**[01:42:33] SteveApfelbaum**
> What I was gonna ask Ben is if you could get some containers and figure out what the top herbs that the Tunisians and the Afghanis and literally have each group adopt or each center of origin adopt.

**[01:42:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> You'll wonder, two of the.

**[01:43:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> cullinary herbs that are most pretty reasonably easy to grow and you can probably even buy starts and have them care for them.

**[01:43:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then I don't know how long they're in the class with you, but it's a couple of months, maybe a month into the nurturing, have each group turn the herbs over to one of the other center of origin groups and then share with that other group on a care take.

**[01:43:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> other words, they could pass their culture on through something that might be very symbolic of their food and their origin.

**[01:43:46] Ben Rubin**
> Cool.

**[01:43:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a great idea.

**[01:43:49] SteveApfelbaum**
> I'd love to participate.

**[01:43:52] SteveApfelbaum**
> I love that stuff.

**[01:43:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is there some way you can imagine yourself participating?

**[01:43:59] SteveApfelbaum**
> I can send you

**[01:44:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> some herbs, I can send you some plants.

**[01:44:03] SteveApfelbaum**
> Interesting.

**[01:44:04] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I think the possibility that kids could grow something in their own paper cup in the classroom, sketch its development as it grows, and just do illustration work around that as, and then ultimately related either to cuisine culture is really interesting.

**[01:44:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:44:35] SteveApfelbaum**
> Some of that photosensitive construction paper, I've seen people put that behind the plant material and the flashlight bin and create a caricature and then they'll color it.

**[01:44:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> I mean, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.

**[01:44:57] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah, plant.

**[01:45:00] Ben Rubin**
> uh saps uh you are often different colors if you can pick some you know with a mordant uh acidify them you can dye things i mean there's all sorts of cool things cool and Rochester has a new state park right near the school um by uh the waterfall it's one of the i think it has one of the largest downtown waterfalls in the u.s um you know there's a lot of ecological stuff going on around there so it's interesting just to try to figure out how to connect the dots with um you know the arrivals to the city um it'd be wonderful to try to figure out like you mentioned you know more ways to have them bring some of their knowledge into um you know the art our green spaces but yeah yeah go out and collect some walnuts and some

**[01:46:00] SteveApfelbaum**
> nuts and use those to dye, you know, dye some of the paper or a really cool thing you can do.

**[01:46:08] SteveApfelbaum**
> You've got a lot of introduced invasive white mulberry in your area and get a Chinese paper making book and run that, run the bark, scrape the bark off and run the cambio fiber through a blender and make a paper pulp and you can actually make a pretty cool paper out of that stuff.

**[01:46:32] SteveApfelbaum**
> And then you can use, I can send you pictures of papers that we've made out of invasive plant species and that's a lot of fun.

**[01:46:43] SteveApfelbaum**
> Then you can draw and add cool things into the paper like colored bark of red owes your dog wood and anyways so many cool things.

**[01:46:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you much Steve.

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That'll be your next cover.

**[01:46:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Oh, it's my hobby.

**[01:47:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Listen, folks.

**[01:47:04] Katie Ross**
> Yes, Katie, One other quick idea this may or may not be within the wheelhouse, but you mentioned the waterfall and the state park and just going out there and collecting samples of the water and of the soil and looking at it under the microscope, and seeing these otherworldly sci-fi creatures and creating little zines or those beautiful books that you show and creating stories of these microscopic characters to learn about the role that they play, the unseeable plays that might be fun as well.

**[01:47:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was a great idea.

**[01:47:44] SteveApfelbaum**
> You have a microscope in these little digital, 50 bucks buys you a digital microscope that you can project on the screen.

**[01:47:54] SteveApfelbaum**
> Everybody in the class can look at what you're seeing.

**[01:47:56] SteveApfelbaum**
> Pretty damn cool.

**[01:47:58] Ben Rubin**
> That's worth looking into.

**[01:47:59] Ben Rubin**
> We have these little.

**[01:48:00] Ben Rubin**
> and held, um, magnifying glasses, um, yeah, you know, it's, it is tricky to get the students outside of the school.

**[01:48:07] Ben Rubin**
> mean, that's why that courtyard is sort of, um, warrior.

**[01:48:09] Ben Rubin**
> I'm sort of starting to try to ship things.

**[01:48:12] Ben Rubin**
> Um, but yeah, no, that's, that's a great idea is the, the micro world.

**[01:48:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, I was fascinated by that as a kid and, and still fascinated and I've thought about getting one of those digital devices, which you can assess your phone these days.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:48:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, and they look, they look like they're pretty functional.

**[01:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And of course, there's actually been some huge breakthroughs in soil microscopy.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This guy, Matt Gray, I don't know if you know him, but he's, uh, he's quite a telegenic teacher and developer of these tools for this stuff.

**[01:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's very interesting.

**[01:48:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it ought, I mean, know, the, the disconnect from nature, the difference between the way you describe

**[01:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> of your child that and the norm now is couldn't be larger and it's it's a big part of our problem because if we don't have any sort of intuitions about nature we're not going to do a good job of reconnecting with it.

**[01:49:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> Getting a soil sample from a much landscape and one from or multiple from healthier landscapes and projecting that on the wall it'll blow people away to see all the life and healthy soil and they'll immediately you know see the difference with the deteriorated soil system.

**[01:49:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's actually that sounds like a great little exercise that one yeah that would be useful in lots and lots of circumstances that you may just have given me the justification for spending 50 bucks on the adapter I can use that.

**[01:49:50] Natalie Fleming**
> Hey I would argue that you need an entire tub of each soil sample let people stick their hands in there.

**[01:49:56] Natalie Fleming**
> People love getting their hands dirty.

**[01:49:58] SteveApfelbaum**
> Yeah.

**[01:49:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[01:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> kids in particular, that's fine.

**[01:50:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, yeah, we're all remembering our childhoods now.

**[01:50:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> Ben, one last thing is building mobiles.

**[01:50:11] SteveApfelbaum**
> That, you know, what you find if you go to the park or what kids find in the courtyard, that's a really cool way to create memory and create activity and active mobiles, you know, with bird feathers and sticks and seeds.

**[01:50:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's pretty cool for kids.

**[01:50:33] Natalie Fleming**
> One, Ben, one after-school program when I was doing the after-school gardening program at the district.

**[01:50:39] Natalie Fleming**
> The janitors hated me because for many reasons.

**[01:50:42] Natalie Fleming**
> I went and collected pups of dirt and I made sure that there was lots of insects of various kinds in the soil.

**[01:50:49] Natalie Fleming**
> And then I brought some cookie sheets, large cookie sheets and just dumped out the soil with all the bugs in it and asked the kids to pick out the bugs and talk about which bugs were beneficial and what they do and it was super.

**[01:51:00] Natalie Fleming**
> for fun.

**[01:51:01] Natalie Fleming**
> Dumping bugs in the cafeteria went over really well.

**[01:51:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Ben, from your tone of voice, it sounded like you were you're wondering if this kind of thing is of interest to this group.

**[01:51:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can tell you this.

**[01:51:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's clear.

**[01:51:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We all think what you're what you're trying to do is really important.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'd like to continue to figure out what we can do to gather a You want to show your animation wheels?

**[01:51:33] Ben Rubin**
> Yeah, I'll show a couple of these to it.

**[01:51:35] Ben Rubin**
> But Steve was saying about making the mobiles.

**[01:51:38] Ben Rubin**
> We've done some of that making these little animation wheels.

**[01:51:43] Ben Rubin**
> You you just make a gift where you spin the photo.

**[01:51:47] Ben Rubin**
> But depending on the frame rate, you can sort of have things move in different ways.

**[01:51:51] Ben Rubin**
> So some of this stuff is food, there's some of that that's, you know, from collecting things outside.

**[01:51:56] Ben Rubin**
> So it's this was a fun project to do.

**[01:52:00] Ben Rubin**
> with, you know, not just drawing, you can see there's some of these that are, you know, drawing vegetables and things.

**[01:52:06] SteveApfelbaum**
> that is cool.

**[01:52:09] SteveApfelbaum**
> That's really cool, Ben.

**[01:52:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's even cooler than mobiles, because I've never seen it.

**[01:52:15] SteveApfelbaum**
> That is cool.

**[01:52:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> know, actually, Ben's first year teaching at this school, he did a project along these lines and ended up being featured at the Eastman Museum of Photography.

**[01:52:29] SteveApfelbaum**
> Really?

**[01:52:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And he burned himself out.

**[01:52:34] SteveApfelbaum**
> He's getting a second wind.

**[01:52:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Folks, it is 10 minutes to the end of the hour.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually gone through the agenda.

**[01:52:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have said twice, I'm going to say one more time, I'm really hoping that we can sort of get an inventory of what our members have done that is relevant in the last year.

**[01:52:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
