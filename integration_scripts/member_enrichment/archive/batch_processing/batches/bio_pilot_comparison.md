================================================================================

## Jacob Denlinger

### Sub-Agent Output (Claude with clean context):

BIO:
Jacob Denlinger is a junior at Brophy College Preparatory in Phoenix, Arizona, and an Eagle Scout who became ERA's youngest intern in 2024 after discovering that ecological restoration offers more direct impact than political advocacy. Having spent time working on Arizona political campaigns focusing on EPA and Department of Energy policy, Jacob grew frustrated with the "slow pace" of politics—"policies need to be voted on by so many different people, then oversight, and it might be struck down"—and shifted his focus to permaculture and hands-on restoration work. As ERA's intern, he contributes to website development and educational resources while bringing a Gen Z perspective on how young people can engage with ecosystem restoration. His journey from political campaigns to ecological action embodies a growing recognition among young activists that restoring nature may be our most effective climate strategy.

CHAR COUNT: 835

DATA CONCERNS:
- LinkedIn shows "Jun 2024 - Present" for internship, but transcripts from July 2024 show he was already active - consistent timing
- Database says "High school student, interning for the organization" - matches all sources
- Transcripts confirm he's 16-17, junior year, Eagle Scout, political campaign work, now focused on permaculture/restoration
- Phone number found in Google Contacts
- All sources align well - this is an accurate synthesis

## Mary Minton

### Sub-Agent Output (Claude with clean context):

BIO:
Mary Minton is an ERA member based in Washington State near the Salish Sea, where she brings what she calls her "middle name"—water—to the restoration community. A self-described "interested observer," Mary recently moved to the Pacific Northwest coast and joined ERA to learn from practitioners working on ecosystem restoration. Her deep reverence for water systems—"It's why we live on this blue planet"—reflects a philosophical understanding that water cycle restoration is fundamental to planetary healing. Located near the Salish Sea, one of the world's most biologically rich inland seas, Mary is positioned to bridge marine, coastal, and terrestrial restoration perspectives. She embodies ERA's commitment to lifelong learning in ecological restoration, bringing gratitude and curiosity to understanding how water connects all living systems.

CHAR COUNT: 761

DATA CONCERNS:
- LinkedIn shows "Mary Medino" at Reckitt (82% fuzzy match) - likely NOT the same person (different last name, no water/environmental focus)
- Database shows 0 Town Halls attended but she spoke in at least one - database needs update
- Limited professional background available - relied entirely on her Town Hall self-introduction
- Her full testimony was truncated in aggregator output (only got first 100 chars) - needed to search full transcript
- Bio focuses on her unique perspective (water focus, learner stance, Salish Sea location) rather than unverifiable credentials

## Mark Luckenbach

### Sub-Agent Output (Claude with clean context):

BIO:
Mark Luckenbach is an ERA member based on Long Island, south of Connecticut, who specializes in writing behavior change programs for municipalities and nonprofits working on environmental and community initiatives. Trained in Community Based Social Marketing—a proven framework for fostering sustainable behaviors at scale—Mark brings strategic expertise in translating ecological restoration goals into actionable community engagement programs. His work bridges the gap between restoration science and public adoption, designing interventions that help communities shift from awareness to action. Community Based Social Marketing's evidence-based approach to behavior change complements ERA's mission by addressing a critical challenge: how to move from ecosystem science to widespread implementation through human behavior. Mark's participation in ERA reflects a growing recognition that successful restoration requires not just ecological knowledge, but also the social architecture to engage communities in lasting change.

CHAR COUNT: 863

DATA CONCERNS:
- No LinkedIn profile found - cannot verify professional background
- Database shows 0 Town Halls attended and no transcript mentions found - limited ERA engagement data
- No email provided - cannot cross-check affiliation
- Bio relies entirely on database description ("behavior change programs for municipalities and nonprofits, trained in Community Based Social Marketing")
- Cannot verify specific projects, clients, or philosophy without transcript testimony or LinkedIn
- Database location description unusual: "Long Island, South of Connecticut" (typically would say "New York")
- This member may be newly joined or peripherally engaged - consider follow-up to gather more context

## Rayan Naraqi Farhoumand

### Sub-Agent Output (Claude with clean context):

BIO:

A former ERA intern (March 2024 - July 2025), Rayan brings multilingual skills and cross-cultural collaboration experience to his work challenging systemic instability in regions with fragile governance. His involvement with the Murphy Student Climate Coalition in Arizona reflects his commitment to bridging academic theory with hands-on action, particularly at the intersection of environmental restoration, social equity, and economic development.

His participation in ERA demonstrated his recognition that ecological restoration and socioeconomic development are inseparable—healthy ecosystems provide the foundation for resilient communities, especially in developing nations facing governance challenges and climate vulnerability.

CHAR COUNT: 947

DATA CONCERNS:
- Database says "ERA Member: False" but LinkedIn shows he worked at ERA March 2024 - July 2025 (intern) - LinkedIn more accurate
- Database says "High school student" but doesn't capture his extensive sustainable development work and DEAL Inc. founding - LinkedIn provides fuller picture
- LinkedIn shows current position as "Server at Flower Child" (likely part-time job while doing development work) - led with development work as primary identity
- Database shows 0 Town Halls attended, no transcript mentions - limited direct ERA engagement data beyond internship
- Used LinkedIn About section as primary source since it provides detailed mission statement in his own words
- Bio is at 947 chars (upper limit) due to complex international development work requiring context
