## 1. Alex Carlin

**STATUS:** PENDING

### Bio (678 chars)

Alex Carlin promotes ocean plankton restoration initiatives in West Africa through the Africa Climate Band, a reggae ensemble spreading climate solutions across Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Ivory Coast. His work focuses on plankton ecosystems—where most of Earth's photosynthesis occurs—as a strategy for addressing ocean temperature and acidification. Alex created the anthem "Africa Will Be the Leader" to reframe climate narratives: "Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today." The song positions African nations as climate leaders rather than victims, challenging decades of Western-led climate approaches.  Alex combines music, public engagement (concerts and press conferences), and marine ecosystem restoration.

## 3. Craig McNamara

**STATUS:** SKIP - DATABASE CONFLATION

### Investigation Results

Database entry "Craig McNamara" conflates TWO people:

- **Craig Erickson** (craig.erickson@harvestcraft.org) - Executive Director, HarvestCraft, presented at July 2024 TH
- **Craig McNamara** (SierraOrchards@me.com) - Sierra Orchards walnut farmer, never attended ERA

Database incorrectly assigned HarvestCraft affiliation to McNamara.

**DECISION:** Skip this entry. Consider adding Craig ERICKSON in future batch after verifying he wants bio.

### Comments

Need database cleanup - merge or clarify Craig Erickson vs McNamara records

## 4. Eduardo Marino

**STATUS:** PENDING

### Bio (625 chars)

Eduardo Marino is a Colombian restoration advocate who proposes "Greening the Central American Pacific Coast" to address the mass migration of millions of Central Americans—since 2018—by connecting it to desertification and soil degradation across the Pacific dry corridor from Panama to California. Eduardo proposes large-scale reforestation and water cycle restoration across this 180-million-person region to restore agricultural productivity and address root causes of forced migration. His work demonstrates the inseparable relationship between ecosystem health and human displacement, showing how ecological restoration can address humanitarian crises at their source.
