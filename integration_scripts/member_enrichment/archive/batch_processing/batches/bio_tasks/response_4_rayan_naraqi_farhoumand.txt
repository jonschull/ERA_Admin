DATA CONCERNS:
- Database says "ERA Member: False" but LinkedIn shows he worked at ERA March 2024 - July 2025 (intern) - LinkedIn more accurate
- Database says "High school student" but doesn't capture his extensive sustainable development work and DEAL Inc. founding - LinkedIn provides fuller picture
- LinkedIn shows current position as "Server at Flower Child" (likely part-time job while doing development work) - led with development work as primary identity
- Database shows 0 Town Halls attended, no transcript mentions - limited direct ERA engagement data beyond internship
- Used LinkedIn About section as primary source since it provides detailed mission statement in his own words
- Bio is at 947 chars (upper limit) due to complex international development work requiring context
