BIO:
Jacob Denlinger is a junior at Brophy College Preparatory in Phoenix, Arizona, and an Eagle Scout who became ERA's youngest intern in 2024 after discovering that ecological restoration offers more direct impact than political advocacy. Having spent time working on Arizona political campaigns focusing on EPA and Department of Energy policy, Jacob grew frustrated with the "slow pace" of politics—"policies need to be voted on by so many different people, then oversight, and it might be struck down"—and shifted his focus to permaculture and hands-on restoration work. As ERA's intern, he contributes to website development and educational resources while bringing a Gen Z perspective on how young people can engage with ecosystem restoration. His journey from political campaigns to ecological action embodies a growing recognition among young activists that restoring nature may be our most effective climate strategy.

DATA CONCERNS:
- LinkedIn shows "Jun 2024 - Present" for internship, but transcripts from July 2024 show he was already active - consistent timing
- Database says "High school student, interning for the organization" - matches all sources
- Transcripts confirm he's 16-17, junior year, Eagle Scout, political campaign work, now focused on permaculture/restoration
- Phone number found in Google Contacts
- All sources align well - this is an accurate synthesis
