BIO:
Mary Minton is an ERA member based in Washington State near the Salish Sea, where she brings what she calls her "middle name"—water—to the restoration community. A self-described "interested observer," Mary recently moved to the Pacific Northwest coast and joined ERA to learn from practitioners working on ecosystem restoration. Her deep reverence for water systems—"It's why we live on this blue planet"—reflects a philosophical understanding that water cycle restoration is fundamental to planetary healing. Located near the Salish Sea, one of the world's most biologically rich inland seas, Mary is positioned to bridge marine, coastal, and terrestrial restoration perspectives. She embodies ERA's commitment to lifelong learning in ecological restoration, bringing gratitude and curiosity to understanding how water connects all living systems.

DATA CONCERNS:
- LinkedIn shows "Mary Medino" at Reckitt (82% fuzzy match) - likely NOT the same person (different last name, no water/environmental focus)
- Database shows 0 Town Halls attended but she spoke in at least one - database needs update
- Limited professional background available - relied entirely on her Town Hall self-introduction
- Her full testimony was truncated in aggregator output (only got first 100 chars) - needed to search full transcript
- Bio focuses on her unique perspective (water focus, learner stance, Salish Sea location) rather than unverifiable credentials
