**Self-introduction (lines 161347-161359):**

> "I'm here in Rochester, New York, working in the public school system teaching visual arts the last three years, sort of jumping into the hot seat. There was a big shortage after the pandemic, so it was kind of a career change opportunity. Before that worked with John Scholl with the Enable Project... spent a number of years in Southeast Asia... What I'm going to share is a plan for taking one of the unused outdoor spaces at the school where I teach and turning it into an outdoor classroom, basically a nature peace classroom."
