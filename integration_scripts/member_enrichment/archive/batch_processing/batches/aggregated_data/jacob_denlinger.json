before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

month.\n\n**[00:14:05] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I've been working on primary in the state of Arizona with some super PACs.\n\n**[00:14:14] Jacob Denlinger**\n> We got who we wanted in.\n\n**[00:14:17] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So we're going to have a successful, it's going to be a uphill battle, but it's still going to be a great time.\n\n**[00:14:27] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm not really focused on politics.\n\n**[00:14:30] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I don't really like I think it's it's it's slow.\n\n**[00:14:34] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

working on primary in the state of Arizona with some super PACs.\n\n**[00:14:14] Jacob Denlinger**\n> We got who we wanted in.\n\n**[00:14:17] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So we're going to have a successful, it's going to be a uphill battle, but it's still going to be a great time.\n\n**[00:14:27] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm not really focused on politics.\n\n**[00:14:30] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I don't really like I think it's it's it's slow.\n\n**[00:14:34] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

super PACs.\n\n**[00:14:14] Jacob Denlinger**\n> We got who we wanted in.\n\n**[00:14:17] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So we're going to have a successful, it's going to be a uphill battle, but it's still going to be a great time.\n\n**[00:14:27] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm not really focused on politics.\n\n**[00:14:30] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I don't really like I think it's it's it's slow.\n\n**[00:14:34] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation

So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

in.\n\n**[00:14:17] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So we're going to have a successful, it's going to be a uphill battle, but it's still going to be a great time.\n\n**[00:14:27] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm not really focused on politics.\n\n**[00:14:30] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I don't really like I think it's it's it's slow.\n\n**[00:14:34] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

going to be a great time.\n\n**[00:14:27] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm not really focused on politics.\n\n**[00:14:30] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I don't really like I think it's it's it's slow.\n\n**[00:14:34] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

I'm not really focused on politics.\n\n**[00:14:30] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I don't really like I think it's it's it's slow.\n\n**[00:14:34] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like

yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

Denlinger**\n> That's why it's you need policy and the policies need to be voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

voted on by so many different people and then it has to go through oversight and it might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull**

Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

might be struck down like the Chevron deference.\n\n**[00:14:48] Jacob Denlinger**\n> That's what most of my work was on.\n\n**[00:14:52] Jacob Denlinger**\n> It was on the things with the EPA and the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which

competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

Department of Energy specifically that I could do with that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

that.\n\n**[00:15:00] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, now I can't really, um, and it's a permanent agriculture.\n\n**[00:15:04] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So, um, yeah, so I don't, I don't like politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

politics.\n\n**[00:15:09] Jacob Denlinger**\n> So I'm going to try to get out of that.\n\n**[00:15:10] Jacob Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

Denlinger**\n> But, um, I'm back.\n\n**[00:15:13] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm an interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

interning for this organization.\n\n**[00:15:15] Jacob Denlinger**\n> I'm going to be helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

helping prepare the website, which is something I'm going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

going to spend the rest of week on.\n\n**[00:15:22] Jacob Denlinger**\n> And then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon

Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",

then I'm going to go back to my junior year of high school.\n\n**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, there you go.\n\n**[00:15:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> yeah.\n\n**[00:15:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So Jacob is a highly precocious, hyper competent high school student who has been doing excellent, excellent volunteer work until this is where I brownbeat him.\n\n**[00:15:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He disappeared without of peep for 30 days and just showed back again today saying, I'm back and he promised it would never happen again.\n\n**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And my advice to you is to have that be true because it's actually not really good to do, but I'm really glad you're back.\n\n**[00:15:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Welcome.\n\n**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:16:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now, I recognize your name and I see your face.\n\n**[00:16:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> don't see your face.\n\n**[00:16:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so I don't remember whether you have introduced yourself before.\n\n**[00:16:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you with us?\n\n**[00:16:19] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:20] Edib**\n> Hello.\n\n**[00:16:21] Edib**\n> I did introduce myself once, but then again, I was always either without microphone or without camera, sometimes without both.\n\n**[00:16:34] Edib**\n> So this time I'm without camera, but microphone apparently works.\n\n**[00:16:39] Edib**\n> Definitely.\n\n**[00:16:40] Edib**\n> I am a semi-retired medical doctor.\n\n**[00:16:45] Edib**\n> I got interested in climate change.\n\n**[00:16:49] Edib**\n> My wife says whenever I see a problem, I think I should try to find a solution, which obviously in this case appeared to be true.\n\n**[00:17:00] Edib**\n> in different things that were proposed and quite frankly I don't think I found a solution but I found many people who have found solutions and so I try to basically I guess be a mediator and present what I heard from some to some others and see what will get some traction or not.\n\n**[00:17:27] Edib**\n> The little project that I was involved in that actually were projects involved bamboo in Haiti and that's actually a particular strain that the gentleman from India Dr.\n\n**[00:17:41] Edib**\n> Barati developed that seems to be I guess better than most bamboo in several aspects and so I did that with another gentleman I think he's not here today but he presented I think last time what he did he did many more things actually.\n\n**[00:18:00] Edib**\n> actually he was into planting trees and restoring natural plants ecosystem.\n\n**[00:18:10] Edib**\n> I only wanted to plant this bamboo and actually to see whether this bamboo is as good as Dr.\n\n**[00:18:17] Edib**\n> Barati claimed.\n\n**[00:18:19] Edib**\n> Other than that I did propose a thing or two but again for now I don't think that any of them is reaching this stage where it would be really important.\n\n**[00:18:34] Edib**\n> I'm glad to be here and I want to hear what everybody says and again maybe I'll contribute some.\n\n**[00:18:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much that was perfect but I have to say first of all thank you Philip for bringing it to us I remember that.\n\n**[00:18:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Oh I forgot to thank Philip myself he brought me into this and it is definitely his fault you have to listen there you go and then his and then his colleague that we did hear from was Craig\n\n**[00:19:00] Edib**\n> garrison yes yes okay um but eddard i i probably heard it from craig and i didn't quite hear it from what is it the bamboo is good at that you're looking at well you mean this particular bamboo yes uh well first of all and most importantly it is a very thick walled bamboo so basically most bamboos as you know have a very thin wall and a lot of air inside but this one has quite a thick wall and that's probably and hopefully results in more mass now dr barati claims some really good numbers but that was what we wanted to double check to make sure that his claims are not a little exaggerated because of course he's a developer so he may be prone to a little of a positive view that may not be the real one situation\n\n**[00:20:00] Edib**\n> And then the other thing, the other two things that I'm important with this be my bamboo, it's called be my.\n\n**[00:20:07] Edib**\n> It is sterile.\n\n**[00:20:09] Edib**\n> So it won't flower like most bamboos and then I, it will never flower it will just live forever a sterile.\n\n**[00:20:17] Edib**\n> And it's a camper.\n\n**[00:20:19] Edib**\n> So it doesn't really spread invasively.\n\n**[00:20:22] Edib**\n> You plant it, will spread locally and once it reaches confidence then about, I would say that's it.\n\n**[00:20:31] Edib**\n> And so I think these three things are very positive.\n\n**[00:20:35] Edib**\n> If indeed it can be as good in fixing carbon dioxide as Dr.\n\n**[00:20:42] Edib**\n> Barati claimed, it might be quite a good thing.\n\n**[00:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Interesting.\n\n**[00:20:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I look forward to an update.\n\n**[00:20:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I jokingly referred to this seminar as my continuous, my continuing education program, all of these interesting people come along with interesting.\n\n**[00:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> stories to tell.\n\n**[00:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Given that you just talked about Bamboo and given that we have no particular order, I'm going to introduce briefly Anna Calderon, and I ask her to tell her story.\n\n**[00:21:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The reason she follows is because she's from a university in Panama, which has got a fantastic history of working with that Bamboo, including their headquarters.\n\n**[00:21:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also mention that we've got Jacob, high school student at Abigail, who will introduce herself a little bit later, who is a just graduate from George Mason Smithsonian, the Smithsonian having an important presence in Panama, and Abigail looking for future opportunities.\n\n**[00:21:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna, tell us about you, your history in Panama, and why you're here.\n\n**[00:21:53] Ana Calderon**\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[00:21:56] Ana Calderon**\n> My name is Anna Calderon, and yes, I'm from Geoversia.\n\n**[00:22:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Unfortunately, I'm probably the least qualified person to talk about the bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:05] Ana Calderon**\n> I'm pretty involved in everything but the bamboo, but yes, we have some pretty amazing, I would say, the most amazing bamboo structures in Central America.\n\n**[00:22:18] Ana Calderon**\n> We just finished this gigantic pavilion that is just a stunning building made out of bamboo.\n\n**[00:22:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So yeah, you can check it out on our website, but yes, right on your screen right here, if you like.\n\n**[00:22:33] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, that's actually now finished and it looks really impressive, the finished structure, I put a link to the university website, which also has some aerial shots.\n\n**[00:22:49] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, so everybody that is interested can check out the website.\n\n**[00:22:56] Ana Calderon**\n> But I also made a little presentation.\n\n**[00:23:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes, it was just a week segue, so I get to introduce you after Eddie's dissertation on bamboo.\n\n**[00:23:08] Ana Calderon**\n> Excellent.\n\n**[00:23:11] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, but I made also a small presentation, so I don't know if I should do that now or later.\n\n**[00:23:18] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay, perfect.\n\n**[00:23:20] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm just going to share that, and I don't know what I share.\n\n**[00:23:24] Ana Calderon**\n> If John, you want to talk a bit about my, our projects together or?\n\n**[00:23:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I will know.\n\n**[00:23:33] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Hey John, could I suggest that we finish introductions and get Kwaki and Abigail to say hi and then we can go into presentations.\n\n**[00:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can suggest Kwaki is going to be presenting, sure.\n\n**[00:23:51] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:23:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki, say hello.\n\n**[00:23:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Philip wants you to say hello now.\n\n**[00:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Whatever Philip wants, we do.\n\n**[00:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I continue the education program.\n\n**[00:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's his, your wish is my command meeting.\n\n**[00:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, everybody.\n\n**[00:24:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Hello, old and new friends.\n\n**[00:24:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Uh, yeah, my name's Kwaki William, I'll count from Oklahoma, Seminole Nation in the United States.\n\n**[00:24:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I do all kinds of things.\n\n**[00:24:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't know how much I should say right now.\n\n**[00:24:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of mother tree food and forest and nonprofit that.\n\n**[00:24:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A looks to progress to dance work and research practice and education and agroecology.\n\n**[00:24:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Food forestry and native species reforestation ecological restoration as a whole, but really focusing on native species reforestation because.\n\n**[00:24:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I and the people in that organization are moved by.\n\n**[00:24:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Anastasia Makareva's explanation of how forests drive global climate, which I think it's just an advancement of the Gaia theory in general.\n\n**[00:24:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And, you know, and then the way.\n\n**[00:25:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> People around the world have taken that and run with it.\n\n**[00:25:04] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm really focusing on education right now and that looks like classes in basically soil science, ecology, ecological succession, agroecology, food forestry, ecological respiration, and I look at the climate and ecology crises as a human cultural crisis.\n\n**[00:25:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so decolonization, re-indigenizing to me just mean healing because I think that all of our ancestors were indigenous the entire time and all of these genocides including the genocides of our indigenous European ancestors were all very recent.\n\n**[00:25:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think we're all just sort of reeling, losing all of our ancient relationships and losing a lot of our ancient ancestral wisdom traditions that were maintaining equilibrium for a long time and were sort of disequilibrated.\n\n**[00:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the climate and ecology crises on this planet reflect that disequilibration and.\n\n**[00:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So what we call social permaculture is a lot less visible and clear to a lot of us, but I'm looking at a lot of aspects of that.\n\n**[00:26:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I do natural building.\n\n**[00:26:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The education also looks like workshops.\n\n**[00:26:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> teach centropic agroforestry here in the United States.\n\n**[00:26:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And Miyawaki Reforestation have my education in Miyawaki from a forest group out of India, and have studied with a lot of people in different areas.\n\n**[00:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Elaine Ingham is my soil ecology guru, sort of being there and then look with Bill Zeke, Earthworks for Water Retention, Landscape Water Retention, and just studied all the areas of Western science and all of the ancient indigenous sciences that have something to say about agroecology or ecological restoration that I can get my exposure to.\n\n**[00:26:47] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I marry them all to tell a coherent story of who we are and what's going on here.\n\n**[00:26:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I just, I'm a part of this movement on this planet of all of us trying to figure\n\n**[00:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> out what this new world is that we want to create for ourselves.\n\n**[00:27:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What is this world be that we're trying to move towards?\n\n**[00:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And just a part of these conversations, I'm working with different organizations to begin doing these projects here in the United States, like similar to Oroville and Gaviottas and Tamara and places like that to try to begin doing that here in the United States at scale to where we're doing natural building, know, earth building and geometries which cultivate community for a lot of communal spaces with, you know, my vision is agroecology zone zero like where we live with food forestry, you know, perennial gardens around that and the native species reforestation around that and that's sort of where mother tree food and forest what we're really pushing.\n\n**[00:27:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, this could turn into a presentation right now.\n\n**[00:27:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is not your presentation.\n\n**[00:27:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, great.\n\n**[00:27:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I could yeah, I could\n\n**[00:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I want to do a lot of things in a lot of different realms, working on a lot of different things, and I really love meeting people.\n\n**[00:28:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love the connections.\n\n**[00:28:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> love this organization as a think tank where we can share ideas and strategies, and I love that this is one of the places where this conversation is progressing here in the world, and collectively this conversation, we're getting more details about what this new world is we're trying to create and how we're going to get from world A to world B, so I'm stoked to hear Evan that you're working on this and look forward to having a conversation with you.\n\n**[00:28:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I hope to have a conversation with you about that and everybody else.\n\n**[00:28:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just really, I feel honored, fortunate to be in this community.\n\n**[00:28:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you so much.\n\n**[00:28:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Lovely.\n\n**[00:28:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, following the Bogdanov script, I'm going to invite Abby Gale to introduce herself next, then Indy, then we will circle back to Anna.\n\n**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and others including Kwaki's presentation and Indy's presentation and the Kathleen's presentation.\n\n**[00:29:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abigail, I met you just a couple of days ago in Sotus Point New York where I was giving a talk at a Save Our Bay ecological event and tell us a little bit about yourself and where you're at at this point.\n\n**[00:29:25] Abigail Castle**\n> Hi everyone, my name is Abigail.\n\n**[00:29:28] Abigail Castle**\n> I just recently graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in environmental science.\n\n**[00:29:35] Abigail Castle**\n> So really proud of that.\n\n**[00:29:38] Abigail Castle**\n> And I'm looking to get a job and start a career in this sort of work.\n\n**[00:29:47] Abigail Castle**\n> I have been bouncing around from project to for the past three years.\n\n**[00:29:56] Abigail Castle**\n> I've attended Smithsonian Mason's\n\n**[00:30:00] Abigail Castle**\n> School for Conservation, which is mostly partnered with the National Zoo, but also the National Mystery Museum.\n\n**[00:30:10] Abigail Castle**\n> through that program, I was able to do a project with the National Ecological Observatory Network with Neon that's powered by Battelle, which is an ecological monitoring company that is governmently funded.\n\n**[00:30:37] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to work with the Cincinnati Zoo doing a Black Rhino Behavioral Study.\n\n**[00:30:46] Abigail Castle**\n> So I've done a couple different things and I'm looking to do a couple more and hopefully jump into GIS or more of the microbiome side to conservation.\n\n**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And for the time being, that's great, my first job in college was a summer at the Portland Zoo studying the behavior of Diana monkeys.\n\n**[00:31:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What were you studying behaviorally?\n\n**[00:31:15] Abigail Castle**\n> I was studying black rhinos during, during baby season, which is awesome.\n\n**[00:31:24] Abigail Castle**\n> I got to see some girls with their calves and then some girls that surprised keepers.\n\n**[00:31:33] Abigail Castle**\n> And I also got to see some of the guys that kind of act stalkery, I thought.\n\n**[00:31:43] Abigail Castle**\n> But it was all fun and I'd love to do it again.\n\n**[00:31:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> cool.\n\n**[00:31:49] Abigail Castle**\n> A lot of, a lot of.\n\n**[00:31:53] Abigail Castle**\n> Basically, natural geographic, with the zoos.\n\n**[00:31:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Very cool.\n\n**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Abby's resume because she is actively seeking a job is available on request and I hope you'll be at future meetings as well.\n\n**[00:32:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And we will, of course, be trying to recruit you for anything we can.\n\n**[00:32:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, as we conclude the introduction round, you're going to be presenting later, but because everyone else has, why don't you give us a brief introduction to your person.\n\n**[00:32:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Thanks, John.\n\n**[00:32:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, well, first I just want to honor all of my ancestors and all the sacrifices and courage and resilience that gets me here and allows me to be present.\n\n**[00:32:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then I can't forget all the engineers and all the scientists and all the weirdos that have created the technologies that allow us to connect over thousands of miles and throughout on different time zones.\n\n**[00:32:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And all across the planet.\n\n**[00:32:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's amazing how my silly, we can connect through the innovations of weirdos who.\n\n**[00:33:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Many people didn't believe and thought they were crazy and weird.\n\n**[00:33:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And why are they thinking out of the box?\n\n**[00:33:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And in that spirit, I am one of those myself.\n\n**[00:33:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I am a polymath and I'm owning it these days.\n\n**[00:33:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I, a really smart Indian kid, I always was being put in a box.\n\n**[00:33:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so now I'm just owning.\n\n**[00:33:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Actually, I'm really smart and I like learning a lot of things.\n\n**[00:33:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I like finding people who are really smart at things and learning from them.\n\n**[00:33:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's really fast, how fast you can learn when you're also practicing self-care and self-love and how receptive we become to information and knowledge when we're humble as well.\n\n**[00:33:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I'm really grateful for the path of the warrior saint.\n\n**[00:33:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm a Sikh.\n\n**[00:33:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm Punjabi Sikh from an indigenous community in India.\n\n**[00:33:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm really these days trying to tune and attune myself to the warrior that fights without fighting physically, especially in a time right now where there's so much polarization and division and illusion and delusion, right?\n\n**[00:33:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So many things are there's misinformation, disinformation.\n\n**[00:34:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, in every direction, I'm really owning that we don't need a warrior today that fights physically, but we need a warrior of spirit, a warrior that can build bridges between people and dissolve the separation between the truth and harmony and chaos and entropy.\n\n**[00:34:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's really grateful to show up in this space with that courage and curiosity and celebration.\n\n**[00:34:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:34:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And you'll be presenting about some of the cosmic labyrinths projects a little later tonight.\n\n**[00:34:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I hope you're satisfied, Phillip Bogdanoff.\n\n**[00:34:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Everyone has introduced themselves now.\n\n**[00:34:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna can tell us a little bit more about her background and how she comes to be with us tonight.\n\n**[00:34:52] Ana Calderon**\n> Great.\n\n**[00:34:53] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm going to try to share my presentation now.\n\n**[00:35:01] Ana Calderon**\n> It's not showing up.\n\n**[00:35:06] Ana Calderon**\n> One second.\n\n**[00:35:13] Ana Calderon**\n> Perfect.\n\n**[00:35:14] Ana Calderon**\n> I had too many things open.\n\n**[00:35:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry.\n\n**[00:35:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Everybody can see my.\n\n**[00:35:24] Ana Calderon**\n> Screen now, right?\n\n**[00:35:26] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:27] Ana Calderon**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> Good.\n\n**[00:35:29] Ana Calderon**\n> So it's very, very short, very concise.\n\n**[00:35:34] Ana Calderon**\n> So.\n\n**[00:35:37] Ana Calderon**\n> As John said, I'm Anna from Geover City.\n\n**[00:35:41] Ana Calderon**\n> Currently I am working with Geover City, which is a non-profit foundation based in Panama City, Panama.\n\n**[00:35:51] Ana Calderon**\n> I am Panamanian myself.\n\n**[00:35:54] Ana Calderon**\n> And I would say my areas of expertise are mostly in climate deployment.\n\n**[00:36:00] Ana Calderon**\n> and environmental diplomacy, environmental stewardship, project design and management, climate policy and working with Indigenous peoples and local communities, ocean conservation and working with private philanthropies and multilateral funds and stakeholder engagement.\n\n**[00:36:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So I'm currently working in specific projects that the University is managing which are related to environmental stewardship.\n\n**[00:36:33] Ana Calderon**\n> We have projects related with territorial guardians of specific nature or forest reserves.\n\n**[00:36:43] Ana Calderon**\n> We also have stewardship projects related to protecting the Panama Canal water basin and working with Indigenous communities in that regard.\n\n**[00:36:53] Ana Calderon**\n> well, I think also the purpose of this was announcing that I will be collaborating now with the ERA.\n\n**[00:37:00] Ana Calderon**\n> in a specific project that will be related to protecting the Panama Canal basin and doing important research and restoration work in order to restore these degraded ecosystems and improve the just the hydrology of the area.\n\n**[00:37:23] Ana Calderon**\n> So, we also have project, this project, I believe in the first stage is mostly focused on the education and scientific coordination in order to then define more clearly the restoration goals, but yeah, I thought I had to explain a little bit of my experience, but yeah, I am currently consulting with, with your city on these projects that I explained and, and yeah, and your see also this great bamboo stuff, but that's.\n\n**[00:38:00] Ana Calderon**\n> That's not kind of my side of things, but yeah, I think that was pretty brief.\n\n**[00:38:06] Ana Calderon**\n> I don't know if maybe I should extend more in a specific thing.\n\n**[00:38:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I've been interested in your government.\n\n**[00:38:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You have worked within the Panamanian government in the past, so you're not.\n\n**[00:38:19] Ana Calderon**\n> Tell us a little bit about that.\n\n**[00:38:21] Ana Calderon**\n> Yeah, perfect.\n\n**[00:38:22] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and I also kind of like to take advantage of this nice group of people.\n\n**[00:38:28] Ana Calderon**\n> And I really like to talk about what is climate diplomacy and that is related to what I've done in the government before.\n\n**[00:38:35] Ana Calderon**\n> my previous, my most recent work with the government was specifically related to climate diplomacy and designing the national strategy on climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:38:47] Ana Calderon**\n> So what is this is basically using all the international arena and the international tools and spaces that you have to.\n\n**[00:39:00] Ana Calderon**\n> increase ambition for environmental and climate action goals and in general to do global coordination of efforts for climate action and for climate resilience and adaption.\n\n**[00:39:17] Ana Calderon**\n> So, so basically I work with the Panamanian government by, for example, promoting the specific interest of the of the Central America and the Caribbean region.\n\n**[00:39:29] Ana Calderon**\n> In regards to climate change and also advocating for climate justice in the sense that this country's have not doesn't have the resources to to to do climate action resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\n**[00:39:47] Ana Calderon**\n> And we're going to be really affected.\n\n**[00:39:49] Ana Calderon**\n> So the ones that are the most responsible for the climate change negative effects should also be providing compensation to the ones.\n\n**[00:39:59] Ana Calderon**\n> That did not contract.\n\n**[00:40:00] Ana Calderon**\n> tribute that much to it like Panama, who is mostly a carbon negative country.\n\n**[00:40:06] Ana Calderon**\n> yeah, that is what climate diplomacy is about.\n\n**[00:40:09] Ana Calderon**\n> I've also been the lead negotiator in international treaties, such as the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty or the high seas treaty.\n\n**[00:40:21] Ana Calderon**\n> And things like the, now there's an initiative to make a plastic pollution treaty, like a global treaty to assess the plastic pollution issue.\n\n**[00:40:32] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that's what this is.\n\n**[00:40:35] Ana Calderon**\n> It's just basically using the power that you have in the international community to call for higher ambition and for actions and for climate justice in the sense of providing finance to the countries that are being the most affected.\n\n**[00:40:50] Ana Calderon**\n> by the effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**[00:40:54] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yes, that was a little bit of my work in the government also by doing project.\n\n**[00:41:00] Ana Calderon**\n> design and management and trying to design good projects and seeking for international funding for these projects.\n\n**[00:41:09] Ana Calderon**\n> For example I also did a this was also a nice diplomatic effort between countries to make international reserves like for example marine reserves or forest reserves that involve many many countries and get funding for those initiatives with either private philanthropies or multilateral funds or in a bilateral way as well.\n\n**[00:41:39] Ana Calderon**\n> So yes in the government I was the advisor to the minister for foreign affairs in the previous government period and I was basically dedicated to the cluster of environmental and climate change related projects.\n\n**[00:41:55] Ana Calderon**\n> So I hope that summed it up a bit and then I\n\n**[00:42:00] Ana Calderon**\n> also had previous experience in the Department of International Cooperation by being a project analyst, basically managing all the international cooperation projects that were happening in Panama with international funding.\n\n**[00:42:19] Ana Calderon**\n> So, yeah, that was a little bit of that.\n\n**[00:42:23] Ana Calderon**\n> And then now more in the world of NGOs doing the same project management, fundraising, project design, etc.\n\n**[00:42:33] Ana Calderon**\n> And I've also developed a specialization in working with indigenous peoples and local communities, which is a very, like, how can I say, a very deep topic in itself, because working with indigenous communities, it's totally different than working with other communities, especially in the environmental aspect, because you have to\n\n**[00:43:00] Ana Calderon**\n> understand the the relationship between the culture, the history, the cosmovision that they have, the ancestral knowledge and environmental protection practices.\n\n**[00:43:13] Ana Calderon**\n> So, um, yeah, that's it.\n\n**[00:43:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would say well done, well done for the benefit of the group.\n\n**[00:43:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just want to explain why I'm so excited that we've got Anna on board right now with regard to the Panama project to which she alluded.\n\n**[00:43:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In terms of international relationships, we, the eco restoration alliance, as you know, has got, have got these crazy ideas about how we think we can help straighten out the entire planet before it's too late.\n\n**[00:43:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> By focusing attention on ecosystem restoration, one of the challenges we we recognize in one of our key aspects.\n\n**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> aspects of our mission is to try to refocus attention away from the carbon tunnel vision fixation on atmospheric CO2 and shift attention towards the biologically oriented fixation on living carbon, plants, animals, funguses and ecosystems, which collectively are the climate control system.\n\n**[00:44:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How we get people to shift their attention and to start working on what we think is humanity's last best hope for actually addressing the climate crisis has been a problem we've been struggling with and we have focused on Panama because it's a really interesting place where a lot of these themes converge.\n\n**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> As Anna points out, Panama is carbon negative or carbon neutral and yet it is suffering\n\n**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> from climate change, in part and in particular, suffering because the Panama Canal itself is operating at partial capacity because of the drought.\n\n**[00:45:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Now the drought is typically attributed to climate change and climate change is typically attributed to elevated atmospheric CO2, but where we come from and the Eco Restoration Alliance, we think it is at least as much attributable to degradation of the landscapes that capture the rain, capture the moisture that passes over the Panama watershed, is captured by the vegetation through processes that we hope to study, and also degradation of the landscapes which send moisture into the Panama watershed.\n\n**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we had this still grandiose, but not planetary, planetary plan.\n\n**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> to try to convince the world to focus on the Panama Canal, the slowdown of which is costing the world economy 10 to 50 billion dollars less here alone, and to think about restoring the watershed in order to restore the canal.\n\n**[00:46:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And from our point of view, in order to begin focusing on what really matters.\n\n**[00:46:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> More recently, we've realized that there's a little subsidy in Panama City on the canal called the City of Knowledge where we are hoping to create a restoration lab, which will look at some of the processes and test some of the methodologies that we hope to use in the watershed in general.\n\n**[00:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually a diagram on Indy's screen that just sort of shows on the far left a column of all of the organizations we met during a visit to Panama a few weeks ago.\n\n**[00:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in the middle column you see all of the functions that are that those organizations are working on and we hope to tie them together for in a restoration lab in Panama City where we will study the processes by which ecosystems influence rainfall and we will have students and young people from Panama and internationally Abigail and Jacob we hope running around on campus with drones taking biological measurements and ultimately doing some pilot restoration projects right there.\n\n**[00:47:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anna knows that environment really well and so she's going to be in good position to help us tie together the restoration lab put us in a good position to negotiate with some of the indigenous groups that occupy the entire watershed as well as the\n\n**[00:48:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> government agencies in Panama that have jurisdiction over the watershed and then hopefully help us talk to the international community to raise money for the big watershed project and to get them to start focusing on the right issues in climate diplomacy.\n\n**[00:48:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's the context for Anna and a review of one of our flagship projects that we're working on.\n\n**[00:48:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And thank you very much, Anna, for the role.\n\n**[00:48:31] Ana Calderon**\n> Well, and if I can just react to your great complimentary explanation on the project, yes, I think I gave my background actually on the opposite way because on this project, yes, I will be working mostly in developing the small project and then hopefully in the future and in the later stage becoming a more international advocacy piece.\n\n**[00:48:58] Ana Calderon**\n> for now, yes, I will\n\n**[00:49:00] Ana Calderon**\n> Mainly focus on my project management, strategy, stakeholder engagement, et cetera, and then probably becoming more climate diplomacy oriented in a more global scale.\n\n**[00:49:12] Ana Calderon**\n> But yeah, thank you everybody for inviting me to be part of this group and very happy to meet everybody.\n\n**[00:49:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:49:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, okay.\n\n**[00:49:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, I'm going to dictate that we should hear presentations from Indy.\n\n**[00:49:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the order in which they were invited to present at this meeting.\n\n**[00:49:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Andy, then Kwaki, and then Kathleen.\n\n**[00:49:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If Kathleen, you can stick with us for, let's say, the next hour.\n\n**[00:49:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:49:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[00:49:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Indy, I became aware that you've got all sorts of interesting things, okay.\n\n**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I invited you to give us a sampler of what how Cosmos.\n\n**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Labyrinth is evolving and what it's doing?\n\n**[00:50:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yeah, thank you.\n\n**[00:50:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And thanks, John, for having me on and thanks for that presentation.\n\n**[00:50:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love all this conceptual mapping.\n\n**[00:50:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's so important, I feel, when we can visualize what's happening.\n\n**[00:50:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think that's what we've been doing with Cosmic Labyrinth is reimagining how we get work done.\n\n**[00:50:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, I come from a community where it's really weird.\n\n**[00:50:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I don't know what's happened, but the people who do the farm work are the poor people.\n\n**[00:50:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody looks down on them.\n\n**[00:50:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Even when I tell my cousins who are doctors and lawyers and business people and they're all making money.\n\n**[00:50:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They've got 2.5 children and 2.7 Mercedes and all this stuff and all that.\n\n**[00:50:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And when I say I'm farming, they're like, what?\n\n**[00:50:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Poor people do that.\n\n**[00:50:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What are you doing?\n\n**[00:50:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so with Cosmic Labyrinth, we're reimagining work so that work is something that is\n\n**[00:51:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> actually for our mental well-being.\n\n**[00:51:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our spiritual well-being.\n\n**[00:51:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for our community well-being.\n\n**[00:51:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's for economic well-being.\n\n**[00:51:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But reimagining it also so that it's play.\n\n**[00:51:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the actual labor play?\n\n**[00:51:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make the building play?\n\n**[00:51:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we make, and meanwhile, if you study the science and the neuroscience of play, it's also the best way to solve a problem.\n\n**[00:51:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best way to resolve conflict.\n\n**[00:51:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the best, I mean, literally, like any direction you go, play makes it all better.\n\n**[00:51:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Yet, we make it, we make that the last priority.\n\n**[00:51:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, and meanwhile, we're like, why don't young people want to do stuff?\n\n**[00:51:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Why don't we want to do stuff that we need to do?\n\n**[00:51:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it seems that when we make things more heavier and yuckier and we're angry and we're frustrated by it, like that physiologically is not beneficial, number one.\n\n**[00:51:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And number two, like wow, like what can we do when we play?\n\n**[00:51:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We haven't even done that.\n\n**[00:51:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> think about in our communities, even all of you are doing eco-restoration work, think about like how little we play in all the work we do.\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we do,\n\n**[00:52:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I know all of us are kind of jovial.\n\n**[00:52:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've been seeing people smiling and laughing.\n\n**[00:52:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we are mostly jovial people, like, think about if we turned it up 50% like if our community, the people we work with, if we played 50% more, what would happen?\n\n**[00:52:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like just imagine that for a moment.\n\n**[00:52:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like imagine all the people who are like really mad right now, like people in our community who are really good people, they're really good intention.\n\n**[00:52:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They're really good people, but they're angry.\n\n**[00:52:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Imagine if there were 50% more playful.\n\n**[00:52:29] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder how those angry things that they're frustrated about would not be so frustrating or maybe those stuckness wouldn't be stuckness.\n\n**[00:52:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, so I'm in the science.\n\n**[00:52:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I play a lot in the neuroplasticity space.\n\n**[00:52:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I do a lot of corporate wellness.\n\n**[00:52:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone and done things with Fortune 500 companies, but also done stuff in like, in homeless communities and in substance abuse community.\n\n**[00:52:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I've gone to both extremes and working in prisons, but I've also worked with the police and I've like tried to go between like working with wealthy children versus working with children who don't have access to a lot of resources.\n\n**[00:53:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I had to understand like what's going on at the core like what is what is a shared difficulty in all these different spaces and once again I always goes down to laughter laughter literally I'm like oh my gosh like if I could see the size of one thing is laughter like if we all just laugh more and so that's kind of the precipice of why I show up with cosmic labyrinth that's my duty with cosmic labyrinth is to make make it fun and make it laugh a lot and encourage us to even laugh about the things that frustrate us and laugh at the shadows because it's hard to see the shadows and in order to face them unless we're laughing and using humor and maybe he's not even humor sometimes by the way you guys know that only 10 to 15% of our laughter is based on humor so most of our laughter is not from humor right so that's just to think about that one right that interesting scientific fact but so one of the things we've done this year is we've started pivoting this year in going to conferences and festivals and starting to challenge those spaces to\n\n**[00:54:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> post their food waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There's a lot of waste that happens and we call it waste, but that's all carbon, right?\n\n**[00:54:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You guys know what we're talking about, waste.\n\n**[00:54:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like there's no waste, right?\n\n**[00:54:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is actually like juicy, yummy goodness for the soil.\n\n**[00:54:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we're like people, we're throwing it away or we're throwing in a dump, we're throwing it in the ocean or the bays, right?\n\n**[00:54:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So what we're doing is reimagining what we, how we, how we even talk about waste.\n\n**[00:54:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that has pivoted us.\n\n**[00:54:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we've done a few festivals, we did a few conferences and we're getting invited to some other, I hope you guys can join us.\n\n**[00:54:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'll share some links in the chat too.\n\n**[00:54:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if you can join us at a festival and actually experience how we do it, how we make the whole process and how we do it inclusively, how we include our indigenous brothers and sisters and how we include our cultural intelligence and our spiritual intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we integrate that into our ecological intelligence.\n\n**[00:54:48] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also bring the scientists too, right?\n\n**[00:54:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't want to ignore the scientists, but we want to make it fun.\n\n**[00:54:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So the engineers and the scientists can also play and have a space to breathe and open up and not be so restricted, you know, and that's maybe, maybe there's a little bit more\n\n**[00:55:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play also in that space we need.\n\n**[00:55:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> what's pivoted in the past few months for us is we got reached out by somebody who is also a part of Eco-Restoration Alliance, Billy Marie, who has a 10 acre reforestation project in LA County.\n\n**[00:55:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's actually Mojave Desert.\n\n**[00:55:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's the bio region of the Mojave.\n\n**[00:55:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's, you know, it's food desert.\n\n**[00:55:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's reforesting those 10 acres, right?\n\n**[00:55:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she reached out to us and we kind of had a little talk with her.\n\n**[00:55:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she kind of pitched to us.\n\n**[00:55:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> She's like, hey, can you help me with something with the land that'll really help the land?\n\n**[00:55:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we're like, okay, well, it depends.\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What do you need?\n\n**[00:55:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And she's like, well, people come and stay and like, they poop and I have to clean the poop and like, I have to dump and do all this stuff.\n\n**[00:55:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And I'm like, what?\n\n**[00:55:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like, what if we build a sacred eco toilet?\n\n**[00:55:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, a sacred one in the sense of making an eco toilet so that when people come in, say it or Airbnb, or they come and work on the land, they actually learn that human newer is a resource.\n\n**[00:55:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a resource to regenerate our lands and to\n\n**[00:56:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> it with with with awareness also that our poop if we eat healthy the land is going to be healthy too right so turning that that circular loop and the education around it so we created this event i'm going to share this in the chat with you guys um the intention also with all of you that are around the world is for us to be imagining how we can do different kind of um eco hackathons right or like uh we remember those home home improvement shows that were so popular they're still so popular right how can we do like that kind of show how can we make it fun and engaging to actually go and support a farm or go and support an eco restoration project and we could come as a group and make it fun and produce it and have it really engaging but also we can make it so we can keep coming back maybe like if it's a farm we can come back when there's a harvest or when there's a planting season or if there's an eco restoration project we come back when it's the right time and we could bring the people energy and bring the scientists and the engineers but also the artists and the spiritual folks and the musicians and the indigenous folks and the\n\n**[00:57:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> modern people, but we can bring, kind of create a confluence of convergence, of action, of embodied action.\n\n**[00:57:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also, I think self-care, and self-awareness.\n\n**[00:57:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so in that sharing, I'm also going to share this link.\n\n**[00:57:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is our GoFundMe.\n\n**[00:57:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Not that you guys can donate, but donate, donate.\n\n**[00:57:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You can donate also.\n\n**[00:57:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we just created an arbitrary $7,000 Go.\n\n**[00:57:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We raised some money, but I think it's really interesting to think that we didn't really market really hard or anything, but we could cover our costs.\n\n**[00:57:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> In fact, not only did we cover our costs, but one of the organizations gave us $5,000 worth of equipment to build the sacred door.\n\n**[00:57:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And it's called EcoSet.\n\n**[00:57:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So it's a company out of a nonprofit out of LA that takes Hollywood sets.\n\n**[00:57:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> They take film and music and TV show sets, and they recycle them, or they auction them.\n\n**[00:57:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And they just gave us $5,000 worth of stuff.\n\n**[00:57:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we didn't have to even buy that because they saw the project we're doing.\n\n**[00:57:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> just for all of us to reimagine how\n\n**[00:58:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> there's a lot of abundance.\n\n**[00:58:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How do we tune into that abundance when we come together and we resource each other, right?\n\n**[00:58:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Another thing I'm gonna share with you guys, and I hope this is something you all can also take from, is we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't have the technology yet.\n\n**[00:58:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to have a technology we can use that whenever we do an event, whenever we do a festival, kind of, you know, we would love to have a technology that we can onboard people so they can get an idea of the story.\n\n**[00:58:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we've been using Canva.\n\n**[00:58:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm gonna share this link with you guys.\n\n**[00:58:26] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You're welcome to scroll through it and see kind of how we operate.\n\n**[00:58:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> we generate basically an interactive playbook whenever we do an event.\n\n**[00:58:35] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that allows people to kind of get a breakdown of like, what's it about?\n\n**[00:58:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the story?\n\n**[00:58:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the point?\n\n**[00:58:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the agenda?\n\n**[00:58:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> All right, we like to say azenda.\n\n**[00:58:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's the azenda?\n\n**[00:58:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> You know, what is the epistemology?\n\n**[00:58:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What's our, like this right here, you got our design is actually in here too, like our design actually aspect of what we're thinking about designing.\n\n**[00:58:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we also put in opportunities for people to share what kind of playbook\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> play shops.\n\n**[00:59:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We call them play shops, by the way.\n\n**[00:59:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We don't call them workshops.\n\n**[00:59:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why.\n\n**[00:59:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I wonder why we call it workshops.\n\n**[00:59:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Don't call it workshops, but we have play shops.\n\n**[00:59:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so people can submit to do a play shop.\n\n**[00:59:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we, and by the way, speaking of Jacob and anyone who's a younger Abigail, we love to have the youth come and teach as well.\n\n**[00:59:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because we think we believe in intergenerational wisdom.\n\n**[00:59:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we've had 10 year olds teach classes or in play shops during our eco restoration activities, right?\n\n**[00:59:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So we want actually everybody to teach, right?\n\n**[00:59:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And share their knowledge and wisdom or their magic.\n\n**[00:59:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But as you can see, you look in here, we're kind of, we're all over the place.\n\n**[00:59:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But you can see there's clearly a theme, right?\n\n**[00:59:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> A theme of embodied diversity, right?\n\n**[00:59:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like not like performative diversity, embodied diversity.\n\n**[00:59:46] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because I think there's a little bit of perform, there's a little bit extra performance these days.\n\n**[00:59:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want to actually bring in the embodied aspect of it, where it's celebratory, where we're driving curiosity, and we're also driving courage.\n\n**[00:59:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we want folks to be antifragile.\n\n**[00:59:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We want you to get your hands dirty.\n\n**[01:00:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> When we invite people from the county or the city council, we make them get in the dirt.\n\n**[01:00:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like we don't, they're not, we're not just sitting there to sit there and let them talk at us.\n\n**[01:00:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're like, no, first you get in the dirt and then we'll talk to you, right?\n\n**[01:00:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So I think that's also important is creating the culture where everybody's getting dirty, everybody's getting on their hands and knees, right?\n\n**[01:00:18] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we communicate from that place of service, from that place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:21] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's something that I feel is what we can learn from the saints, from every walk of life from every culture is actually let's get people first to the place of humility.\n\n**[01:00:30] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then we solve problems.\n\n**[01:00:31] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think you said climate diplomacy.\n\n**[01:00:34] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> How can we do climate diplomacy from a place of play and humility, right?\n\n**[01:00:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And service.\n\n**[01:00:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And that's kind of what we've been cultivating.\n\n**[01:00:41] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And then last but not least, I'll leave you guys with this form that we've been using to, we've gotten a bunch of sign ups and I just want to share this with you guys because I'm proud of what we co-create.\n\n**[01:00:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> This is not just me.\n\n**[01:00:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's a very co-creative process.\n\n**[01:00:55] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm just one mycelial node of this matrix.\n\n**[01:00:59] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm the chief policy.\n\n**[01:01:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pollinator, right?\n\n**[01:01:01] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's why I'm here talking to you guys.\n\n**[01:01:02] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Everybody else has different roles and responsibilities.\n\n**[01:01:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got earthworms.\n\n**[01:01:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything.\n\n**[01:01:06] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun guys.\n\n**[01:01:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got fun girls.\n\n**[01:01:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We've got everything on our team.\n\n**[01:01:09] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we keep growing.\n\n**[01:01:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And we want to invite all of you.\n\n**[01:01:12] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> If you guys have an eco restoration project, a farm, a project anywhere around the world, how can we collaborate together to reimagine festivals that give back to the land and remind us of how amazing and amazing we all are, how resilient we are, how our mythology actually informs how we show up, right?\n\n**[01:01:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And also we respect also that this is called crow operation.\n\n**[01:01:37] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> The crow is also really important mythology, right?\n\n**[01:01:39] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like if you think about permaculture and indigenous, literally ecological practices, the crow is important for shifting the energy of a place that has been destroyed and has been, know, just any place that's been completely messed up.\n\n**[01:01:54] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> crow is the transition, it's transitionary, you know, energy, but I'm curious what your guys' thoughts are dropping in the chat of what the\n\n**[01:02:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> pro means to you, but or the raven or the court, the corvid COVID COVID.\n\n**[01:02:04] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Anyways, well, it's too close, too close for comfort there.\n\n**[01:02:08] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But yeah, I think it's also important for us to cultivate this relationship with nature and natural, animistic kind of vibrations, right?\n\n**[01:02:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We can still appreciate the unifying God or interconnectedness or whatever that you want to call that energy.\n\n**[01:02:23] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we also have to honor the animals.\n\n**[01:02:25] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if the animals inform us how we can show up?\n\n**[01:02:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I think Kathleen, you had a great picture I saw with the beaver, right?\n\n**[01:02:33] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And like, how do we do a festival around the beaver, where the beaver needs to be honored and respected in a place that needs we need to rebuild the delta, right?\n\n**[01:02:40] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so the beavers can come back like what if we have to honor the animals and the plants in that way for them to also regenerate?\n\n**[01:02:47] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> mean, that's I'm getting into kind of the mystical aspects.\n\n**[01:02:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But like, what if that's a part of it?\n\n**[01:02:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like what if we instead of just doing the scientific dot dot dot thing, which I'm all about at, right?\n\n**[01:02:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> was a biological sciences major at UC Davis.\n\n**[01:02:58] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I can get into the science with you guys.\n\n**[01:03:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But what if we need to get a little bit mystical and magical?\n\n**[01:03:03] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> What if we need to do that first or alongside parallel?\n\n**[01:03:07] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So that's what we're doing with Cosmic Labyrinth.\n\n**[01:03:10] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> There'll be more stuff happening if you guys want to play with us.\n\n**[01:03:14] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> By the way, we did San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:16] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We did three events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:19] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Two of our events were outside.\n\n**[01:03:20] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We were the only ones who did outside events at San Francisco Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:24] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Just to let you guys know, else did anything outside.\n\n**[01:03:28] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So, Climate Week.\n\n**[01:03:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, you don't do this.\n\n**[01:03:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You're based in LA, but you're doing this in various locations.\n\n**[01:03:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's your range these days?\n\n**[01:03:42] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I love it.\n\n**[01:03:44] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I mean, Evan, I met Evan in Hawaii, and we were doing projects in Hawaii that were actually around citizen assemblies.\n\n**[01:03:50] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> were doing regenerative civic assemblies, where we're going to farmers markets and doing citizen assemblies while helping out the farmers market.\n\n**[01:03:57] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We went to a community farm in Orchidland and helped out a\n\n**[01:04:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> local farmer who feeds the people in the Kupuna's and we did a citizen assembly there on that land.\n\n**[01:04:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> so we've done Hawaii, we've done Texas, we're between all over California.\n\n**[01:04:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We would love to do stuff in New York and East Coast.\n\n**[01:04:13] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> We're in talks with a couple of things in the East Coast as well.\n\n**[01:04:17] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> really the dream is kind of we I think what we do really well is we're the activation energy.\n\n**[01:04:22] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's ideally we would love to just hand it off to the people who live in bioregional spaces, right?\n\n**[01:04:27] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But there it does need to be an activation energy, facilitation of that activation.\n\n**[01:04:32] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Because, you know, sometimes it's people we're stuck, like we get stuck and that's OK.\n\n**[01:04:36] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And as a community, we get stuck, right?\n\n**[01:04:38] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> And so how do we unstuck that energy and then folks have autonomy with their space?\n\n**[01:04:43] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Like that's I think ideal, right?\n\n**[01:04:45] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> John is like, we don't want to impose what people do in their in their home.\n\n**[01:04:49] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> But we want people to love their home and honor their home.\n\n**[01:04:53] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, by the way, by the way, to add that add to that, John, I'm now in the Bay Area and I'm actually planning a eco restoration.\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> I'm in the Bay\n\n**[01:05:00] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Delta and I'm on the water on the bay and there's this there's a huge potential here.\n\n**[01:05:05] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> It's where I live now in the bay area right next to the C and H factory, which is defunct.\n\n**[01:05:11] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So there's a huge opportunity to do something huge on the bay here.\n\n**[01:05:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> So if anybody's in the bay area and wants to collaborate at some point.\n\n**[01:05:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:05:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:05:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You know, when I was when I was a psychologist, a classmate of mine was doing.\n\n**[01:05:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Piaget studies with the little children saying, you know, pouring liquid from one glass to another and saying, which has more and so on.\n\n**[01:05:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And a four year old looked up at her and said, lady, you do this for a living.\n\n**[01:05:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So apparently you figured out how to do this for a living, right?\n\n**[01:05:51] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:05:52] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> right now we're kind of in this phase where we're transitioning to getting funding so that we could build a digital directory that has equal restoration.\n\n**[01:06:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> project all over the world that has connections to farmers and guard community gardens and ways for people to earn currency and currency around the elements fire earth wind and water for serving those different elements in different ways so we're we're looking to build a directory so think of imagine us being the eco disney we're building an eco disney i mean literally we're a bunch of teachers and educators and entertainers that are both entertainers entertainers and we're we're re recreating a disney that is based in real mythology not captured mythology not manipulated mythology but actual our all of our cultural mythology that honors how we show up ecologically as well so that's i i don't remember whether i've alerted you to my pet project currently waiting for someone to take it on the big map to save the future dot org um and i want you to know that if you want to put your directory on the map it's\n\n**[01:07:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's waiting for your input.\n\n**[01:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So we should talk about that in the future Tempus Fugit and John it's actually net.\n\n**[01:07:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I was not net of my own website and Okay, I first I mentioned I'm gonna get in trouble one of our one of our members causing lab with members wrote an article About human your and human waste that kind of goes along with our project So we whenever we do projects we create content around it that promotes it So please share that and or read it and yeah I mean we need to create a movement around poop because what we're doing with our food It's no bueno, you know by the way the next event that I think many of us are gonna be at is New York in September at New York City Climate Week It's not completely clear what our engagements are gonna be but there\n\n**[01:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will be some, to my knowledge, no one event at New York Climate Week happened outdoors.\n\n**[01:08:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> see, I've scared them off.\n\n**[01:08:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I, perfect.\n\n**[01:08:15] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> Okay, are you calling a crow to come to New York Climate Week?\n\n**[01:08:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I am suggesting you look into it, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\n**[01:08:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And now, without further ado, I want to transition to our next presenter, which would be Quaqui.\n\n**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Wendy.\n\n**[01:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry, any, any questions, tips or comments for Indy before he passes the torch?\n\n**[01:08:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My advice, Indy, is to cheer up.\n\n**[01:08:56] Cosmic Labyrinth**\n> That's all I got to say.\n\n**[01:09:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, first of all, thank you, India.\n\n**[01:09:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a real joy to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you for the presentation, all the good work you're doing, the wonderful comprehensions you're bringing, bridging different worlds together and opening up channels for all kinds of ancient, deeply rooted wisdom traditions to inform our healing process here in the techno industrial world.\n\n**[01:09:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I recognize the significance of that, and that strategy is just powerful and beautiful in my comprehension.\n\n**[01:09:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I'm just overjoyed to get to know you.\n\n**[01:09:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to have a conversation with you sometimes Satnam, brother.\n\n**[01:09:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:09:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Oh, so first of all, John, I would way prefer to give this presentation next week to a group of 53.\n\n**[01:09:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I could give a I could slide through and do a quick one here if that's quite all right.\n\n**[01:09:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's actually.\n\n**[01:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> zero probability that we'll get all 50.\n\n**[01:10:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't know how it happened.\n\n**[01:10:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So it might be a smaller crowd, but if you want another week, it so happens you have that opportunity if this time slot is good for you.\n\n**[01:10:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think I'll take one.\n\n**[01:10:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:10:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I will give the presentation right now and just trust magic and spirit and the way things flow.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a joy.\n\n**[01:10:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> feel honored to be in this to me.\n\n**[01:10:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just a beautiful juxtaposition between Anna Calderon's lived experience and strategies and in these is just is representative to me of the power of this type of think tank that we have such diverse skill sets and backgrounds and competencies that you know to have a group of people like this organization come together to share our\n\n**[01:11:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> drinks with these common goals and ethics is just unbelievably exciting for me and I try not to waste to use adverbs that much but man this is really a joy and I'm gonna privilege very exciting for me um and yeah really so I hope to get to know the people here who I don't know yet um feel free to reach out to me I should do sorry I should do some of that sharing I've got a little bit of um I have some links and some things I'll share my email address and stuff like that as well I'd like to start by introducing myself properly um my name is Koaki William Wildcat I'm from the Oklahoma Seminole Nation I'm Cougar clan Thomas Palmer band um my purpose with everything I'm doing spiritual path basically is to\n\n**[01:12:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Stabilize global climate, mitigate the extinction event, and help humans heal and restore relationships.\n\n**[01:12:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And find equilibrium, find health and happiness.\n\n**[01:12:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And my, you know, my, the vision I'm sort of pushing to the work that I do is this agroecology in zone zero food forestry around that native species reforestation around that.\n\n**[01:12:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The agroecology, because we can improve, we can, we can heal and improve the health and resilience and productivity of the ecosystem that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:38] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we are intelligent about our methodologies for how we get our food, we can benefit the ecosystem around the area that we're getting our food from.\n\n**[01:12:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we do intelligent forms of agroecology, such as job agroforestry, the ancient form of meal, all of these indigenous agroforestry systems from around the world that are still.\n\n**[01:12:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> existent and are very, very advanced and which understand and work.\n\n**[01:13:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> work with ecological succession and really understand ecological succession, how ecosystems function.\n\n**[01:13:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there is none of that in Western academia here in the United States.\n\n**[01:13:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I've met nobody with an ecology education from any university in the States who understands ecological succession or how to work with ecosystems in order to event to accelerate the rate of ecological succession as measured by biomass, biodiversity, organic matter, small water cycle function, etc.\n\n**[01:13:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> These concepts don't even come up in academic background worlds because our infant science in the techno industrial world is a reductionist compartmentalizing science that's only a couple hundred years old.\n\n**[01:13:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And there are some thousands of years old, maybe 10,000 tens of thousands of years old sciences around the world which have never lost their ecology knowledge.\n\n**[01:13:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I view\n\n**[01:14:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of our main priorities in for it for us in the climate ecology action space, I think it is priority one for us to find ways to open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions, which are ancient integrated applied sciences.\n\n**[01:14:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So integrated as opposed to compartmentalizing and reductionist quite, you know, more powerful in that way by far than our Western science.\n\n**[01:14:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then when we say ancient applied science, if it's a thousands of years old applied science, we mean that it has had all the time in the world to work out the kinks.\n\n**[01:14:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we know what works now for sure.\n\n**[01:14:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so these very powerful sciences that really eclipse everything we're doing in the Western world, of what everything we're calling regenerative agriculture and all of our forms of ecological restoration, which combined have not been very powerful so far.\n\n**[01:14:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, I think we have an obligate.\n\n**[01:14:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think it's our duty to find every way we can to.\n\n**[01:15:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> open up channels for these ancient deeply rooted wisdom traditions who are mostly all offering the solutions, everything we need on this planet existed 100,000 years ago and we can be certain about that because we are here right now.\n\n**[01:15:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so indigenous peoples around the world are terrified of this confused, tormented state that the techno-industrial world is in right now and of the damage that we're doing and they're offering us the answers that we need, the solutions that we need are all around us omnipresent, all around us and are being offered to us.\n\n**[01:15:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I think it's our job to open up as many channels as we can to allow these ancient wisdom traditions to ring to just allow that wisdom into the techno-industrial culture to heal us.\n\n**[01:15:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> like I said in my introduction, I believe the climate ecology crisis is a symptom of this human cultural crisis, which is the reverberations of the genocides of all of our indigenous ancestors, colonization that we've all been through.\n\n**[01:16:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm just looking at all of that as a healing process.\n\n**[01:16:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are social workers in cities around this country who have let go of all of their training and are focusing only on decolonization work because they're seeing bigger quicker healing of individuals, of families, and of communities when they only focus on decolonization and re-indigenizing and let go of everything they learned in universities and psychology classes and counseling and all of that because these, again, there are ancient psychology traditions from around the world that include powerful, more developed forms of somatics and all of these areas of Western psychology is just beginning to, under, to just look at, touch the surface of, there are extremely developed traditions around the world that are more powerful with all of that.\n\n**[01:16:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I look at decolonization and re-indigenizing as as just meaning healing and that healing is what we need because\n\n**[01:17:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In my comprehension, because I believe that the injury that we're suffering from is what's causing the broken relationships, the broken relationships are what's causing this breakdown and one of the real specific things there is just this loss of comprehension that we are a part of this larger organism and that's a translation from Portuguese, which is translated from an indigenous language in Brazil, which describes the whole forest as one organism, and every plant and every fungi organism in that forest as being a cell in the body of every animal being like a biota in the body of the metal organism.\n\n**[01:17:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so this is a metaphor, which is not a metaphor.\n\n**[01:17:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is actually true.\n\n**[01:17:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Indigenous cultures around the world have never forgotten this.\n\n**[01:17:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are some some branches of Western science that are already remembering this.\n\n**[01:18:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You know, the Suzanne Simmered stuff, and of course, she was just expanding on other mycologists' work, showing how migrazyl networks communicate information and resources between plants.\n\n**[01:18:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we were talking about like vascular systems and neurological systems within the forest.\n\n**[01:18:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But there's all this other form of information transfer, other forms of nutrient cycling and everything like that.\n\n**[01:18:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So in centropic agroforestry, we understand and work with this reality in very powerful ways.\n\n**[01:18:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> we, centropic agroforestry is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:18:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's a very advanced form of agroecology, which is simple enough still to explain in the techno-industrial cosmology, to where somebody from our culture could understand it and learn it in one lifetime, where some of these ancient indigenous agroforestry systems are so complex that, you know, being intergenerational.\n\n**[01:19:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> that, I mean, inter-millennial and intergenerational traditions that it would be tough for somebody my age to just begin learning it and even become halfway proficient and like them.\n\n**[01:19:15] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just say what I do here.\n\n**[01:19:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm a board member of this organization, founder and executive director of an organization I started called Another Tree, Food and Forest, which as I said looks to advance research, practice and education in agroecology, food forestry and ecological restoration really specifically focusing on the form of agroecology, which we call a successional agroforestry, meaning really working with ancient deeply rooted ecology, wisdom traditions to do agriculture in ways that are very, very powerful at restoring the ecosystem, the larger ecosystem that we're working in.\n\n**[01:20:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> can you give us an example of how you accelerate succession using ancient indigenous traditions?\n\n**[01:20:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah, yes.\n\n**[01:20:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In synchropic agroforestry, one of the most powerful, again, we say this is a process-driven system, not an input-driven system.\n\n**[01:20:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So working with ecological succession to accelerate it.\n\n**[01:20:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One of the powerful tools they use is the similar tool that we use in regenerative raising, although I don't think we're very, very clear about in the United States, you know, I've studied with Holistic Management International.\n\n**[01:20:39] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I don't think they understand fully what they're doing and talking about because they don't really honor Elaine Ingham and all of her education.\n\n**[01:20:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If they were to just really honor the guru that she is, then they would understand better what they're doing.\n\n**[01:20:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Same with synchropic agroforestry, same with, you know, a forest with meal pod and they have taken Elaine Ingham as a guru.\n\n**[01:20:59] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they're really\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> growing quickly now.\n\n**[01:21:02] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's this thing called synchropic pruning where if, you know, any plant has a store of sugar, lipids, proteins, and those are still just sugar, know, proteins of sugar with some nitrogen atoms in it, lipid is sugar with the OH or something like that.\n\n**[01:21:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that's all, some photosynthesis is all sun energy in the form of chemical energy.\n\n**[01:21:23] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And this is all sugar for chitin, lignin, cellulose, proteins, lipids, it's all sugar from photosynthesis, sun energy.\n\n**[01:21:32] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So plants keep a store of foods and medicines in the middle third of the plant.\n\n**[01:21:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So the first third of the ground, the first third below the ground, the middle third, and this is an approximation.\n\n**[01:21:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So because every plant evolved to be eaten by animals.\n\n**[01:21:44] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so, and most of them, in most cases, whatever that happens, evolutionarily, it usually doesn't kill the plant, it's like a fraction of the plant is taken.\n\n**[01:21:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> In natural situations, you know, we know from regenerative grazing, the regenerative grazing example, when we kill all the predators and\n\n**[01:22:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> and lock grazers into a finite area, they have the option now and no choice even sometimes, but to eat the plant all the way to the ground and they're eaten through that store of sugar, they can destroy the photosynthetic capacity, they can even kill the plant.\n\n**[01:22:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And in regenerative grazing, we have them eat a bit of it and move on.\n\n**[01:22:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And what that does, when you take a fraction of a plant, you stimulate it to release that store of foods and medicines into the soil food web, creates a, which stimulates like a flush of biological activity, which creates a flush of metal atoms being freed nitrogen, atoms being free being put into organic molecule being, you know, how Mike Reisel Fungi will strip atoms off of rocks and put metal atoms, the plant nutrients into organic molecules that plants and animals can use because we cannot use them in mineral form.\n\n**[01:22:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And they'll exchange them for sugar with the plant.\n\n**[01:22:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Consensual relationship might go Reisel Fungi plant, Reisel and plant root relationship.\n\n**[01:22:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When plants, when you take a piece of a plant\n\n**[01:23:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You stimulate it to release food medicine to create a biological flesh which creates a flesh of incoming metal atoms because the plant can photosynthesize.\n\n**[01:23:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It can take the sky elements, Sean, the organic elements, make sugars, lipids, proteins all day, but they can't get metals.\n\n**[01:23:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They're reliant on the soil microbiology to do that.\n\n**[01:23:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So when you take a big piece of them, a significant piece, say 30%, for instance, not too much.\n\n**[01:23:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> don't kill the plant.\n\n**[01:23:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You don't destroy its photosynthetic capacity, releases a flesh of food medicine and soil food web, results in flesh of biological activity, resulted in increase in the rate at which they are receiving metals.\n\n**[01:23:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is the western science explanation for this ancient indigenous practice.\n\n**[01:23:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm explaining it.\n\n**[01:23:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> the practice in this case is sort of ensuring moderate grazing, not leaving it undisturbed, not nibbling it down to the ground, but sort of taking a tax off of the plant.\n\n**[01:23:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> that what, is that the\n\n**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the practice you were talking about.\n\n**[01:24:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm going to get to that in less than 20 seconds, I believe.\n\n**[01:24:05] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:24:07] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That resulted in increase in the rate at which metal atoms are coming up in the form of organic molecules.\n\n**[01:24:12] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant allows that plant to quickly build back to a state of optimal, it's optimal physiologic state for reproduction.\n\n**[01:24:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What ends up happening is that plant left more organic matter in the soil that year than it would have otherwise.\n\n**[01:24:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It ended up making more biomass that year than it would have otherwise, and all that turns into organic matter, dead biomass.\n\n**[01:24:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> More top soil is created, more soil, more organic matter is put into the A horizon, the mineral horizon to create, to turn dirt into soil.\n\n**[01:24:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> The plant creates more, and that benefits everybody.\n\n**[01:24:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That flesh and biological activity benefits all of the plants around that organism.\n\n**[01:24:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Better for the metal organism may hurt that one individual plant, better for the metal organism, which Indigenous people have been observing for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n**[01:25:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> probably, certainly thousands of years, more than 10,000 years for sure because the ancient form of milpa was developed to when it arrived in Mesoamerica eight to 11,000 years ago depending on who you ask.\n\n**[01:25:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in regenerative grazing, you debush plants a little bit, you get this huge flush of health of that ecosystem.\n\n**[01:25:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> can accelerate the return of desert to grassland through this practice in centropic agroforestry, which is a marriage of ancient indigenous Brazilian agroforestry with some modern ecology, plant physiology knowledge.\n\n**[01:25:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We do centropic pruning of trees.\n\n**[01:25:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so the benefit that we get from regenerative grazing raised by orders of magnitude because of the volume of sugar food and medicine that's being put into the soil food web.\n\n**[01:25:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is a tradition from Brazilian indigenous agroforestry.\n\n**[01:25:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This is a methodology that we got from them that came into centropic agroforestry from indigenous Brazilian agroforestry.\n\n**[01:26:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> of forestry.\n\n**[01:26:01] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And when we increase the, and then you drop all of that, now you're getting lignin, because it's trees, you're getting lignin.\n\n**[01:26:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And lignin feeds the saprophytic fungi who are the ones that, saprophytic fungi at the Earth's surface are who turns lignin into phobic, omic, and cubic substances, which are the magical molecules.\n\n**[01:26:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So now we are creating an environment where fungi can thrive, which is one of the measures of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:26:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And the fungal biomass and the fungal biodiversity are the two main ways we make, we measure ecological succession in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are ways that we observe it with our eyeballs in the plant life above ground.\n\n**[01:26:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There ways that we measure it with the biota and the fungi in the soil.\n\n**[01:26:40] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we're increasing the rate of accumulation of organic matter, biodeversity, and biomass in the soil and in the topsoil.\n\n**[01:26:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And that we accelerate that rate of accumulation.\n\n**[01:26:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And therefore we accelerate the rate at which we can move from plant community A to B to C through the stages of ecological.\n\n**[01:27:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> succession using this ancient Brazilian indigenous agroforestry trick.\n\n**[01:27:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that's one example.\n\n**[01:27:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Mother Tree Food and Forest Research Practice Education.\n\n**[01:27:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I mentioned classes.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> mentioned workshops.\n\n**[01:27:13] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm also developing curricula in the inky education format to see if I can throw some stuff up into the chat.\n\n**[01:27:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> My email address as well.\n\n**[01:27:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If anyone wants to contact me personally, I'd love to talk to any and all of you personally.\n\n**[01:27:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Just have phone conversations and get to know you all and envision how we can empower each other's projects.\n\n**[01:27:45] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm developing curricula K through 12 curricula in the inky education format, which is a beautiful pedagogy developed around really modern progressive development psychology to where we're just making sure that every age group we are only bringing what\n\n**[01:28:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> is fun and interesting to a human being of that age for the purpose of creating a situation where that person feels safe and secure enough and is healthy enough and can attend to self-care well enough that their authentic self is able to express in this lifetime.\n\n**[01:28:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so this is part of a like a low-key spiritualist tradition within Western psychology that comes from Margaret McFarland, that angel that brought that beautiful comprehension to people like Mr.\n\n**[01:28:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Rogers, Fred Rogers, Carl Rogers, Eric Erickson, that the Bessel van der Kolk School of Thought comes from who informs like internal family systems, polyvagal theory, nonviolent communication, compassionate inquiry, all these branches of modern Western psychology that are low-key spiritualist traditions who all have that goal of helping human beings have their authentic self expressed in this lifetime, which is I think a very important part of the decolonization, re-indigenous\n\n**[01:29:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> the healing that we all need in order to help us restore healthy relationships internally, interpersonally, interfamily, intercommunity, and between our species and all the other kinds of divine beings that we are a part of the same organism with.\n\n**[01:29:18] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So that's important to me for that reason.\n\n**[01:29:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm sort of basing this off of Juliana Furchi's work, Fungi Foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Fungiara of Chile.\n\n**[01:29:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi is a brilliant, beautiful mycologist who created mycology curricula that is free that any educator can just add to their biology or whatever in any age K through 12.\n\n**[01:29:41] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I think now they're working on, you know, to post grad and everything they're adding because we're missing mycology curricula in every aspect of school all around the world.\n\n**[01:29:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So I've translated it into multiple languages, free curricula, any education educator can bring in to add to what they're already doing in different forms, whether it be like a day.\n\n**[01:30:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> a week, a month, a whole semester and is freely available and they've translated into many languages.\n\n**[01:30:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Juliana Furchi, Fungi Foundation, they're brilliant and just wonderful people.\n\n**[01:30:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm basing what we're doing in this.\n\n**[01:30:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So this curricula is ecology, agroecology, soil science, basic just energy pathways, nutrient cycling pathways, agroecology, food forestry, ecological restoration with an emphasis on agroforestry and native species reforestation, human reindigenizing and human health curricula K through 12.\n\n**[01:30:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> All for the purpose with the like the unspoken goal of helping humans get their authentic self to express.\n\n**[01:30:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:30:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kathleen's got a got a chance.\n\n**[01:30:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will say I'm your\n\n**[01:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Our website has come a long way, and I'm looking at the resources page of your website.\n\n**[01:31:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There's a lot of good stuff there, some stuff that we should also steal for the eco-restorational lines.\n\n**[01:31:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> In particular, you know, I think this educational theme that you're talking about is so important.\n\n**[01:31:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And figuring out, you know, lucky kids are going to be able to get it directly from you in a context-appropriate way.\n\n**[01:31:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But these are stories that we need to figure out how to share these ways of thinking much more broadly, and the internet is a great tool for that.\n\n**[01:31:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So if you would help us bring together these educational resources, I would love to have a space on the ERA website that acts as a resource of the sort that you also have on your website.\n\n**[01:31:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> John, I would love to do that.\n\n**[01:31:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'd love to do that with you.\n\n**[01:31:57] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I would love to share, I love teaching in every format.\n\n**[01:32:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> in of any group that's willing to hear these stories.\n\n**[01:32:03] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I tell a very coherent story that marries all of the ancient and modern Western science together.\n\n**[01:32:09] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think I can fly through the rest of this quickly.\n\n**[01:32:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm more than halfway through if you think that we still have time.\n\n**[01:32:17] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If you're...\n\n**[01:32:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me ask you to take another five to 10 minutes, not more.\n\n**[01:32:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That will give Kathleen 20 to 25 minutes, which is fair.\n\n**[01:32:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Beautiful, thank you all for your attention and patience.\n\n**[01:32:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm happy to honor that request.\n\n**[01:32:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a project I perceived that the human health and dignity and the ecological health and dignity of the human health, ecological health and dignity definition of the idea of scaling.\n\n**[01:32:50] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> When people ask, is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's a wonderful methodology.\n\n**[01:32:54] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Is this scalable?\n\n**[01:32:55] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I think that the human and ecological health and dignity definition of scaling means to create...\n\n**[01:33:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> A decentralized movement and so there's a decentralized movement that we are spreading around the world called Ote.\n\n**[01:33:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> That's an acronym 100 trees a year.\n\n**[01:33:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're asking every human being on the planet to commit to themself to plant 100 trees a year for the rest of their life.\n\n**[01:33:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> One ask the other ask is that every human being commits to themself to let everybody they know know that we're doing this now because we've deforested the planet and that has destabilized global climate and triggered an extinction event.\n\n**[01:33:30] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And until we get this planet reforested we're asking every human being to just commit to to do it to doing this.\n\n**[01:33:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so we're getting people to create to build tree nurseries in all communities so they can supply the trees for the agro forestry, the food forestry and the native species reforestation projects that our species now has in front of us.\n\n**[01:33:49] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> You can hear about Ote on Mother Tree Food and Forest website.\n\n**[01:33:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Also a board member of an organization called the School of Constructive Arts, which is.\n\n**[01:34:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Basically, right now in Earth Building School, but they're looking at building water, food, energy, waste and eco restoration systems and creating things that are balanced, intelligent, and in the best benefit, helping human beings get their needs met, most simply, most effectively in ways that benefit all beings and help all beings get their needs met.\n\n**[01:34:22] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So, I'm also working with an organization called the Crooked Forest Institute in the southwestern New Mexico, United States, where I live.\n\n**[01:34:33] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And we have similar visions with both of these organizations.\n\n**[01:34:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> We're working towards this Gaviotas, Oroville sort of model where we're combining all of these wise methodologies and all of these areas of life, all of these solutions into new social, living models and trying to demonstrate and create replicable models where all human beings can get their needs met in ways that\n\n**[01:35:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are far superior and in ways that also have all of the other beings that were in ecological societies would get their needs met better.\n\n**[01:35:08] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Cricket Forest Institute School of Constructive Art sees two organizations, web addresses in the chat.\n\n**[01:35:16] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm working in different parts of New Mexico on Miyawaki Reforestation Projects.\n\n**[01:35:21] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I'm in talks with different organizations.\n\n**[01:35:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> This I do natural building.\n\n**[01:35:31] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> build cob houses out of the earth, other forms of natural building.\n\n**[01:35:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There is a project developing in the HeLaWilderness area that I wanted to mention because this relates to Eco-Restoration Alliance and so I'm going to make a proposal to the Eco-Restoration Alliance that they support me and I might ask different members.\n\n**[01:35:52] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I even think that on a call of their own I may ask you for some mentorship and guidance if it were of interest to you in this project.\n\n**[01:35:58] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> If we get to a place in the project\n\n**[01:36:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It might make sense and so basically the nature conservancy unofficially came unofficially came to me to discuss the idea of transitioning from old strategies to modern strategies.\n\n**[01:36:11] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> They bought up a ton of land on one of the largest intact river systems in the United States and have just been renting it to cattle ranchers to graze on because that's what was happening before they bought it up and they did not want to make big stirs in those communities.\n\n**[01:36:25] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> It's been some time and now they want to transition to ecological restoration because conserving degraded ecosystems is lunacy.\n\n**[01:36:36] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so they asked for my help in putting together a large vision and go and yeah.\n\n**[01:36:48] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so what I'm imagining is in short is putting together a system where we a requisite of cattle ranchers renting it is if they agree to receive.\n\n**[01:37:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Training from organizations such as policy management international or Roger savory, who's a member here and maybe teaming with projects that equal restoration alliance has.\n\n**[01:37:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> On their radar with carbon partners and for Tara.\n\n**[01:37:14] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's organizations in where I live, like my organization that would have a lot to contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:20] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are indigenous people in my part of the world who still have some of their relationships to the ecosystems who could contribute to that.\n\n**[01:37:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are organizations that do wonderful things like Johnson's to bioreactors, which could contribute inoculants to help with this.\n\n**[01:37:34] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There are a lot of ways.\n\n**[01:37:35] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> So we would use regenerative grazing to accelerate arrest and ecological restoration through a period of ecological succession.\n\n**[01:37:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And then from there, it would be agroecology, food, forestry, or and most predominantly native species, reforestation using some of the knowledge from Milwaukee reforestation.\n\n**[01:37:53] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> But then working to scale that to be time, money, labor efficiency efficient at scale.\n\n**[01:38:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let me suggest that if you like next week and we can make sure that the saw carbon partners people have been invited that you sort of lay out that hella environment proposition.\n\n**[01:38:19] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, give us what we need in order to know how we can, we can contribute.\n\n**[01:38:24] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Okay, happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:26] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Happy to do that.\n\n**[01:38:27] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> you.\n\n**[01:38:28] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> so to close this, I would like to say that I personally need some help still and all of the work that I'm doing.\n\n**[01:38:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> There's a lot that I haven't mentioned other projects going and I like to support good projects.\n\n**[01:38:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> What I need, I'm asking the universe and I'm asking human beings, just letting people know what I need is a human being who is willing to do what I'm doing the way I'm doing it which at the moment is out of pocket, a spiritual path.\n\n**[01:38:56] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I need to like a media person like a photographer.\n\n**[01:39:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> show media, web design, et cetera, who is willing to with me find funding to pay us to do this work, to create decentralized movements and empower communities everywhere to do all of this agroecology, food, forestry, native species, reforestation, decolonization, human re-indigenizing work, and to really shift the cultural norm in this culture.\n\n**[01:39:29] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> are the most ecologically illiterate country in the world, currently here in the United States, and possibly ever in Earth's history.\n\n**[01:39:37] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And to help us transition to where we have a value of ecological education.\n\n**[01:39:42] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:39:43] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And so I'm looking for a human being to help me with that.\n\n**[01:39:46] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> And I really appreciate everybody's time and interest and these common ethics and goals.\n\n**[01:39:51] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I just, I love being with good-hearted, intelligent people who have attended to self-care so well for so long that they have extra capacities where we can look at things beyond what's\n\n**[01:40:00] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> right in front of us and want to use our privilege to make the world a place for everyone who does not have our privilege.\n\n**[01:40:06] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> I really appreciate and feel love and respect for everybody here.\n\n**[01:40:10] Coakee William Wildcat**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Because it's 20 minutes to the end of our two-hour session and because Kathleen goes next and because Joaquin is going to give us a focus presentation on the Colorado River Hill thing next week, the floor recognizes Kathleen Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How do you pronounce your last name Kathleen?\n\n**[01:40:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Groppi.\n\n**[01:40:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Close.\n\n**[01:40:45] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:40:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Nobody gets it right the first time.\n\n**[01:40:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:40:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And the floor is yours.\n\n**[01:40:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Great.\n\n**[01:40:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Well, that was just a treat to hear you all.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:41:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in Texas y'all to hear y'all sharing things that are near and dear to my heart a lot of you shared I think what I would I recognize in all of you is this deep heartfelt desire to give to help to help educate people and to help heal the planet and in terms of education I'll just before I load my presentation I'll say that I've spent the better part of the last three or four years working on a book and the book is about I don't have a title yet but it's a biological approach to regenerative agriculture and it will address what was mentioned before the fact that many people many farmers for example don't really understand what's going on in their soil and why it's so important to to change\n\n**[01:42:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> their practices.\n\n**[01:42:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it's a very specialized topic topic.\n\n**[01:42:05] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I visualize it's a college textbook and I visualize it being part of like in the agricultural programs.\n\n**[01:42:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's my that's my desire.\n\n**[01:42:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I also have had just been asked by a non-profit foundation out of Florida called the Green Foundation to help them they they're trying to take agriculture into the K through 12 schools with hands on practices and he so I'll be doing the same things I'll be doing that in Texas but in Texas I want to do it more around soil health and I'll be starting with like 4-H and FFA groups, high school age people that I'll bring out to my ranch I have a small ranch South of Dallas and\n\n**[01:43:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I'll bring them out to the ranch and show them how we go about analyzing soil and why that's important and interesting.\n\n**[01:43:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show the reason I told you all that up front is I'm going to show those little presentation that's educational and now you might know.\n\n**[01:43:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You just muted yourself, Kathleen you you press the mute button while you were setting up your screen share.\n\n**[01:43:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Can you hear me.\n\n**[01:43:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There we go.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, good.\n\n**[01:43:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> All right.\n\n**[01:43:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now I don't know how to do this to be honest.\n\n**[01:43:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've not done this before.\n\n**[01:43:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You have done it.\n\n**[01:43:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can you see my slides?\n\n**[01:43:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do.\n\n**[01:43:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Or do you do?\n\n**[01:43:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:43:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay, so we're on number one.\n\n**[01:43:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I'm\n\n**[01:44:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**\n> Okay, so the slides are only partially sharing.\n\n**[01:44:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's okay.\n\n**[01:44:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're not seeing your full slide.\n\n**[01:44:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How about.\n\n**[01:44:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can't see that.\n\n**[01:44:12] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:44:13] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So what, what I'm also doing is small scale compared to all of you.\n\n**[01:44:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Land restoration and.\n\n**[01:44:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And in the subtitle is we bought and up and I'll show you what I mean in a minute.\n\n**[01:44:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> First, I wanted to share that for my PhD.\n\n**[01:44:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, sorry about the weird.\n\n**[01:44:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Weird text.\n\n**[01:44:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> For my PhD work, I worked as part of a, I had mentioned earlier a discipline interdisciplinary group that were studying the effects of global change on ecosystems.\n\n**[01:44:47] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And my.\n\n**[01:44:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Model organism was endophytic fungi.\n\n**[01:44:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so these are fungi that live inside in between.\n\n**[01:44:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You can see it like right here.\n\n**[01:44:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see a wiggling through.\n\n**[01:45:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> in between plant cells.\n\n**[01:45:02] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these fungi give the plant a whole lot of different positive and negative properties, including makes them resistant to being eaten by other organisms, it makes them grow bigger, it does all kinds of things, but it also sterilizes them.\n\n**[01:45:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is it sterilizing it.\n\n**[01:45:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is when the plant starts to flower, these fungal structures come out and surround the flower and make it sterile.\n\n**[01:45:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And so I spent seven years looking at this system and looking at how CO2 and habitat fragmentation affected the way this process played out.\n\n**[01:45:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So at the moment though, I'm interested in what I would call farming microorganisms.\n\n**[01:45:50] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that is not just farming cattle, but farming who lives in the soil.\n\n**[01:45:57] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And some of you will recognize\n\n**[01:46:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> is this actual picture.\n\n**[01:46:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is from Elaine Ingham's work on the soil food web and she's also I'm very much inspired by her and she talks about how everything's interrelated and this is what I want to go into in more detail.\n\n**[01:46:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I'm going to show a few pictures that came from a National Geographic article that I really called meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.\n\n**[01:46:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this one is the most famous I think because it's the cutest.\n\n**[01:46:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a tardigrade and this guy eats nematodes in the soil.\n\n**[01:46:36] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just going tell you what some of these guys do why they're important.\n\n**[01:46:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a springtail.\n\n**[01:46:42] Kathleen Groppe**\n> think he's also cute.\n\n**[01:46:43] Kathleen Groppe**\n> helps break down material that's degrading, decaying in the soil and eventually that becomes nutrients for the plants and for the other members of the soil food web.\n\n**[01:46:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is a nematode.\n\n**[01:46:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He helps among other things praise on insects.\n\n**[01:46:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> He also eats\n\n**[01:47:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> fungi and bacteria, it depends upon the species, but he's down there doing important work and mebibas go along and envelop microorganisms.\n\n**[01:47:10] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is important to keep certain microorganisms in check.\n\n**[01:47:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You don't want anyone getting out of portion in the soil food web.\n\n**[01:47:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Some mites and worms and they help break down woody material.\n\n**[01:47:28] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So I just threw in a bunch of these.\n\n**[01:47:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Microfungi were mentioned earlier and they're certain super important in bringing nutrients and water, for example, to plants and to form a big network of communication in the soil.\n\n**[01:47:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Protezoa, another example, on bacteria.\n\n**[01:47:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So when you have a healthy soil food web, this is from Dr.\n\n**[01:47:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lange's work, you have increased water holding capacity in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that, we know, I think this whole group knows why that's important, but when it rains, you don't want the rain to run off.\n\n**[01:48:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> don't, and you don't want it to sit on top of the soil causing anaerobic conditions.\n\n**[01:48:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You want it to nicely soak into the soil and to stay there.\n\n**[01:48:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And these little organisms I just showed help create.\n\n**[01:48:22] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Aggregates in the soil that help the water percolate and also hang on to water.\n\n**[01:48:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's so less run off, less leaching, higher nutrient availability that suppresses disease reduces use of water and increases the root debt because the plant roots can get deeper and bacteria in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, some degree toxins, and it keeps things aerobic, meaning there's plenty of oxygen in the soil.\n\n**[01:48:56] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Now, this is skipping to my other interest.\n\n**[01:48:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is just.\n\n**[01:49:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> sort of three different things that I'm up to.\n\n**[01:49:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have what's called the land, the Lake Trail Land and Cattle Company.\n\n**[01:49:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That sounds big, but it's very small.\n\n**[01:49:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I have 77 acres, 30 miles south of Dallas, Texas.\n\n**[01:49:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I have a 22 cattle.\n\n**[01:49:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's what we're looking at there.\n\n**[01:49:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> What I wanted to show you about that though, is that when we bought it, it was a dump, literally a dump.\n\n**[01:49:31] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is pictures of our back pasture.\n\n**[01:49:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We bought it with the intention of trying to restore native prairie.\n\n**[01:49:41] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That was ambitious and took a great number of years, but you can see there's everything from these barrels in the left picture were full of hydrochloric acid.\n\n**[01:49:52] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't know why they were out there.\n\n**[01:49:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There were boats, were old trailers.\n\n**[01:49:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There was everything you could think of.\n\n**[01:50:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Lots and lots of tires.\n\n**[01:50:01] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We did a lot of recycling of metal and tires.\n\n**[01:50:04] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a long, very busy project.\n\n**[01:50:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So we removed industrial sized dumpsters of trash, recycled 10 loads of old tires, and we pay them to take them.\n\n**[01:50:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That's the way that works.\n\n**[01:50:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We recycled multiple truckloads of old metal.\n\n**[01:50:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We got a little money for that.\n\n**[01:50:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We repaired a damaged spillway that had the lake that used to be there was empty.\n\n**[01:50:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was dry.\n\n**[01:50:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And now we have over five acres of lake.\n\n**[01:50:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And we also do by annual shredding of the, what the rest that we eventually got.\n\n**[01:50:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's just makes a nice mulch and puts it back into the soil.\n\n**[01:50:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So that's the other things we started with, know, what, and this started in 2011 towards about 2018.\n\n**[01:50:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And this is, this is an old picture.\n\n**[01:51:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Sure, but it shows this is what it looked like after so you saw them before and this is the after You can see the lake in the distance.\n\n**[01:51:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can see there's no trash.\n\n**[01:51:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> know if you walk around our place you'll definitely find bits of trash here and there but it's by and large it's restored And then next phase Our next phase is we added cattle.\n\n**[01:51:27] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This was done in part because my ranch manager who was a dear friend and practically a family member loves cattle and wanted them but we didn't know what cattle would do for our ecosystem and it was a total game changer as we were talking about earlier the cattle the saliva induces plant growth the manure feeds the microbes the microbes in the soil I mean it's a it's it was really pretty phenomenal and we follow Lucy\n\n**[01:52:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We follow savory methods or the holistic management methods where we move the cattle every, we don't do it daily.\n\n**[01:52:08] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We do it every couple of days to new pastures so that the grass doesn't get overgrazed, but, you know, so they're constantly moving along.\n\n**[01:52:19] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So just the benefits of cows, it spreads, prevents the spread of weeds because they like to eat the weeds, promotes growth, introduces carbon into this ecosystem, introduces microorganisms and encored, oh, and this I didn't mention, it encourages the growth of dormant species in part because they trample the ground.\n\n**[01:52:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There's an incredible seed bank that was sitting underneath his dump.\n\n**[01:52:49] Kathleen Groppe**\n> once we put the cows out there, all kinds of great grass species like Indian grass and big blue stem and all the things.\n\n**[01:53:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> People in Texas are proud to see on their pastures.\n\n**[01:53:03] Kathleen Groppe**\n> They all came up only after we put the cows on if you saw the picture before it was a nice grass.\n\n**[01:53:09] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It was a summer grass field, but it didn't have much diversity.\n\n**[01:53:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And from my previous studies, I'm very interested in the topic of diversity and and have done a lot of soil studies on our place to show that diversity changes everything.\n\n**[01:53:29] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It changes productivity.\n\n**[01:53:32] Kathleen Groppe**\n> changes soil respiration.\n\n**[01:53:34] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's it's important.\n\n**[01:53:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so these cows really helped with that.\n\n**[01:53:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> We also added aeration and we have found since then that that was not a great idea.\n\n**[01:53:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And I studied it pretty intensely with a couple of soil tests called the the Haney test and something like PLFK, PLFA that look at the micro organisms in the soil.\n\n**[01:54:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm sort of microorganism centric, and it basically shouldn't, but it does really plow the the pastures up a little bit.\n\n**[01:54:11] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And that's one of the main tenants of regenerative agriculture.\n\n**[01:54:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Don't do that.\n\n**[01:54:15] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And there's a good reason for it.\n\n**[01:54:17] Kathleen Groppe**\n> You can go throughout the place and see where we aerated and where we didn't.\n\n**[01:54:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And erasure is not good.\n\n**[01:54:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Leaving it alone is good because erasure is damaging to the organisms in the soil and many, many levels.\n\n**[01:54:30] Kathleen Groppe**\n> it wasn't a, it wasn't a dramatic.\n\n**[01:54:35] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Plowing, but nonetheless, it wasn't good.\n\n**[01:54:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Not a good idea.\n\n**[01:54:40] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This is what our soil sample sample looks like.\n\n**[01:54:44] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's very elegant.\n\n**[01:54:46] Kathleen Groppe**\n> This, in this particular study, I'm looking at the difference between a ecologically diverse pasture versus a monoculture and seeing how that affects soil life.\n\n**[01:54:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That might be it.\n\n**[01:55:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah, so that's a little rundown track, but some years ago when I was first exposed to regenerative agriculture, I, I had the feeling that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\n**[01:55:14] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I wanted to, I wanted to promote the ideas behind it, not, you know, whatever whatever other ideas incorporate into that.\n\n**[01:55:25] Kathleen Groppe**\n> It's remains to be seen, but to help educate people and particularly farmers, but budding farmers, hopefully as well in the, in grade schools and also in college.\n\n**[01:55:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> And to help them to understand that we're all connected and that goes down to the things we can't see.\n\n**[01:55:48] Kathleen Groppe**\n> So, yeah, I think that's all.\n\n**[01:55:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[01:55:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:55:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you doing that?\n\n**[01:55:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Education and outreach work now.\n\n**[01:55:58] Kathleen Groppe**\n> I'm just, I'm putting together my plan.\n\n**[01:56:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> to start in the fall with it out with the with the high school people.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's great.\n\n**[01:56:06] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:56:07] Kathleen Groppe**\n> How do I get rid of this thing?\n\n**[01:56:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> think there's probably a toolbar up near the top and you can press the stop sharing button.\n\n**[01:56:18] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, it went away.\n\n**[01:56:20] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Let's see.\n\n**[01:56:21] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:23] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Oh, yeah.\n\n**[01:56:24] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Stop sharing.\n\n**[01:56:26] Kathleen Groppe**\n> There you go.\n\n**[01:56:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:56:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, Kathleen, thank you for that presentation.\n\n**[01:56:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for the work you're doing.\n\n**[01:56:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's actually quite an achievement converting that land.\n\n**[01:56:38] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:56:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So does 35 cattle make for a sustainable living for you?\n\n**[01:56:51] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, no way.\n\n**[01:56:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> No way.\n\n**[01:56:53] Kathleen Groppe**\n> Forget it.\n\n**[01:56:54] Kathleen Groppe**\n> check it.\n\n**[01:56:55] Kathleen Groppe**\n> No, it's I hope to pay my ranch hand with the proceeds.\n\n**[01:56:59] Kathleen Groppe**\n> That would be my goal.\n\n**[01:57:00] Kathleen Groppe**\n> But I'm also funded in part by my home business, which is of earth designs and I make Southwestern style jewelry and sell it Yeah, so that, that feeds the, but yeah, it's a lot of different little sources that make us able to live.\n\n**[01:57:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, let me say to you and to Anna, who had to leave, thank you for joining us.\n\n**[01:57:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It'll be nice to have you among our ranks to the presenters.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you very much.\n\n**[01:57:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's actually interesting collection of themes.\n\n**[01:57:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> do want to say that one of the few responsibilities Kathleen of a member of the era as rusted to you for you is to recruit other people who will sort of resonate to the multidisciplinary culture that we're, we're trying to build here.\n\n**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think we are particularly interested, not just in knowing more about this stuff, but somehow finding ways of having real impact on the culture, as well as on the Earth's biology, and we're figuring out as we go along.\n\n**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So I'll just thank everyone for being here.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will take the one minute remains to see if anyone has any shout outs that they want to share to the community.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Otherwise, we're done.\n\n**[01:58:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> All right.\n\n**[01:58:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, everybody.\n\n**[01:58:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Good to see you.\n\n**[01:58:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will meet a week from now.\n\n**[01:58:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Key and Evan are both going to be presenting.\n\n**[01:58:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be others as well.\n\n**[01:58:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will of course send out an agenda.\n\n**[01:58:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's a disruption of our calendar.\n\n**[01:58:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I hope to see you then.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Bye.\n\n**[01:58:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks, everyone.\n\n**[01:58:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n**[01:58:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, Rose.\n\n**[01:58:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n---\n---\n---",
