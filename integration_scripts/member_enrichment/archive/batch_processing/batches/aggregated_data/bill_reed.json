ecosystems and the human spirit.\n\n**[00:07:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Great.\n\n**[00:07:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you.\n\n**[00:07:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, I'm delighted you're here.\n\n**[00:07:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will be I'm going to make a note to follow up so that I can invite you to tell your story to us because as you know, Michael may not this is both our town hall meeting ongoing seminar and.\n\n**[00:07:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Initiation ritual where it's an opportunity for mutual discernment where for people who might like to be affiliated with the restoration Alliance introduced themselves and then when there are no objections as has been the case, they become full fledged members of the or a well the rights and responsibilities there to.\n\n**[00:07:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:07:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob delay.\n\n**[00:07:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who actually pronounces his name, Rob the left, but what does he know.\n\n**[00:07:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Is where you.\n\n**[00:08:01] Rob De Laet**\n> I'm in Amsterdam.\n\n**[00:08:03] Rob De Laet**\n> Hello everybody.\n\n**[00:08:05] Rob De Laet**\n> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.\n\n**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.\n\n**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.\n\n**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.\n\n**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, hello, Kwaki.\n\n**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning.\n\n**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning, everybody.\n\n**[00:09:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Pierre, associated with Alex by this is my memory test, my mental status exam.\n\n**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.\n\n**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've been following you on social media.\n\n**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.\n\n**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.\n\n**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Ali bin Shahid.\n\n**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think is also on the Bezos grant.\n\n**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.\n\n**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.\n\n**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.\n\n**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.\n\n**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.\n\n**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.\n\n**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.\n\n**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.\n\n**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.\n\n**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.\n\n**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.\n\n**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**\n> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.\n\n**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**\n> And then went on to do biology.\n\n**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**\n> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.\n\n**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.\n\n**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**\n> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.\n\n**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.\n\n**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.\n\n**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.\n\n**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**\n> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.\n\n**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.\n\n**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**\n> So living material is an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**\n> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.\n\n**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**\n> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.\n\n**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**\n> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.\n\n**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**\n> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.\n\n**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**\n> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.\n\n**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**\n> And specifically, want to emphasize\n\n**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.\n\n**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**\n> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.\n\n**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**\n> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.\n\n**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**\n> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.\n\n**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**\n> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.\n\n**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**\n> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.\n\n**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> And I will talk about that.\n\n**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.\n\n**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**\n> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.\n\n**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**\n> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.\n\n**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**\n> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.\n\n**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**\n> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.\n\n**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**\n> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.\n\n**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**\n> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.\n\n**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**\n> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**\n> I also think that this can.\n\n**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**\n> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.\n\n**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**\n> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.\n\n**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.\n\n**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**\n> It actually gets much weirder than that.\n\n**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**\n> So let's begin.\n\n**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.\n\n**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.\n\n**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**\n> So there are a couple of things going on here.\n\n**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**\n> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.\n\n**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**\n> we know where\n\n**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**\n> all the animals are here.\n\n**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**\n> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.\n\n**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**\n> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.\n\n**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**\n> We know where all the minds are here.\n\n**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**\n> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.\n\n**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**\n> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.\n\n**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**\n> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't God do it?\n\n**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?\n\n**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**\n> Why did Adam have to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**\n> I think there are two interesting things here.\n\n**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**\n> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.\n\n**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**\n> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.\n\n**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**\n> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.\n\n**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**\n> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have\n\n**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.\n\n**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**\n> so that part we should stick with.\n\n**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**\n> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.\n\n**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**\n> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.\n\n**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**\n> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.\n\n**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**\n> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.\n\n**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?\n\n**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?\n\n**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**\n> How far back here would you like to extend it?\n\n**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**\n> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.\n\n**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.\n\n**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**\n> How did you get from here to here.\n\n**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**\n> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.\n\n**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.\n\n**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.\n\n**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**\n> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.\n\n**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.\n\n**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**\n> And you will have other kinds of beings.\n\n**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**\n> So we'll get to that.\n\n**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm working on a framework.\n\n**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.\n\n**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.\n\n**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**\n> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.\n\n**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**\n> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.\n\n**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**\n> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**\n> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**\n> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.\n\n**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?\n\n**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.\n\n**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**\n> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.\n\n**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**\n> It has to be experimentally valuable.\n\n**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has to move discovery forward.\n\n**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.\n\n**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.\n\n**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...\n\n**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> or pleasant or whatever.\n\n**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**\n> It actually has very practical consequences.\n\n**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**\n> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.\n\n**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**\n> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.\n\n**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**\n> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.\n\n**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**\n> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.\n\n**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.\n\n**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> and are trainable by experiences.\n\n**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.\n\n**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.\n\n**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**\n> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?\n\n**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**\n> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.\n\n**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.\n\n**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**\n> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.\n\n**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**\n> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.\n\n**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**\n> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically\n\n**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.\n\n**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**\n> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.\n\n**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**\n> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.\n\n**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**\n> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.\n\n**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**\n> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> scaling?\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?\n\n**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**\n> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.\n\n**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**\n> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?\n\n**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**\n> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.\n\n**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**\n> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked\n\n**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems\n\n**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.\n\n**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**\n> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.\n\n**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**\n> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.\n\n**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.\n\n**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**\n> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.\n\n**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.\n\n**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**\n> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.\n\n**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> These kinds of systems navigate.\n\n**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**\n> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.\n\n**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**\n> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.\n\n**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**\n> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**\n> and so on.\n\n**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**\n> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.\n\n**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**\n> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.\n\n**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**\n> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**\n> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.\n\n**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**\n> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.\n\n**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**\n> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.\n\n**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**\n> Michael.\n\n**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?\n\n**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**\n> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.\n\n**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this works in real life.\n\n**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**\n> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**\n> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.\n\n**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**\n> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.\n\n**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**\n> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**\n> It really doesn't take much.\n\n**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**\n> And so going to,\n\n**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**\n> beyond the single cell level.\n\n**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**\n> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.\n\n**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**\n> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.\n\n**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**\n> This is a cross-section through an adult human.\n\n**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**\n> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.\n\n**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where does this come from?\n\n**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**\n> How do these cells know to build all of this?\n\n**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.\n\n**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**\n> We have this genome.\n\n**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**\n> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.\n\n**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**\n> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.\n\n**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**\n> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.\n\n**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**\n> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.\n\n**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**\n> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.\n\n**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are the results of...\n\n**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**\n> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.\n\n**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now we need to know a few things.\n\n**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**\n> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know when to stop?\n\n**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**\n> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?\n\n**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**\n> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?\n\n**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**\n> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?\n\n**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**\n> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.\n\n**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**\n> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.\n\n**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?\n\n**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**\n> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.\n\n**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**\n> Now, the obvious biomedical.\n\n**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**\n> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.\n\n**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**\n> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.\n\n**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**\n> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.\n\n**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**\n> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.\n\n**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**\n> You're not going to try to micromanage this.\n\n**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**\n> This is a communications device.\n\n**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.\n\n**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**\n> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.\n\n**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**\n> What is it capable of doing?\n\n**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**\n> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.\n\n**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**\n> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.\n\n**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**\n> let's get it back.\n\n**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**\n> And why is that?\n\n**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.\n\n**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**\n> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**\n> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**\n> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.\n\n**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.\n\n**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**\n> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.\n\n**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**\n> But all of this has not yet been exploited.\n\n**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**\n> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.\n\n**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**\n> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> some sense.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**\n> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.\n\n**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**\n> So let's do a definition first.\n\n**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**\n> I like William James's definition of intelligence.\n\n**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.\n\n**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**\n> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.\n\n**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**\n> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.\n\n**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**\n> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.\n\n**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**\n> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the\n\n**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.\n\n**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**\n> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.\n\n**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**\n> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?\n\n**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.\n\n**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**\n> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.\n\n**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**\n> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.\n\n**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**\n> What we have here is something different, which is that\n\n**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.\n\n**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**\n> That's because the system can do something quite clever.\n\n**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**\n> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.\n\n**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.\n\n**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**\n> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.\n\n**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**\n> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.\n\n**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**\n> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.\n\n**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how these twins are naturally born.\n\n**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**\n> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.\n\n**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.\n\n**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**\n> And if you amputate anywhere along this.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> this limb.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.\n\n**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**\n> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?\n\n**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**\n> So at any position, you can do this.\n\n**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**\n> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.\n\n**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**\n> That's the most amazing part of all of this.\n\n**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**\n> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> When does it stop?\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.\n\n**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**\n> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**\n> You're here.\n\n**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**\n> It immediately recognizes the delta.\n\n**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**\n> It starts to reduce that error.\n\n**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**\n> So you've got an error minimization scheme.\n\n**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.\n\n**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**\n> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.\n\n**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how you recognize goals.\n\n**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**\n> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is\n\n**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**\n> its emergent complexity.\n\n**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**\n> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.\n\n**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**\n> That's not intelligence.\n\n**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**\n> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.\n\n**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**\n> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.\n\n**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**\n> And that's what happens here.\n\n**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**\n> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.\n\n**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**\n> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.\n\n**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**\n> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.\n\n**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**\n> Human livers are highly regenerative.\n\n**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**\n> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.\n\n**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**\n> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.\n\n**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**\n> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.\n\n**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**\n> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> things.\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.\n\n**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**\n> Here's where every cell goes.\n\n**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**\n> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.\n\n**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**\n> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?\n\n**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?\n\n**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**\n> I'll show you both of those things.\n\n**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**\n> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?\n\n**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**\n> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.\n\n**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**\n> are they cooperating?\n\n**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**\n> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.\n\n**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**\n> So just imagine you've got this rat.\n\n**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**\n> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.\n\n**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**\n> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.\n\n**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**\n> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.\n\n**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**\n> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.\n\n**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**\n> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.\n\n**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**\n> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that\n\n**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**\n> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.\n\n**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.\n\n**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**\n> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.\n\n**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?\n\n**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**\n> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?\n\n**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**\n> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.\n\n**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**\n> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.\n\n**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**\n> It's the electrical network.\n\n**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,\n\n**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**\n> is implemented by electrical networks.\n\n**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**\n> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.\n\n**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**\n> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.\n\n**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**\n> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.\n\n**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**\n> It's quite amazing.\n\n**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**\n> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.\n\n**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**\n> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.\n\n**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**\n> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.\n\n**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**\n> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.\n\n**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.\n\n**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**\n> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> it turns\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.\n\n**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**\n> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.\n\n**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**\n> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.\n\n**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**\n> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.\n\n**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**\n> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.\n\n**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**\n> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.\n\n**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**\n> What were these networks thinking about?\n\n**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**\n> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?\n\n**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**\n> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.\n\n**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**\n> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.\n\n**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**\n> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.\n\n**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not a simulation.\n\n**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**\n> This is real animal.\n\n**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**\n> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.\n\n**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.\n\n**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**\n> I want to show you what they look like.\n\n**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**\n> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**\n> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.\n\n**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**\n> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.\n\n**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**\n> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.\n\n**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.\n\n**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**\n> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.\n\n**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**\n> This is where the mouth is going to go.\n\n**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**\n> There's some other placode structures that come out here.\n\n**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.\n\n**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**\n> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.\n\n**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.\n\n**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**\n> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop\n\n**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**\n> on it and to try to decode it.\n\n**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**\n> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.\n\n**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.\n\n**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**\n> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.\n\n**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**\n> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.\n\n**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**\n> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.\n\n**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**\n> And we now have the tools.\n\n**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**\n> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.\n\n**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**\n> So now we can finally answer the question.\n\n**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.\n\n**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.\n\n**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**\n> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?\n\n**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**\n> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.\n\n**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**\n> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.\n\n**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**\n> So from this, we learn three things.\n\n**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.\n\n**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**\n> If you use those same\n\n**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**\n> signals elsewhere in the body.\n\n**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**\n> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.\n\n**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**\n> I could show you lots of other organs.\n\n**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**\n> Second, it's modular.\n\n**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.\n\n**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.\n\n**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**\n> We spoke to them at a very high level.\n\n**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**\n> We said, build an eye here.\n\n**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**\n> That is a very high level subroutine call.\n\n**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**\n> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.\n\n**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is not micromanagement.\n\n**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the genes.\n\n**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the cells.\n\n**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**\n> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.\n\n**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk later.\n\n**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**\n> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.\n\n**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk about how you might do that.\n\n**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...\n\n**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**\n> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.\n\n**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**\n> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?\n\n**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**\n> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.\n\n**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.\n\n**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**\n> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.\n\n**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**\n> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of\n\n**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**\n> participants and so on.\n\n**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**\n> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about\n\n**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**\n> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.\n\n**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**\n> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.\n\n**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**\n> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.\n\n**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**\n> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us\n\n**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**\n> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.\n\n**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**\n> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.\n\n**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.\n\n**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**\n> They are immortal.\n\n**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**\n> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.\n\n**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**\n> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.\n\n**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**\n> They've been around for 400 million years.\n\n**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**\n> These are them.\n\n**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**\n> They do not age and die.\n\n**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.\n\n**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**\n> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.\n\n**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's supposed to be the other way around.\n\n**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**\n> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.\n\n**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**\n> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.\n\n**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**\n> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.\n\n**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**\n> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**\n> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.\n\n**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**\n> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.\n\n**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**\n> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**\n> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.\n\n**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**\n> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.\n\n**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**\n> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.\n\n**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**\n> You can say, no, you should have two heads.\n\n**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**\n> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.\n\n**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.\n\n**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**\n> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.\n\n**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**\n> This is not AI or Photoshop.\n\n**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**\n> These are real animals.\n\n**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**\n> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.\n\n**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**\n> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.\n\n**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.\n\n**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**\n> Yep\n\n**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.\n\n**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> can do that.\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**\n> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.\n\n**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.\n\n**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.\n\n**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.\n\n**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is this is their only now.\n\n**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.\n\n**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**\n> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yep.\n\n**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**\n> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.\n\n**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**\n> Why?\n\n**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**\n> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could\n\n**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**\n> continuously cut them in plain water.\n\n**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**\n> No more manipulation of any kind.\n\n**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**\n> They remain two-headed.\n\n**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.\n\n**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**\n> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**\n> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**\n> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.\n\n**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**\n> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?\n\n**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**\n> And the genomes are exactly identical.\n\n**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing wrong with them.\n\n**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**\n> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?\n\n**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**\n> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.\n\n**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**\n> Not only can you, not only can you\n\n**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**\n> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.\n\n**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**\n> So these are derocephalus.\n\n**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**\n> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.\n\n**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**\n> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.\n\n**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**\n> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.\n\n**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**\n> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?\n\n**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**\n> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.\n\n**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**\n> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.\n\n**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**\n> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.\n\n**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**\n> You don't have to even be\n\n**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**\n> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.\n\n**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.\n\n**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**\n> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.\n\n**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**\n> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.\n\n**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**\n> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.\n\n**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**\n> We would have never known that.\n\n**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**\n> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.\n\n**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**\n> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.\n\n**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**\n> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.\n\n**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**\n> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.\n\n**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**\n> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?\n\n**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.\n\n**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**\n> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.\n\n**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**\n> So lots of evolution going on.\n\n**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**\n> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.\n\n**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**\n> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.\n\n**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**\n> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.\n\n**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**\n> They're put in a little depression.\n\n**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**\n> They could have done many things.\n\n**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**\n> They could have died.\n\n**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**\n> They could have spread away from each other.\n\n**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**\n> They could have formed a flat monolayer.\n\n**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**\n> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.\n\n**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**\n> We call it a xenobot.\n\n**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**\n> Xenobot because Xenopus later.\n\n**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**\n> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.\n\n**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**\n> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.\n\n**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**\n> So they're coordinated to swim.\n\n**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**\n> They can go in circles like this.\n\n**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**\n> They can go back and forth like this.\n\n**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**\n> And remember, this is just skin.\n\n**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**\n> There's no, these are epithelial cells.\n\n**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**\n> There is no neurons here.\n\n**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing else.\n\n**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have collective behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**\n> They can interact with each other.\n\n**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**\n> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.\n\n**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**\n> They can have individual behaviors and so on.\n\n**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.\n\n**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**\n> So it floats down here.\n\n**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**\n> It's swimming along.\n\n**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**\n> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.\n\n**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**\n> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff\n\n**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**\n> here are just the dissociated skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**\n> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.\n\n**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**\n> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.\n\n**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**\n> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?\n\n**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**\n> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.\n\n**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**\n> This is called kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**\n> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.\n\n**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is completely novel.\n\n**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**\n> We did not teach them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**\n> We did not have to force them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**\n> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.\n\n**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**\n> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**\n> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.\n\n**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?\n\n**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**\n> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.\n\n**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**\n> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.\n\n**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**\n> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.\n\n**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**\n> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**\n> They do have a developmental sequence.\n\n**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**\n> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.\n\n**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**\n> I have no idea.\n\n**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**\n> And they have these behaviors.\n\n**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**\n> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.\n\n**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.\n\n**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**\n> All of this emerges spontaneously.\n\n**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just complexity.\n\n**[01:03:46] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to put together a coherent organism with adaptive behaviors that functions in novel circumstances you've never seen before.\n\n**[01:04:00] Michael Levin**\n> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.\n\n**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.\n\n**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**\n> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.\n\n**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**\n> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings\n\n**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**\n> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.\n\n**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**\n> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.\n\n**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**\n> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.\n\n**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**\n> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.\n\n**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**\n> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for\n\n**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**\n> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.\n\n**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**\n> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.\n\n**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**\n> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.\n\n**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are possible.\n\n**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**\n> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.\n\n**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**\n> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.\n\n**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**\n> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.\n\n**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**\n> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.\n\n**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**\n> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.\n\n**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**\n> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.\n\n**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**\n> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**\n> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.\n\n**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**\n> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.\n\n**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**\n> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.\n\n**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**\n> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.\n\n**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**\n> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.\n\n**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**\n> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.\n\n**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**\n> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.\n\n**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**\n> I was looking for...\n\n**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**\n> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.\n\n**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**\n> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.\n\n**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**\n> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.\n\n**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**\n> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.\n\n**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**\n> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.\n\n**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**\n> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.\n\n**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...\n\n**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**\n> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.\n\n**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**\n> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.\n\n**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**\n> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.\n\n**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**\n> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.\n\n**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**\n> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.\n\n**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**\n> imagine something.\n\n**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**\n> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**\n> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**\n> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.\n\n**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**\n> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.\n\n**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**\n> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.\n\n**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**\n> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.\n\n**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**\n> It's like a plasmode.\n\n**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**\n> very rarefied plasma.\n\n**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**\n> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.\n\n**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**\n> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.\n\n**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**\n> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.\n\n**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**\n> And we don't even see it.\n\n**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of information.\n\n**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**\n> They're not real, like us.\n\n**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.\n\n**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**\n> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.\n\n**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**\n> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.\n\n**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**\n> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.\n\n**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**\n> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.\n\n**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**\n> And the others say, well, that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**\n> We're real organisms.\n\n**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**\n> We're solid.\n\n**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**\n> Patterns in gas can't be agents.\n\n**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**\n> What do you mean patterns?\n\n**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**\n> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?\n\n**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**\n> says, well, about 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**\n> But that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**\n> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**\n> That's too short.\n\n**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**\n> so what I think\n\n**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**\n> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.\n\n**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**\n> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.\n\n**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.\n\n**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**\n> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.\n\n**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.\n\n**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**\n> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.\n\n**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**\n> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.\n\n**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> these systems.\n\n**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**\n> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.\n\n**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**\n> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?\n\n**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**\n> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.\n\n**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**\n> So here's where I'll end.\n\n**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**\n> What I tried to tell you today is this.\n\n**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**\n> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.\n\n**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**\n> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.\n\n**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.\n\n**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**\n> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.\n\n**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**\n> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.\n\n**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**\n> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.\n\n**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**\n> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.\n\n**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.\n\n**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.\n\n**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.\n\n**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**\n> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.\n\n**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**\n> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.\n\n**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**\n> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.\n\n**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**\n> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.\n\n**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> These are two companies that support this work.\n\n**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**\n> So I thank you.\n\n**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Wow.\n\n**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could- Thank you.\n\n**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?\n\n**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**\n> I have a few minutes.\n\n**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.\n\n**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Really nice.\n\n**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm going to let other people go first.\n\n**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I'm loaded with questions.\n\n**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**\n> Alex.\n\n**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.\n\n**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**\n> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.\n\n**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**\n> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.\n\n**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**\n> So that's what takes me into biology.\n\n**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**\n> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.\n\n**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**\n> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.\n\n**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think that's exactly right.\n\n**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**\n> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.\n\n**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**\n> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.\n\n**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**\n> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.\n\n**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?\n\n**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**\n> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?\n\n**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**\n> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.\n\n**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**\n> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.\n\n**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**\n> But they can access these things.\n\n**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**\n> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.\n\n**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**\n> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?\n\n**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**\n> So last question, are we machines ourselves?\n\n**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**\n> Are we technologies of the natural world?\n\n**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**\n> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.\n\n**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**\n> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.\n\n**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is not what machines are.\n\n**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?\n\n**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**\n> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.\n\n**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**\n> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.\n\n**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**\n> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and\n\n**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.\n\n**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Both of those are true.\n\n**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob?\n\n**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**\n> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you, wonderful.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.\n\n**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**\n> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.\n\n**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?\n\n**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good question.\n\n**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**\n> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.\n\n**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.\n\n**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**\n> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.\n\n**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**\n> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.\n\n**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**\n> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.\n\n**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> like this.\n\n**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**\n> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.\n\n**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**\n> Let's take that last example.\n\n**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**\n> So they donate their lung and their trachea.\n\n**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**\n> We buy those cells from a company.\n\n**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**\n> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.\n\n**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**\n> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.\n\n**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**\n> They look kind of like xenobots.\n\n**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**\n> They have some different behaviors.\n\n**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> They have some amazing capabilities.\n\n**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**\n> They can heal neural wounds.\n\n**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**\n> do all kinds of wild stuff.\n\n**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**\n> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?\n\n**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**\n> So the original patient is perhaps dead.\n\n**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> Their cells are not dead.\n\n**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**\n> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.\n\n**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**\n> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?\n\n**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Where is this supposed to go?\n\n**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**\n> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,\n\n**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.\n\n**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**\n> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.\n\n**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**\n> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.\n\n**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**\n> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.\n\n**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**\n> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.\n\n**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**\n> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.\n\n**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**\n> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.\n\n**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> For example, we get tissue from smokers.\n\n**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**\n> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?\n\n**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**\n> You know, it's about a million questions.\n\n**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**\n> death is, yeah, I don't know.\n\n**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**\n> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.\n\n**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**\n> Wonderful, thank you.\n\n**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks.\n\n**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.\n\n**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**\n> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.\n\n**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And if so,\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?\n\n**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**\n> How are they being generated?\n\n**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, great question.\n\n**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**\n> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.\n\n**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**\n> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.\n\n**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**\n> OK, let's say they don't.\n\n**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**\n> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.\n\n**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**\n> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.\n\n**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**\n> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?\n\n**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.\n\n**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?\n\n**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.\n\n**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**\n> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?\n\n**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**\n> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.\n\n**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**\n> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.\n\n**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**\n> They get to the bottom.\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> What do they do?\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> make a beautiful bell curve, right?\n\n**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**\n> They make a Gaussian distribution.\n\n**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**\n> So now you can ask a simple question.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, that's a nice shape.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Where did that come from?\n\n**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**\n> So you're looking at the marbles.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the nails.\n\n**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the wood.\n\n**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**\n> Also not there.\n\n**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where did it come from, right?\n\n**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.\n\n**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**\n> Where is that?\n\n**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**\n> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.\n\n**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**\n> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**\n> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?\n\n**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.\n\n**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> And that's great.\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> Well, guess what?\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> You don't need to look for the third angle.\n\n**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**\n> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.\n\n**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**\n> So where is that?\n\n**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?\n\n**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some philosophical fluff.\n\n**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**\n> This is super practical.\n\n**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**\n> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.\n\n**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**\n> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.\n\n**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**\n> there are three things we need to track.\n\n**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.\n\n**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.\n\n**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not sure.\n\n**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.\n\n**[01:24:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They come from wherever the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My turn.\n\n**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.\n\n**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.\n\n**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.\n\n**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.\n\n**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.\n\n**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.\n\n**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.\n\n**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.\n\n**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> doesn't have to be.\n\n**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?\n\n**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**\n> Absolutely.\n\n**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.\n\n**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.\n\n**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**\n> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?\n\n**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**\n> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.\n\n**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**\n> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.\n\n**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**\n> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.\n\n**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.\n\n**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**\n> So, you know,\n\n**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.\n\n**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**\n> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.\n\n**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**\n> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.\n\n**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?\n\n**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?\n\n**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do anticipation?\n\n**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do generalization?\n\n**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do associative learning?\n\n**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**\n> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.\n\n**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> We could start with models.\n\n**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**\n> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.\n\n**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**\n> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.\n\n**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> And I think you can learn a lot from that.\n\n**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.\n\n**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**\n> Sure, cool.\n\n**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, thank you so much.\n\n**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.\n\n**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**\n> you.\n\n**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**\n> All right, bye bye.\n\n**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Deep breath.\n\n**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for hanging in.\n\n**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.\n\n**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.\n\n**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.\n\n**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing\n\n**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.\n\n**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The steering committee looked at his proposal.\n\n**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.\n\n**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's really making progress.\n\n**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.\n\n**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.\n\n**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He needs a mere another $4,500.\n\n**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can we help him go over the edge?\n\n**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.\n\n**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.\n\n**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.\n\n**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.\n\n**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The floor is yours.\n\n**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.\n\n**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.\n\n**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Thank you, John, and everyone.\n\n**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I think my network is okay.\n\n**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.\n\n**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I know we are all exhausted.\n\n**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to\n\n**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.\n\n**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.\n\n**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.\n\n**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a\n\n**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.\n\n**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.\n\n**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.\n\n**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.\n\n**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.\n\n**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.\n\n**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.\n\n**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Like currently, basically the characteristics.\n\n**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.\n\n**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.\n\n**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.\n\n**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so\n\n**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.\n\n**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.\n\n**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.\n\n**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.\n\n**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.\n\n**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.\n\n**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.\n\n**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.\n\n**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.\n\n**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.\n\n**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.\n\n**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is\n\n**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.\n\n**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.\n\n**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.\n\n**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.\n\n**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.\n\n**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.\n\n**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.\n\n**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> It can be\n\n**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.\n\n**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.\n\n**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.\n\n**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.\n\n**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.\n\n**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> culture, but you're doing other things.\n\n**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.\n\n**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.\n\n**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.\n\n**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.\n\n**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.\n\n**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar\n\n**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> the region.\n\n**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.\n\n**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.\n\n**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.\n\n**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.\n\n**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.\n\n**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> because the number of land to be exploited.\n\n**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.\n\n**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.\n\n**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.\n\n**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.\n\n**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.\n\n**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.\n\n**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's it.\n\n**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.\n\n**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.\n\n**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...\n\n**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.\n\n**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.\n\n**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after you command to national forest.\n\n**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> that's why my last slide.\n\n**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.\n\n**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Before, make sure our dream comes true.\n\n**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.\n\n**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.\n\n**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.\n\n**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.\n\n**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.\n\n**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.\n\n**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.\n\n**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.\n\n**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.\n\n**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.\n\n**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?\n\n**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?\n\n**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.\n\n**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.\n\n**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The cover trees and which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yes, as we're also making\n\n**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.\n\n**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.\n\n**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.\n\n**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.\n\n**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob.\n\n**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**\n> I thank you for great work.\n\n**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**\n> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.\n\n**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**\n> The 2nd 1.\n\n**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**\n> You can ask that straight away.\n\n**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will create.\n\n**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will.\n\n**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?\n\n**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.\n\n**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.\n\n**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's the short answer to your question.\n\n**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**\n> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.\n\n**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.\n\n**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**\n> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.\n\n**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**\n> I am certainly not an expert.\n\n**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**\n> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.\n\n**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**\n> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.\n\n**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that is something.\n\n**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a timely question.\n\n**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.\n\n**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.\n\n**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.\n\n**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.\n\n**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin.\n\n**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.\n\n**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**\n> That's very inspiring.\n\n**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.\n\n**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.\n\n**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.\n\n**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.\n\n**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**\n> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.\n\n**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**\n> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.\n\n**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.\n\n**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?\n\n**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What would a long-term region be for that?\n\n**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.\n\n**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.\n\n**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some\n\n**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.\n\n**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, so we will proceed with this.\n\n**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.\n\n**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.\n\n**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the work here?\n\n**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the actual planting?\n\n**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Do they get paid and so on?\n\n**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How does the labor component figure into this?\n\n**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're\n\n**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.\n\n**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.\n\n**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.\n\n**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?\n\n**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.\n\n**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.\n\n**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.\n\n**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> in our planning, we have\n\n**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.\n\n**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.\n\n**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.\n\n**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.\n\n**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.\n\n**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.\n\n**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.\n\n**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.\n\n**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.\n\n**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.\n\n**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.\n\n**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.\n\n**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.\n\n**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.\n\n**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.\n\n**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.\n\n**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.\n\n**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**\n> I just have a question.\n\n**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.\n\n**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**\n> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?\n\n**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**\n> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.\n\n**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,\n\n**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.\n\n**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.\n\n**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.\n\n**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.\n\n**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.\n\n**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.\n\n**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that would be one of the story.\n\n**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they\n\n**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.\n\n**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.\n\n**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.\n\n**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.\n\n**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, this is our website You\n\n**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.\n\n**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.\n\n**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the test.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If I search for Colombo, there he is.\n\n**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this is the information we have.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.\n\n**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.\n\n**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.\n\n**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.\n\n**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be basically a member space and a public space.\n\n**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.\n\n**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.\n\n**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.\n\n**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.\n\n**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also say that once we have a directory.\n\n**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're going to start encouraging members to become.\n\n**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.\n\n**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.\n\n**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.\n\n**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.\n\n**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.\n\n**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.\n\n**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's 10.56.\n\n**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I have no other items that I really want to get to.\n\n**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you everybody.\n\n**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks for being here.\n\n**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

everybody.\n\n**[00:08:05] Rob De Laet**\n> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.\n\n**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.\n\n**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.\n\n**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.\n\n**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, hello, Kwaki.\n\n**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning.\n\n**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning, everybody.\n\n**[00:09:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Pierre, associated with Alex by this is my memory test, my mental status exam.\n\n**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.\n\n**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've been following you on social media.\n\n**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.\n\n**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.\n\n**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Ali bin Shahid.\n\n**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think is also on the Bezos grant.\n\n**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.\n\n**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.\n\n**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.\n\n**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.\n\n**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.\n\n**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.\n\n**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.\n\n**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.\n\n**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.\n\n**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.\n\n**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.\n\n**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**\n> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.\n\n**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**\n> And then went on to do biology.\n\n**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**\n> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.\n\n**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.\n\n**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**\n> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.\n\n**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.\n\n**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.\n\n**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.\n\n**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**\n> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.\n\n**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.\n\n**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**\n> So living material is an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**\n> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.\n\n**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**\n> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.\n\n**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**\n> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.\n\n**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**\n> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.\n\n**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**\n> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.\n\n**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**\n> And specifically, want to emphasize\n\n**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.\n\n**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**\n> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.\n\n**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**\n> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.\n\n**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**\n> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.\n\n**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**\n> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.\n\n**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**\n> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.\n\n**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> And I will talk about that.\n\n**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.\n\n**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**\n> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.\n\n**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**\n> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.\n\n**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**\n> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.\n\n**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**\n> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.\n\n**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**\n> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.\n\n**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**\n> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.\n\n**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**\n> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**\n> I also think that this can.\n\n**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**\n> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.\n\n**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**\n> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.\n\n**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.\n\n**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**\n> It actually gets much weirder than that.\n\n**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**\n> So let's begin.\n\n**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.\n\n**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.\n\n**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**\n> So there are a couple of things going on here.\n\n**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**\n> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.\n\n**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**\n> we know where\n\n**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**\n> all the animals are here.\n\n**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**\n> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.\n\n**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**\n> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.\n\n**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**\n> We know where all the minds are here.\n\n**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**\n> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.\n\n**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**\n> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.\n\n**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**\n> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't God do it?\n\n**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?\n\n**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**\n> Why did Adam have to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**\n> I think there are two interesting things here.\n\n**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**\n> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.\n\n**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**\n> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.\n\n**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**\n> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.\n\n**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**\n> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have\n\n**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.\n\n**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**\n> so that part we should stick with.\n\n**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**\n> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.\n\n**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**\n> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.\n\n**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**\n> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.\n\n**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**\n> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.\n\n**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?\n\n**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?\n\n**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**\n> How far back here would you like to extend it?\n\n**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**\n> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.\n\n**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.\n\n**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**\n> How did you get from here to here.\n\n**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**\n> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.\n\n**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.\n\n**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.\n\n**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**\n> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.\n\n**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.\n\n**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**\n> And you will have other kinds of beings.\n\n**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**\n> So we'll get to that.\n\n**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm working on a framework.\n\n**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.\n\n**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.\n\n**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**\n> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.\n\n**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**\n> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.\n\n**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**\n> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**\n> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**\n> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.\n\n**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?\n\n**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.\n\n**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**\n> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.\n\n**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**\n> It has to be experimentally valuable.\n\n**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has to move discovery forward.\n\n**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.\n\n**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.\n\n**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...\n\n**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> or pleasant or whatever.\n\n**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**\n> It actually has very practical consequences.\n\n**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**\n> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.\n\n**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**\n> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.\n\n**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**\n> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.\n\n**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**\n> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.\n\n**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.\n\n**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> and are trainable by experiences.\n\n**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.\n\n**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.\n\n**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**\n> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?\n\n**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**\n> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.\n\n**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.\n\n**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**\n> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.\n\n**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**\n> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.\n\n**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**\n> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically\n\n**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.\n\n**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**\n> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.\n\n**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**\n> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.\n\n**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**\n> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.\n\n**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**\n> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> scaling?\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?\n\n**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**\n> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.\n\n**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**\n> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?\n\n**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**\n> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.\n\n**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**\n> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked\n\n**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems\n\n**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.\n\n**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**\n> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.\n\n**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**\n> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.\n\n**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.\n\n**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**\n> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.\n\n**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.\n\n**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**\n> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.\n\n**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> These kinds of systems navigate.\n\n**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**\n> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.\n\n**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**\n> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.\n\n**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**\n> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**\n> and so on.\n\n**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**\n> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.\n\n**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**\n> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.\n\n**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**\n> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**\n> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.\n\n**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**\n> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.\n\n**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**\n> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.\n\n**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**\n> Michael.\n\n**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?\n\n**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**\n> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.\n\n**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this works in real life.\n\n**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**\n> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**\n> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.\n\n**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**\n> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.\n\n**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**\n> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**\n> It really doesn't take much.\n\n**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**\n> And so going to,\n\n**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**\n> beyond the single cell level.\n\n**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**\n> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.\n\n**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**\n> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.\n\n**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**\n> This is a cross-section through an adult human.\n\n**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**\n> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.\n\n**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where does this come from?\n\n**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**\n> How do these cells know to build all of this?\n\n**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.\n\n**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**\n> We have this genome.\n\n**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**\n> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.\n\n**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**\n> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.\n\n**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**\n> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.\n\n**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**\n> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.\n\n**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**\n> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.\n\n**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are the results of...\n\n**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**\n> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.\n\n**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now we need to know a few things.\n\n**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**\n> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know when to stop?\n\n**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**\n> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?\n\n**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**\n> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?\n\n**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**\n> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?\n\n**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**\n> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.\n\n**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**\n> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.\n\n**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?\n\n**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**\n> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.\n\n**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**\n> Now, the obvious biomedical.\n\n**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**\n> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.\n\n**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**\n> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.\n\n**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**\n> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.\n\n**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**\n> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.\n\n**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**\n> You're not going to try to micromanage this.\n\n**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**\n> This is a communications device.\n\n**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.\n\n**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**\n> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.\n\n**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**\n> What is it capable of doing?\n\n**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**\n> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.\n\n**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**\n> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.\n\n**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**\n> let's get it back.\n\n**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**\n> And why is that?\n\n**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.\n\n**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**\n> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**\n> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**\n> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.\n\n**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.\n\n**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**\n> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.\n\n**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**\n> But all of this has not yet been exploited.\n\n**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**\n> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.\n\n**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**\n> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> some sense.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**\n> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.\n\n**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**\n> So let's do a definition first.\n\n**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**\n> I like William James's definition of intelligence.\n\n**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.\n\n**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**\n> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.\n\n**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**\n> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.\n\n**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**\n> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.\n\n**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**\n> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the\n\n**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.\n\n**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**\n> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.\n\n**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**\n> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?\n\n**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.\n\n**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**\n> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.\n\n**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**\n> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.\n\n**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**\n> What we have here is something different, which is that\n\n**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.\n\n**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**\n> That's because the system can do something quite clever.\n\n**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**\n> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.\n\n**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.\n\n**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**\n> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.\n\n**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**\n> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.\n\n**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**\n> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.\n\n**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how these twins are naturally born.\n\n**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**\n> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.\n\n**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.\n\n**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**\n> And if you amputate anywhere along this.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> this limb.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.\n\n**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**\n> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?\n\n**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**\n> So at any position, you can do this.\n\n**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**\n> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.\n\n**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**\n> That's the most amazing part of all of this.\n\n**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**\n> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> When does it stop?\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.\n\n**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**\n> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**\n> You're here.\n\n**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**\n> It immediately recognizes the delta.\n\n**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**\n> It starts to reduce that error.\n\n**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**\n> So you've got an error minimization scheme.\n\n**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.\n\n**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**\n> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.\n\n**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how you recognize goals.\n\n**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**\n> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is\n\n**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**\n> its emergent complexity.\n\n**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**\n> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.\n\n**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**\n> That's not intelligence.\n\n**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**\n> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.\n\n**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**\n> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.\n\n**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**\n> And that's what happens here.\n\n**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**\n> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.\n\n**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**\n> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.\n\n**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**\n> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.\n\n**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**\n> Human livers are highly regenerative.\n\n**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**\n> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.\n\n**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**\n> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.\n\n**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**\n> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.\n\n**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**\n> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> things.\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.\n\n**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**\n> Here's where every cell goes.\n\n**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**\n> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.\n\n**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**\n> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?\n\n**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?\n\n**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**\n> I'll show you both of those things.\n\n**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**\n> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?\n\n**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**\n> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.\n\n**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**\n> are they cooperating?\n\n**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**\n> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.\n\n**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**\n> So just imagine you've got this rat.\n\n**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**\n> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.\n\n**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**\n> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.\n\n**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**\n> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.\n\n**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**\n> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.\n\n**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**\n> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.\n\n**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**\n> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that\n\n**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**\n> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.\n\n**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.\n\n**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**\n> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.\n\n**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?\n\n**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**\n> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?\n\n**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**\n> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.\n\n**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**\n> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.\n\n**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**\n> It's the electrical network.\n\n**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,\n\n**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**\n> is implemented by electrical networks.\n\n**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**\n> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.\n\n**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**\n> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.\n\n**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**\n> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.\n\n**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**\n> It's quite amazing.\n\n**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**\n> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.\n\n**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**\n> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.\n\n**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**\n> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.\n\n**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**\n> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.\n\n**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.\n\n**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**\n> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> it turns\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.\n\n**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**\n> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.\n\n**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**\n> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.\n\n**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**\n> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.\n\n**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**\n> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.\n\n**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**\n> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.\n\n**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**\n> What were these networks thinking about?\n\n**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**\n> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?\n\n**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**\n> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.\n\n**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**\n> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.\n\n**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**\n> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.\n\n**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not a simulation.\n\n**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**\n> This is real animal.\n\n**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**\n> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.\n\n**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.\n\n**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**\n> I want to show you what they look like.\n\n**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**\n> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**\n> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.\n\n**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**\n> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.\n\n**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**\n> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.\n\n**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.\n\n**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**\n> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.\n\n**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**\n> This is where the mouth is going to go.\n\n**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**\n> There's some other placode structures that come out here.\n\n**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.\n\n**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**\n> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.\n\n**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.\n\n**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**\n> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop\n\n**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**\n> on it and to try to decode it.\n\n**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**\n> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.\n\n**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.\n\n**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**\n> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.\n\n**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**\n> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.\n\n**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**\n> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.\n\n**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**\n> And we now have the tools.\n\n**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**\n> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.\n\n**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**\n> So now we can finally answer the question.\n\n**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.\n\n**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.\n\n**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**\n> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?\n\n**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**\n> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.\n\n**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**\n> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.\n\n**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**\n> So from this, we learn three things.\n\n**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.\n\n**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**\n> If you use those same\n\n**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**\n> signals elsewhere in the body.\n\n**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**\n> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.\n\n**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**\n> I could show you lots of other organs.\n\n**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**\n> Second, it's modular.\n\n**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.\n\n**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.\n\n**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**\n> We spoke to them at a very high level.\n\n**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**\n> We said, build an eye here.\n\n**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**\n> That is a very high level subroutine call.\n\n**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**\n> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.\n\n**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is not micromanagement.\n\n**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the genes.\n\n**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the cells.\n\n**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**\n> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.\n\n**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk later.\n\n**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**\n> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.\n\n**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk about how you might do that.\n\n**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...\n\n**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**\n> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.\n\n**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**\n> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?\n\n**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**\n> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.\n\n**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.\n\n**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**\n> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.\n\n**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**\n> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of\n\n**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**\n> participants and so on.\n\n**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**\n> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about\n\n**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**\n> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.\n\n**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**\n> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.\n\n**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**\n> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.\n\n**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**\n> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us\n\n**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**\n> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.\n\n**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**\n> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.\n\n**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.\n\n**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**\n> They are immortal.\n\n**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**\n> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.\n\n**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**\n> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.\n\n**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**\n> They've been around for 400 million years.\n\n**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**\n> These are them.\n\n**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**\n> They do not age and die.\n\n**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.\n\n**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**\n> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.\n\n**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's supposed to be the other way around.\n\n**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**\n> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.\n\n**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**\n> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.\n\n**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**\n> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.\n\n**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**\n> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**\n> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.\n\n**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**\n> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.\n\n**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**\n> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**\n> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.\n\n**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**\n> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.\n\n**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**\n> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.\n\n**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**\n> You can say, no, you should have two heads.\n\n**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**\n> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.\n\n**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.\n\n**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**\n> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.\n\n**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**\n> This is not AI or Photoshop.\n\n**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**\n> These are real animals.\n\n**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**\n> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.\n\n**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**\n> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.\n\n**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.\n\n**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**\n> Yep\n\n**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.\n\n**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> can do that.\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**\n> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.\n\n**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.\n\n**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.\n\n**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.\n\n**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is this is their only now.\n\n**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.\n\n**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**\n> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yep.\n\n**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**\n> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.\n\n**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**\n> Why?\n\n**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**\n> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could\n\n**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**\n> continuously cut them in plain water.\n\n**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**\n> No more manipulation of any kind.\n\n**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**\n> They remain two-headed.\n\n**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.\n\n**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**\n> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**\n> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**\n> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.\n\n**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**\n> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?\n\n**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**\n> And the genomes are exactly identical.\n\n**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing wrong with them.\n\n**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**\n> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?\n\n**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**\n> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.\n\n**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**\n> Not only can you, not only can you\n\n**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**\n> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.\n\n**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**\n> So these are derocephalus.\n\n**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**\n> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.\n\n**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**\n> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.\n\n**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**\n> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.\n\n**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**\n> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?\n\n**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**\n> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.\n\n**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**\n> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.\n\n**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**\n> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.\n\n**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**\n> You don't have to even be\n\n**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**\n> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.\n\n**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.\n\n**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**\n> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.\n\n**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**\n> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.\n\n**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**\n> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.\n\n**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**\n> We would have never known that.\n\n**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**\n> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.\n\n**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**\n> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.\n\n**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**\n> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.\n\n**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**\n> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.\n\n**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**\n> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?\n\n**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.\n\n**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**\n> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.\n\n**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**\n> So lots of evolution going on.\n\n**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**\n> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.\n\n**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**\n> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.\n\n**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**\n> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.\n\n**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**\n> They're put in a little depression.\n\n**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**\n> They could have done many things.\n\n**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**\n> They could have died.\n\n**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**\n> They could have spread away from each other.\n\n**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**\n> They could have formed a flat monolayer.\n\n**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**\n> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.\n\n**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**\n> We call it a xenobot.\n\n**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**\n> Xenobot because Xenopus later.\n\n**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**\n> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.\n\n**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**\n> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.\n\n**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**\n> So they're coordinated to swim.\n\n**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**\n> They can go in circles like this.\n\n**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**\n> They can go back and forth like this.\n\n**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**\n> And remember, this is just skin.\n\n**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**\n> There's no, these are epithelial cells.\n\n**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**\n> There is no neurons here.\n\n**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing else.\n\n**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have collective behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**\n> They can interact with each other.\n\n**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**\n> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.\n\n**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**\n> They can have individual behaviors and so on.\n\n**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.\n\n**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**\n> So it floats down here.\n\n**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**\n> It's swimming along.\n\n**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**\n> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.\n\n**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**\n> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff\n\n**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**\n> here are just the dissociated skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**\n> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.\n\n**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**\n> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.\n\n**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**\n> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?\n\n**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**\n> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.\n\n**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**\n> This is called kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**\n> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.\n\n**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is completely novel.\n\n**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**\n> We did not teach them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**\n> We did not have to force them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**\n> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.\n\n**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**\n> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**\n> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.\n\n**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?\n\n**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**\n> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.\n\n**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**\n> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.\n\n**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**\n> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.\n\n**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**\n> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**\n> They do have a developmental sequence.\n\n**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**\n> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.\n\n**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**\n> I have no idea.\n\n**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**\n> And they have these behaviors.\n\n**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**\n> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.\n\n**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.\n\n**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**\n> All of this emerges spontaneously.\n\n**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just complexity.\n\n**[01:03:46] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to put together a coherent organism with adaptive behaviors that functions in novel circumstances you've never seen before.\n\n**[01:04:00] Michael Levin**\n> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.\n\n**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.\n\n**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**\n> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.\n\n**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**\n> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings\n\n**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**\n> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.\n\n**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**\n> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.\n\n**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**\n> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.\n\n**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**\n> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.\n\n**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**\n> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for\n\n**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**\n> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.\n\n**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**\n> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.\n\n**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**\n> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.\n\n**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are possible.\n\n**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**\n> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.\n\n**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**\n> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.\n\n**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**\n> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.\n\n**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**\n> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.\n\n**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**\n> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.\n\n**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**\n> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.\n\n**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**\n> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**\n> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.\n\n**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**\n> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.\n\n**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**\n> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.\n\n**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**\n> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.\n\n**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**\n> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.\n\n**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**\n> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.\n\n**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**\n> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.\n\n**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**\n> I was looking for...\n\n**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**\n> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.\n\n**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**\n> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.\n\n**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**\n> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.\n\n**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**\n> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.\n\n**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**\n> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.\n\n**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**\n> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.\n\n**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...\n\n**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**\n> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.\n\n**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**\n> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.\n\n**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**\n> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.\n\n**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**\n> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.\n\n**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**\n> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.\n\n**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**\n> imagine something.\n\n**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**\n> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**\n> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**\n> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.\n\n**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**\n> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.\n\n**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**\n> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.\n\n**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**\n> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.\n\n**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**\n> It's like a plasmode.\n\n**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**\n> very rarefied plasma.\n\n**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**\n> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.\n\n**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**\n> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.\n\n**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**\n> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.\n\n**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**\n> And we don't even see it.\n\n**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of information.\n\n**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**\n> They're not real, like us.\n\n**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.\n\n**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**\n> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.\n\n**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**\n> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.\n\n**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**\n> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.\n\n**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**\n> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.\n\n**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**\n> And the others say, well, that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**\n> We're real organisms.\n\n**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**\n> We're solid.\n\n**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**\n> Patterns in gas can't be agents.\n\n**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**\n> What do you mean patterns?\n\n**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**\n> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?\n\n**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**\n> says, well, about 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**\n> But that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**\n> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**\n> That's too short.\n\n**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**\n> so what I think\n\n**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**\n> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.\n\n**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**\n> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.\n\n**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.\n\n**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**\n> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.\n\n**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.\n\n**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**\n> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.\n\n**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**\n> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.\n\n**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> these systems.\n\n**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**\n> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.\n\n**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**\n> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?\n\n**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**\n> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.\n\n**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**\n> So here's where I'll end.\n\n**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**\n> What I tried to tell you today is this.\n\n**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**\n> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.\n\n**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**\n> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.\n\n**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.\n\n**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**\n> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.\n\n**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**\n> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.\n\n**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**\n> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.\n\n**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**\n> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.\n\n**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.\n\n**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.\n\n**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.\n\n**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**\n> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.\n\n**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**\n> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.\n\n**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**\n> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.\n\n**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**\n> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.\n\n**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> These are two companies that support this work.\n\n**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**\n> So I thank you.\n\n**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Wow.\n\n**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could- Thank you.\n\n**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?\n\n**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**\n> I have a few minutes.\n\n**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.\n\n**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Really nice.\n\n**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm going to let other people go first.\n\n**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I'm loaded with questions.\n\n**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**\n> Alex.\n\n**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.\n\n**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**\n> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.\n\n**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**\n> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.\n\n**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**\n> So that's what takes me into biology.\n\n**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**\n> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.\n\n**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**\n> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.\n\n**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think that's exactly right.\n\n**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**\n> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.\n\n**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**\n> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.\n\n**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**\n> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.\n\n**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?\n\n**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**\n> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?\n\n**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**\n> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.\n\n**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**\n> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.\n\n**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**\n> But they can access these things.\n\n**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**\n> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.\n\n**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**\n> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?\n\n**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**\n> So last question, are we machines ourselves?\n\n**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**\n> Are we technologies of the natural world?\n\n**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**\n> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.\n\n**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**\n> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.\n\n**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is not what machines are.\n\n**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?\n\n**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**\n> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.\n\n**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**\n> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.\n\n**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**\n> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and\n\n**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.\n\n**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Both of those are true.\n\n**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob?\n\n**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**\n> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you, wonderful.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.\n\n**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**\n> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.\n\n**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?\n\n**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good question.\n\n**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**\n> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.\n\n**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.\n\n**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**\n> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.\n\n**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**\n> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.\n\n**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**\n> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.\n\n**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> like this.\n\n**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**\n> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.\n\n**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**\n> Let's take that last example.\n\n**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**\n> So they donate their lung and their trachea.\n\n**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**\n> We buy those cells from a company.\n\n**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**\n> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.\n\n**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**\n> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.\n\n**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**\n> They look kind of like xenobots.\n\n**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**\n> They have some different behaviors.\n\n**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> They have some amazing capabilities.\n\n**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**\n> They can heal neural wounds.\n\n**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**\n> do all kinds of wild stuff.\n\n**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**\n> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?\n\n**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**\n> So the original patient is perhaps dead.\n\n**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> Their cells are not dead.\n\n**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**\n> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.\n\n**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**\n> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?\n\n**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Where is this supposed to go?\n\n**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**\n> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,\n\n**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.\n\n**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**\n> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.\n\n**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**\n> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.\n\n**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**\n> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.\n\n**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**\n> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.\n\n**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**\n> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.\n\n**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**\n> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.\n\n**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> For example, we get tissue from smokers.\n\n**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**\n> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?\n\n**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**\n> You know, it's about a million questions.\n\n**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**\n> death is, yeah, I don't know.\n\n**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**\n> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.\n\n**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**\n> Wonderful, thank you.\n\n**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks.\n\n**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.\n\n**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**\n> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.\n\n**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And if so,\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?\n\n**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**\n> How are they being generated?\n\n**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, great question.\n\n**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**\n> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.\n\n**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**\n> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.\n\n**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**\n> OK, let's say they don't.\n\n**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**\n> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.\n\n**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**\n> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.\n\n**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**\n> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?\n\n**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.\n\n**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?\n\n**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.\n\n**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**\n> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?\n\n**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**\n> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.\n\n**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**\n> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.\n\n**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**\n> They get to the bottom.\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> What do they do?\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> make a beautiful bell curve, right?\n\n**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**\n> They make a Gaussian distribution.\n\n**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**\n> So now you can ask a simple question.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, that's a nice shape.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Where did that come from?\n\n**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**\n> So you're looking at the marbles.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the nails.\n\n**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the wood.\n\n**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**\n> Also not there.\n\n**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where did it come from, right?\n\n**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.\n\n**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**\n> Where is that?\n\n**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**\n> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.\n\n**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**\n> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**\n> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?\n\n**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.\n\n**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> And that's great.\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> Well, guess what?\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> You don't need to look for the third angle.\n\n**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**\n> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.\n\n**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**\n> So where is that?\n\n**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?\n\n**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some philosophical fluff.\n\n**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**\n> This is super practical.\n\n**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**\n> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.\n\n**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**\n> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.\n\n**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**\n> there are three things we need to track.\n\n**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.\n\n**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.\n\n**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not sure.\n\n**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.\n\n**[01:24:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They come from wherever the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My turn.\n\n**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.\n\n**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.\n\n**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.\n\n**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.\n\n**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.\n\n**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.\n\n**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.\n\n**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.\n\n**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> doesn't have to be.\n\n**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?\n\n**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**\n> Absolutely.\n\n**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.\n\n**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.\n\n**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**\n> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?\n\n**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**\n> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.\n\n**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**\n> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.\n\n**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**\n> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.\n\n**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.\n\n**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**\n> So, you know,\n\n**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.\n\n**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**\n> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.\n\n**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**\n> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.\n\n**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?\n\n**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?\n\n**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do anticipation?\n\n**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do generalization?\n\n**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do associative learning?\n\n**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**\n> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.\n\n**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> We could start with models.\n\n**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**\n> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.\n\n**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**\n> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.\n\n**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> And I think you can learn a lot from that.\n\n**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.\n\n**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**\n> Sure, cool.\n\n**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, thank you so much.\n\n**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.\n\n**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**\n> you.\n\n**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**\n> All right, bye bye.\n\n**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Deep breath.\n\n**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for hanging in.\n\n**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.\n\n**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.\n\n**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.\n\n**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing\n\n**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.\n\n**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The steering committee looked at his proposal.\n\n**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.\n\n**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's really making progress.\n\n**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.\n\n**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.\n\n**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He needs a mere another $4,500.\n\n**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can we help him go over the edge?\n\n**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.\n\n**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.\n\n**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.\n\n**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.\n\n**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The floor is yours.\n\n**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.\n\n**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.\n\n**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Thank you, John, and everyone.\n\n**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I think my network is okay.\n\n**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.\n\n**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I know we are all exhausted.\n\n**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to\n\n**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.\n\n**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.\n\n**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.\n\n**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a\n\n**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.\n\n**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.\n\n**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.\n\n**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.\n\n**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.\n\n**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.\n\n**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.\n\n**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Like currently, basically the characteristics.\n\n**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.\n\n**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.\n\n**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.\n\n**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so\n\n**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.\n\n**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.\n\n**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.\n\n**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.\n\n**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.\n\n**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.\n\n**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.\n\n**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.\n\n**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.\n\n**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.\n\n**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.\n\n**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is\n\n**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.\n\n**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.\n\n**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.\n\n**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.\n\n**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.\n\n**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.\n\n**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.\n\n**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> It can be\n\n**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.\n\n**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.\n\n**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.\n\n**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.\n\n**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.\n\n**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> culture, but you're doing other things.\n\n**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.\n\n**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.\n\n**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.\n\n**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.\n\n**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.\n\n**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar\n\n**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> the region.\n\n**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.\n\n**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.\n\n**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.\n\n**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.\n\n**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.\n\n**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> because the number of land to be exploited.\n\n**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.\n\n**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.\n\n**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.\n\n**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.\n\n**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.\n\n**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.\n\n**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's it.\n\n**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.\n\n**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.\n\n**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...\n\n**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.\n\n**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.\n\n**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after you command to national forest.\n\n**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> that's why my last slide.\n\n**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.\n\n**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Before, make sure our dream comes true.\n\n**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.\n\n**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.\n\n**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.\n\n**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.\n\n**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.\n\n**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.\n\n**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.\n\n**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.\n\n**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.\n\n**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.\n\n**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?\n\n**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?\n\n**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.\n\n**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.\n\n**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The cover trees and which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yes, as we're also making\n\n**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.\n\n**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.\n\n**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.\n\n**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.\n\n**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob.\n\n**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**\n> I thank you for great work.\n\n**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**\n> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.\n\n**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**\n> The 2nd 1.\n\n**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**\n> You can ask that straight away.\n\n**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will create.\n\n**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will.\n\n**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?\n\n**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.\n\n**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.\n\n**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's the short answer to your question.\n\n**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**\n> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.\n\n**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.\n\n**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**\n> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.\n\n**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**\n> I am certainly not an expert.\n\n**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**\n> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.\n\n**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**\n> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.\n\n**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that is something.\n\n**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a timely question.\n\n**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.\n\n**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.\n\n**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.\n\n**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.\n\n**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin.\n\n**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.\n\n**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**\n> That's very inspiring.\n\n**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.\n\n**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.\n\n**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.\n\n**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.\n\n**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**\n> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.\n\n**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**\n> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.\n\n**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.\n\n**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?\n\n**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What would a long-term region be for that?\n\n**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.\n\n**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.\n\n**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some\n\n**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.\n\n**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, so we will proceed with this.\n\n**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.\n\n**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.\n\n**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the work here?\n\n**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the actual planting?\n\n**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Do they get paid and so on?\n\n**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How does the labor component figure into this?\n\n**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're\n\n**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.\n\n**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.\n\n**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.\n\n**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?\n\n**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.\n\n**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.\n\n**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.\n\n**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> in our planning, we have\n\n**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.\n\n**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.\n\n**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.\n\n**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.\n\n**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.\n\n**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.\n\n**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.\n\n**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.\n\n**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.\n\n**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.\n\n**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.\n\n**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.\n\n**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.\n\n**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.\n\n**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.\n\n**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.\n\n**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.\n\n**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**\n> I just have a question.\n\n**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.\n\n**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**\n> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?\n\n**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**\n> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.\n\n**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,\n\n**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.\n\n**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.\n\n**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.\n\n**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.\n\n**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.\n\n**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.\n\n**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that would be one of the story.\n\n**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they\n\n**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.\n\n**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.\n\n**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.\n\n**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.\n\n**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, this is our website You\n\n**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.\n\n**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.\n\n**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the test.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If I search for Colombo, there he is.\n\n**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this is the information we have.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.\n\n**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.\n\n**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.\n\n**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.\n\n**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be basically a member space and a public space.\n\n**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.\n\n**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.\n\n**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.\n\n**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.\n\n**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also say that once we have a directory.\n\n**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're going to start encouraging members to become.\n\n**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.\n\n**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.\n\n**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.\n\n**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.\n\n**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.\n\n**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.\n\n**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's 10.56.\n\n**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I have no other items that I really want to get to.\n\n**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you everybody.\n\n**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks for being here.\n\n**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.\n\n**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.\n\n**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.\n\n**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki is also on the

(jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've been following you on social media.\n\n**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.\n\n**[00:09:28] Jon Schull**

theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.\n\n**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.\n\n**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.\n\n**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.\n\n**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.\n\n**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.\n\n**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.\n\n**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.\n\n**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.\n\n**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.\n\n**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.\n\n**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**\n> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.\n\n**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**\n> And then went on to do biology.\n\n**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**\n> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.\n\n**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.\n\n**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**\n> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.\n\n**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.\n\n**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.\n\n**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.\n\n**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**\n> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.\n\n**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.\n\n**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**\n> So living material is an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**\n> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.\n\n**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**\n> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.\n\n**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**\n> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.\n\n**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**\n> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.\n\n**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**\n> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.\n\n**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**\n> And specifically, want to emphasize\n\n**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.\n\n**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**\n> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.\n\n**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**\n> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.\n\n**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**\n> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.\n\n**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**\n> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.\n\n**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**\n> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.\n\n**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> And I will talk about that.\n\n**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.\n\n**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**\n> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.\n\n**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**\n> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.\n\n**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**\n> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.\n\n**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**\n> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.\n\n**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**\n> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.\n\n**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**\n> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.\n\n**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**\n> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**\n> I also think that this can.\n\n**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**\n> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.\n\n**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**\n> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.\n\n**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.\n\n**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**\n> It actually gets much weirder than that.\n\n**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**\n> So let's begin.\n\n**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.\n\n**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.\n\n**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**\n> So there are a couple of things going on here.\n\n**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**\n> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.\n\n**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**\n> we know where\n\n**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**\n> all the animals are here.\n\n**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**\n> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.\n\n**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**\n> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.\n\n**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**\n> We know where all the minds are here.\n\n**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**\n> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.\n\n**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**\n> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.\n\n**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**\n> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't God do it?\n\n**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?\n\n**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**\n> Why did Adam have to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**\n> I think there are two interesting things here.\n\n**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**\n> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.\n\n**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**\n> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.\n\n**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**\n> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.\n\n**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**\n> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have\n\n**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.\n\n**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**\n> so that part we should stick with.\n\n**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**\n> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.\n\n**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**\n> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.\n\n**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**\n> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.\n\n**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**\n> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.\n\n**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?\n\n**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?\n\n**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**\n> How far back here would you like to extend it?\n\n**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**\n> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.\n\n**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.\n\n**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**\n> How did you get from here to here.\n\n**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**\n> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.\n\n**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.\n\n**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.\n\n**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**\n> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.\n\n**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.\n\n**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**\n> And you will have other kinds of beings.\n\n**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**\n> So we'll get to that.\n\n**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm working on a framework.\n\n**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.\n\n**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.\n\n**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**\n> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.\n\n**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**\n> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.\n\n**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**\n> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**\n> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**\n> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.\n\n**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?\n\n**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.\n\n**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**\n> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.\n\n**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**\n> It has to be experimentally valuable.\n\n**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has to move discovery forward.\n\n**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.\n\n**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.\n\n**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...\n\n**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> or pleasant or whatever.\n\n**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**\n> It actually has very practical consequences.\n\n**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**\n> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.\n\n**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**\n> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.\n\n**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**\n> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.\n\n**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**\n> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.\n\n**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.\n\n**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> and are trainable by experiences.\n\n**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.\n\n**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.\n\n**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**\n> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?\n\n**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**\n> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.\n\n**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.\n\n**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**\n> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.\n\n**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**\n> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.\n\n**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**\n> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically\n\n**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.\n\n**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**\n> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.\n\n**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**\n> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.\n\n**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**\n> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.\n\n**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**\n> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> scaling?\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?\n\n**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**\n> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.\n\n**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**\n> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?\n\n**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**\n> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.\n\n**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**\n> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked\n\n**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems\n\n**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.\n\n**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**\n> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.\n\n**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**\n> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.\n\n**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.\n\n**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**\n> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.\n\n**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.\n\n**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**\n> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.\n\n**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> These kinds of systems navigate.\n\n**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**\n> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.\n\n**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**\n> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.\n\n**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**\n> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**\n> and so on.\n\n**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**\n> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.\n\n**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**\n> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.\n\n**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**\n> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**\n> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.\n\n**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**\n> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.\n\n**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**\n> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.\n\n**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**\n> Michael.\n\n**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?\n\n**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**\n> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.\n\n**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this works in real life.\n\n**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**\n> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**\n> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.\n\n**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**\n> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.\n\n**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**\n> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**\n> It really doesn't take much.\n\n**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**\n> And so going to,\n\n**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**\n> beyond the single cell level.\n\n**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**\n> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.\n\n**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**\n> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.\n\n**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**\n> This is a cross-section through an adult human.\n\n**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**\n> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.\n\n**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where does this come from?\n\n**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**\n> How do these cells know to build all of this?\n\n**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.\n\n**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**\n> We have this genome.\n\n**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**\n> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.\n\n**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**\n> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.\n\n**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**\n> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.\n\n**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**\n> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.\n\n**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**\n> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.\n\n**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are the results of...\n\n**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**\n> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.\n\n**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now we need to know a few things.\n\n**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**\n> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know when to stop?\n\n**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**\n> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?\n\n**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**\n> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?\n\n**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**\n> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?\n\n**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**\n> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.\n\n**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**\n> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.\n\n**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?\n\n**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**\n> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.\n\n**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**\n> Now, the obvious biomedical.\n\n**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**\n> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.\n\n**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**\n> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.\n\n**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**\n> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.\n\n**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**\n> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.\n\n**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**\n> You're not going to try to micromanage this.\n\n**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**\n> This is a communications device.\n\n**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.\n\n**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**\n> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.\n\n**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**\n> What is it capable of doing?\n\n**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**\n> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.\n\n**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**\n> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.\n\n**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**\n> let's get it back.\n\n**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**\n> And why is that?\n\n**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.\n\n**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**\n> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**\n> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**\n> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.\n\n**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.\n\n**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**\n> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.\n\n**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**\n> But all of this has not yet been exploited.\n\n**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**\n> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.\n\n**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**\n> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> some sense.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**\n> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.\n\n**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**\n> So let's do a definition first.\n\n**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**\n> I like William James's definition of intelligence.\n\n**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.\n\n**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**\n> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.\n\n**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**\n> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.\n\n**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**\n> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.\n\n**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**\n> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the\n\n**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.\n\n**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**\n> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.\n\n**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**\n> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?\n\n**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.\n\n**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**\n> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.\n\n**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**\n> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.\n\n**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**\n> What we have here is something different, which is that\n\n**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.\n\n**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**\n> That's because the system can do something quite clever.\n\n**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**\n> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.\n\n**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.\n\n**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**\n> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.\n\n**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**\n> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.\n\n**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**\n> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.\n\n**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how these twins are naturally born.\n\n**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**\n> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.\n\n**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.\n\n**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**\n> And if you amputate anywhere along this.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> this limb.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.\n\n**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**\n> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?\n\n**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**\n> So at any position, you can do this.\n\n**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**\n> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.\n\n**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**\n> That's the most amazing part of all of this.\n\n**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**\n> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> When does it stop?\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.\n\n**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**\n> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**\n> You're here.\n\n**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**\n> It immediately recognizes the delta.\n\n**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**\n> It starts to reduce that error.\n\n**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**\n> So you've got an error minimization scheme.\n\n**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.\n\n**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**\n> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.\n\n**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how you recognize goals.\n\n**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**\n> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is\n\n**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**\n> its emergent complexity.\n\n**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**\n> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.\n\n**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**\n> That's not intelligence.\n\n**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**\n> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.\n\n**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**\n> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.\n\n**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**\n> And that's what happens here.\n\n**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**\n> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.\n\n**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**\n> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.\n\n**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**\n> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.\n\n**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**\n> Human livers are highly regenerative.\n\n**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**\n> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.\n\n**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**\n> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.\n\n**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**\n> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.\n\n**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**\n> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> things.\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.\n\n**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**\n> Here's where every cell goes.\n\n**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**\n> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.\n\n**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**\n> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?\n\n**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?\n\n**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**\n> I'll show you both of those things.\n\n**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**\n> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?\n\n**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**\n> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.\n\n**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**\n> are they cooperating?\n\n**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**\n> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.\n\n**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**\n> So just imagine you've got this rat.\n\n**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**\n> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.\n\n**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**\n> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.\n\n**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**\n> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.\n\n**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**\n> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.\n\n**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**\n> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.\n\n**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**\n> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that\n\n**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**\n> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.\n\n**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.\n\n**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**\n> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.\n\n**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?\n\n**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**\n> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?\n\n**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**\n> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.\n\n**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**\n> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.\n\n**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**\n> It's the electrical network.\n\n**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,\n\n**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**\n> is implemented by electrical networks.\n\n**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**\n> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.\n\n**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**\n> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.\n\n**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**\n> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.\n\n**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**\n> It's quite amazing.\n\n**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**\n> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.\n\n**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**\n> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.\n\n**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**\n> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.\n\n**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**\n> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.\n\n**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.\n\n**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**\n> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> it turns\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.\n\n**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**\n> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.\n\n**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**\n> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.\n\n**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**\n> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.\n\n**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**\n> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.\n\n**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**\n> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.\n\n**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**\n> What were these networks thinking about?\n\n**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**\n> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?\n\n**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**\n> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.\n\n**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**\n> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.\n\n**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**\n> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.\n\n**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not a simulation.\n\n**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**\n> This is real animal.\n\n**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**\n> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.\n\n**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.\n\n**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**\n> I want to show you what they look like.\n\n**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**\n> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**\n> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.\n\n**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**\n> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.\n\n**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**\n> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.\n\n**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.\n\n**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**\n> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.\n\n**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**\n> This is where the mouth is going to go.\n\n**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**\n> There's some other placode structures that come out here.\n\n**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.\n\n**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**\n> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.\n\n**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.\n\n**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**\n> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop\n\n**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**\n> on it and to try to decode it.\n\n**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**\n> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.\n\n**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.\n\n**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**\n> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.\n\n**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**\n> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.\n\n**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**\n> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.\n\n**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**\n> And we now have the tools.\n\n**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**\n> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.\n\n**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**\n> So now we can finally answer the question.\n\n**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.\n\n**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.\n\n**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**\n> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?\n\n**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**\n> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.\n\n**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**\n> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.\n\n**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**\n> So from this, we learn three things.\n\n**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.\n\n**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**\n> If you use those same\n\n**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**\n> signals elsewhere in the body.\n\n**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**\n> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.\n\n**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**\n> I could show you lots of other organs.\n\n**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**\n> Second, it's modular.\n\n**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.\n\n**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.\n\n**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**\n> We spoke to them at a very high level.\n\n**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**\n> We said, build an eye here.\n\n**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**\n> That is a very high level subroutine call.\n\n**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**\n> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.\n\n**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is not micromanagement.\n\n**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the genes.\n\n**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the cells.\n\n**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**\n> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.\n\n**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk later.\n\n**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**\n> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.\n\n**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk about how you might do that.\n\n**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...\n\n**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**\n> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.\n\n**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**\n> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?\n\n**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**\n> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.\n\n**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.\n\n**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**\n> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.\n\n**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**\n> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of\n\n**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**\n> participants and so on.\n\n**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**\n> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about\n\n**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**\n> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.\n\n**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**\n> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.\n\n**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**\n> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.\n\n**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**\n> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us\n\n**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**\n> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.\n\n**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**\n> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.\n\n**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.\n\n**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**\n> They are immortal.\n\n**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**\n> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.\n\n**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**\n> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.\n\n**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**\n> They've been around for 400 million years.\n\n**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**\n> These are them.\n\n**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**\n> They do not age and die.\n\n**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.\n\n**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**\n> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.\n\n**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's supposed to be the other way around.\n\n**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**\n> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.\n\n**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**\n> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.\n\n**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**\n> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.\n\n**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**\n> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**\n> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.\n\n**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**\n> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.\n\n**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**\n> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**\n> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.\n\n**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**\n> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.\n\n**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**\n> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.\n\n**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**\n> You can say, no, you should have two heads.\n\n**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**\n> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.\n\n**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.\n\n**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**\n> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.\n\n**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**\n> This is not AI or Photoshop.\n\n**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**\n> These are real animals.\n\n**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**\n> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.\n\n**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**\n> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.\n\n**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.\n\n**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**\n> Yep\n\n**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.\n\n**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> can do that.\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**\n> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.\n\n**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.\n\n**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.\n\n**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.\n\n**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is this is their only now.\n\n**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.\n\n**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**\n> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yep.\n\n**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**\n> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.\n\n**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**\n> Why?\n\n**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**\n> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could\n\n**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**\n> continuously cut them in plain water.\n\n**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**\n> No more manipulation of any kind.\n\n**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**\n> They remain two-headed.\n\n**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.\n\n**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**\n> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**\n> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**\n> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.\n\n**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**\n> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?\n\n**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**\n> And the genomes are exactly identical.\n\n**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing wrong with them.\n\n**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**\n> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?\n\n**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**\n> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.\n\n**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**\n> Not only can you, not only can you\n\n**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**\n> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.\n\n**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**\n> So these are derocephalus.\n\n**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**\n> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.\n\n**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**\n> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.\n\n**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**\n> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.\n\n**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**\n> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?\n\n**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**\n> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.\n\n**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**\n> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.\n\n**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**\n> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.\n\n**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**\n> You don't have to even be\n\n**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**\n> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.\n\n**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.\n\n**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**\n> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.\n\n**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**\n> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.\n\n**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**\n> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.\n\n**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**\n> We would have never known that.\n\n**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**\n> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.\n\n**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**\n> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.\n\n**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**\n> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.\n\n**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**\n> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.\n\n**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**\n> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?\n\n**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.\n\n**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**\n> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.\n\n**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**\n> So lots of evolution going on.\n\n**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**\n> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.\n\n**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**\n> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.\n\n**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**\n> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.\n\n**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**\n> They're put in a little depression.\n\n**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**\n> They could have done many things.\n\n**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**\n> They could have died.\n\n**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**\n> They could have spread away from each other.\n\n**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**\n> They could have formed a flat monolayer.\n\n**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**\n> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.\n\n**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**\n> We call it a xenobot.\n\n**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**\n> Xenobot because Xenopus later.\n\n**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**\n> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.\n\n**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**\n> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.\n\n**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**\n> So they're coordinated to swim.\n\n**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**\n> They can go in circles like this.\n\n**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**\n> They can go back and forth like this.\n\n**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**\n> And remember, this is just skin.\n\n**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**\n> There's no, these are epithelial cells.\n\n**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**\n> There is no neurons here.\n\n**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing else.\n\n**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have collective behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**\n> They can interact with each other.\n\n**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**\n> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.\n\n**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**\n> They can have individual behaviors and so on.\n\n**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.\n\n**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**\n> So it floats down here.\n\n**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**\n> It's swimming along.\n\n**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**\n> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.\n\n**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**\n> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff\n\n**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**\n> here are just the dissociated skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**\n> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.\n\n**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**\n> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.\n\n**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**\n> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?\n\n**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**\n> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.\n\n**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**\n> This is called kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**\n> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.\n\n**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is completely novel.\n\n**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**\n> We did not teach them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**\n> We did not have to force them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**\n> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.\n\n**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**\n> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**\n> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.\n\n**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?\n\n**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**\n> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.\n\n**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**\n> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.\n\n**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**\n> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.\n\n**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**\n> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**\n> They do have a developmental sequence.\n\n**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**\n> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.\n\n**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**\n> I have no idea.\n\n**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**\n> And they have these behaviors.\n\n**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**\n> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.\n\n**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.\n\n**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**\n> All of this emerges spontaneously.\n\n**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just complexity.\n\n**[01:03:46] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to put together a coherent organism with adaptive behaviors that functions in novel circumstances you've never seen before.\n\n**[01:04:00] Michael Levin**\n> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.\n\n**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.\n\n**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**\n> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.\n\n**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**\n> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings\n\n**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**\n> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.\n\n**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**\n> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.\n\n**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**\n> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.\n\n**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**\n> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.\n\n**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**\n> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for\n\n**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**\n> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.\n\n**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**\n> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.\n\n**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**\n> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.\n\n**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are possible.\n\n**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**\n> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.\n\n**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**\n> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.\n\n**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**\n> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.\n\n**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**\n> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.\n\n**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**\n> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.\n\n**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**\n> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.\n\n**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**\n> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**\n> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.\n\n**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**\n> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.\n\n**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**\n> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.\n\n**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**\n> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.\n\n**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**\n> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.\n\n**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**\n> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.\n\n**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**\n> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.\n\n**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**\n> I was looking for...\n\n**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**\n> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.\n\n**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**\n> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.\n\n**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**\n> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.\n\n**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**\n> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.\n\n**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**\n> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.\n\n**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**\n> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.\n\n**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...\n\n**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**\n> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.\n\n**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**\n> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.\n\n**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**\n> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.\n\n**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**\n> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.\n\n**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**\n> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.\n\n**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**\n> imagine something.\n\n**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**\n> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**\n> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**\n> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.\n\n**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**\n> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.\n\n**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**\n> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.\n\n**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**\n> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.\n\n**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**\n> It's like a plasmode.\n\n**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**\n> very rarefied plasma.\n\n**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**\n> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.\n\n**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**\n> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.\n\n**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**\n> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.\n\n**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**\n> And we don't even see it.\n\n**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of information.\n\n**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**\n> They're not real, like us.\n\n**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.\n\n**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**\n> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.\n\n**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**\n> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.\n\n**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**\n> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.\n\n**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**\n> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.\n\n**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**\n> And the others say, well, that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**\n> We're real organisms.\n\n**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**\n> We're solid.\n\n**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**\n> Patterns in gas can't be agents.\n\n**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**\n> What do you mean patterns?\n\n**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**\n> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?\n\n**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**\n> says, well, about 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**\n> But that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**\n> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**\n> That's too short.\n\n**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**\n> so what I think\n\n**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**\n> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.\n\n**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**\n> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.\n\n**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.\n\n**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**\n> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.\n\n**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.\n\n**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**\n> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.\n\n**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**\n> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.\n\n**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> these systems.\n\n**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**\n> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.\n\n**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**\n> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?\n\n**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**\n> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.\n\n**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**\n> So here's where I'll end.\n\n**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**\n> What I tried to tell you today is this.\n\n**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**\n> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.\n\n**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**\n> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.\n\n**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.\n\n**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**\n> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.\n\n**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**\n> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.\n\n**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**\n> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.\n\n**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**\n> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.\n\n**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.\n\n**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.\n\n**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.\n\n**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**\n> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.\n\n**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**\n> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.\n\n**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**\n> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.\n\n**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**\n> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.\n\n**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> These are two companies that support this work.\n\n**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**\n> So I thank you.\n\n**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Wow.\n\n**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could- Thank you.\n\n**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?\n\n**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**\n> I have a few minutes.\n\n**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.\n\n**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Really nice.\n\n**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm going to let other people go first.\n\n**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I'm loaded with questions.\n\n**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**\n> Alex.\n\n**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.\n\n**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**\n> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.\n\n**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**\n> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.\n\n**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**\n> So that's what takes me into biology.\n\n**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**\n> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.\n\n**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**\n> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.\n\n**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think that's exactly right.\n\n**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**\n> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.\n\n**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**\n> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.\n\n**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**\n> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.\n\n**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?\n\n**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**\n> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?\n\n**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**\n> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.\n\n**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**\n> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.\n\n**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**\n> But they can access these things.\n\n**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**\n> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.\n\n**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**\n> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?\n\n**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**\n> So last question, are we machines ourselves?\n\n**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**\n> Are we technologies of the natural world?\n\n**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**\n> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.\n\n**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**\n> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.\n\n**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is not what machines are.\n\n**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?\n\n**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**\n> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.\n\n**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**\n> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.\n\n**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**\n> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and\n\n**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.\n\n**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Both of those are true.\n\n**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob?\n\n**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**\n> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you, wonderful.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.\n\n**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**\n> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.\n\n**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?\n\n**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good question.\n\n**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**\n> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.\n\n**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.\n\n**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**\n> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.\n\n**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**\n> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.\n\n**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**\n> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.\n\n**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> like this.\n\n**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**\n> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.\n\n**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**\n> Let's take that last example.\n\n**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**\n> So they donate their lung and their trachea.\n\n**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**\n> We buy those cells from a company.\n\n**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**\n> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.\n\n**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**\n> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.\n\n**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**\n> They look kind of like xenobots.\n\n**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**\n> They have some different behaviors.\n\n**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> They have some amazing capabilities.\n\n**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**\n> They can heal neural wounds.\n\n**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**\n> do all kinds of wild stuff.\n\n**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**\n> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?\n\n**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**\n> So the original patient is perhaps dead.\n\n**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> Their cells are not dead.\n\n**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**\n> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.\n\n**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**\n> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?\n\n**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Where is this supposed to go?\n\n**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**\n> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,\n\n**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.\n\n**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**\n> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.\n\n**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**\n> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.\n\n**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**\n> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.\n\n**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**\n> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.\n\n**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**\n> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.\n\n**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**\n> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.\n\n**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> For example, we get tissue from smokers.\n\n**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**\n> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?\n\n**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**\n> You know, it's about a million questions.\n\n**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**\n> death is, yeah, I don't know.\n\n**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**\n> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.\n\n**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**\n> Wonderful, thank you.\n\n**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks.\n\n**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.\n\n**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**\n> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.\n\n**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And if so,\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?\n\n**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**\n> How are they being generated?\n\n**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, great question.\n\n**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**\n> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.\n\n**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**\n> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.\n\n**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**\n> OK, let's say they don't.\n\n**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**\n> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.\n\n**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**\n> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.\n\n**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**\n> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?\n\n**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.\n\n**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?\n\n**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.\n\n**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**\n> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?\n\n**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**\n> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.\n\n**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**\n> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.\n\n**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**\n> They get to the bottom.\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> What do they do?\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> make a beautiful bell curve, right?\n\n**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**\n> They make a Gaussian distribution.\n\n**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**\n> So now you can ask a simple question.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, that's a nice shape.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Where did that come from?\n\n**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**\n> So you're looking at the marbles.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the nails.\n\n**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the wood.\n\n**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**\n> Also not there.\n\n**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where did it come from, right?\n\n**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.\n\n**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**\n> Where is that?\n\n**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**\n> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.\n\n**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**\n> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**\n> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?\n\n**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.\n\n**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> And that's great.\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> Well, guess what?\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> You don't need to look for the third angle.\n\n**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**\n> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.\n\n**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**\n> So where is that?\n\n**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?\n\n**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some philosophical fluff.\n\n**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**\n> This is super practical.\n\n**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**\n> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.\n\n**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**\n> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.\n\n**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**\n> there are three things we need to track.\n\n**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.\n\n**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.\n\n**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not sure.\n\n**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.\n\n**[01:24:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They come from wherever the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My turn.\n\n**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.\n\n**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.\n\n**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.\n\n**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.\n\n**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.\n\n**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.\n\n**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.\n\n**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.\n\n**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> doesn't have to be.\n\n**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?\n\n**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**\n> Absolutely.\n\n**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.\n\n**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.\n\n**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**\n> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?\n\n**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**\n> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.\n\n**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**\n> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.\n\n**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**\n> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.\n\n**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.\n\n**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**\n> So, you know,\n\n**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.\n\n**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**\n> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.\n\n**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**\n> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.\n\n**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?\n\n**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?\n\n**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do anticipation?\n\n**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do generalization?\n\n**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do associative learning?\n\n**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**\n> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.\n\n**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> We could start with models.\n\n**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**\n> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.\n\n**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**\n> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.\n\n**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> And I think you can learn a lot from that.\n\n**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.\n\n**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**\n> Sure, cool.\n\n**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, thank you so much.\n\n**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.\n\n**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**\n> you.\n\n**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**\n> All right, bye bye.\n\n**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Deep breath.\n\n**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for hanging in.\n\n**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.\n\n**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.\n\n**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.\n\n**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing\n\n**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.\n\n**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The steering committee looked at his proposal.\n\n**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.\n\n**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's really making progress.\n\n**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.\n\n**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.\n\n**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He needs a mere another $4,500.\n\n**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can we help him go over the edge?\n\n**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.\n\n**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.\n\n**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.\n\n**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.\n\n**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The floor is yours.\n\n**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.\n\n**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.\n\n**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Thank you, John, and everyone.\n\n**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I think my network is okay.\n\n**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.\n\n**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I know we are all exhausted.\n\n**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to\n\n**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.\n\n**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.\n\n**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.\n\n**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a\n\n**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.\n\n**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.\n\n**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.\n\n**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.\n\n**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.\n\n**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.\n\n**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.\n\n**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Like currently, basically the characteristics.\n\n**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.\n\n**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.\n\n**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.\n\n**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so\n\n**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.\n\n**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.\n\n**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.\n\n**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.\n\n**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.\n\n**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.\n\n**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.\n\n**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.\n\n**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.\n\n**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.\n\n**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.\n\n**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is\n\n**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.\n\n**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.\n\n**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.\n\n**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.\n\n**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.\n\n**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.\n\n**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.\n\n**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> It can be\n\n**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.\n\n**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.\n\n**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.\n\n**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.\n\n**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.\n\n**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> culture, but you're doing other things.\n\n**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.\n\n**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.\n\n**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.\n\n**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.\n\n**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.\n\n**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar\n\n**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> the region.\n\n**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.\n\n**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.\n\n**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.\n\n**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.\n\n**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.\n\n**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> because the number of land to be exploited.\n\n**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.\n\n**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.\n\n**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.\n\n**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.\n\n**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.\n\n**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.\n\n**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's it.\n\n**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.\n\n**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.\n\n**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...\n\n**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.\n\n**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.\n\n**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after you command to national forest.\n\n**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> that's why my last slide.\n\n**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.\n\n**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Before, make sure our dream comes true.\n\n**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.\n\n**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.\n\n**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.\n\n**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.\n\n**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.\n\n**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.\n\n**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.\n\n**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.\n\n**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.\n\n**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.\n\n**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?\n\n**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?\n\n**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.\n\n**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.\n\n**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The cover trees and which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yes, as we're also making\n\n**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.\n\n**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.\n\n**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.\n\n**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.\n\n**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob.\n\n**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**\n> I thank you for great work.\n\n**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**\n> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.\n\n**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**\n> The 2nd 1.\n\n**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**\n> You can ask that straight away.\n\n**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will create.\n\n**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will.\n\n**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?\n\n**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.\n\n**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.\n\n**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's the short answer to your question.\n\n**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**\n> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.\n\n**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.\n\n**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**\n> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.\n\n**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**\n> I am certainly not an expert.\n\n**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**\n> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.\n\n**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**\n> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.\n\n**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that is something.\n\n**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a timely question.\n\n**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.\n\n**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.\n\n**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.\n\n**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.\n\n**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin.\n\n**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.\n\n**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**\n> That's very inspiring.\n\n**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.\n\n**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.\n\n**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.\n\n**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.\n\n**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**\n> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.\n\n**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**\n> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.\n\n**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.\n\n**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?\n\n**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What would a long-term region be for that?\n\n**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.\n\n**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.\n\n**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some\n\n**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.\n\n**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, so we will proceed with this.\n\n**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.\n\n**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.\n\n**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the work here?\n\n**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the actual planting?\n\n**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Do they get paid and so on?\n\n**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How does the labor component figure into this?\n\n**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're\n\n**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.\n\n**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.\n\n**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.\n\n**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?\n\n**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.\n\n**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.\n\n**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.\n\n**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> in our planning, we have\n\n**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.\n\n**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.\n\n**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.\n\n**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.\n\n**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.\n\n**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.\n\n**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.\n\n**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.\n\n**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.\n\n**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.\n\n**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.\n\n**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.\n\n**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.\n\n**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.\n\n**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.\n\n**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.\n\n**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.\n\n**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**\n> I just have a question.\n\n**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.\n\n**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**\n> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?\n\n**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**\n> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.\n\n**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,\n\n**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.\n\n**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.\n\n**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.\n\n**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.\n\n**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.\n\n**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.\n\n**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that would be one of the story.\n\n**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they\n\n**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.\n\n**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.\n\n**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.\n\n**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.\n\n**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, this is our website You\n\n**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.\n\n**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.\n\n**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the test.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If I search for Colombo, there he is.\n\n**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this is the information we have.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.\n\n**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.\n\n**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.\n\n**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.\n\n**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be basically a member space and a public space.\n\n**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.\n\n**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.\n\n**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.\n\n**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.\n\n**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also say that once we have a directory.\n\n**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're going to start encouraging members to become.\n\n**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.\n\n**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.\n\n**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.\n\n**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.\n\n**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.\n\n**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.\n\n**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's 10.56.\n\n**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I have no other items that I really want to get to.\n\n**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you everybody.\n\n**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks for being here.\n\n**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n---\n---\n---",

pronounces his name, Rob the left, but what does he know.\n\n**[00:07:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Is where you.\n\n**[00:08:01] Rob De Laet**\n> I'm in Amsterdam.\n\n**[00:08:03] Rob De Laet**\n> Hello everybody.\n\n**[00:08:05] Rob De Laet**\n> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.\n\n**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.\n\n**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.\n\n**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.\n\n**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, hello, Kwaki.\n\n**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning.\n\n**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning, everybody.\n\n**[00:09:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Pierre, associated with Alex by this is my memory test, my mental status exam.\n\n**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.\n\n**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've been following you on social media.\n\n**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.\n\n**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.\n\n**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Ali bin Shahid.\n\n**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think is also on the Bezos grant.\n\n**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.\n\n**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.\n\n**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.\n\n**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.\n\n**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.\n\n**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.\n\n**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.\n\n**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.\n\n**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.\n\n**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.\n\n**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.\n\n**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**\n> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.\n\n**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**\n> And then went on to do biology.\n\n**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**\n> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.\n\n**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.\n\n**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**\n> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.\n\n**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.\n\n**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.\n\n**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.\n\n**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**\n> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.\n\n**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.\n\n**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**\n> So living material is an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**\n> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.\n\n**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**\n> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.\n\n**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**\n> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.\n\n**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**\n> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.\n\n**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**\n> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.\n\n**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**\n> And specifically, want to emphasize\n\n**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.\n\n**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**\n> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.\n\n**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**\n> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.\n\n**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**\n> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.\n\n**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**\n> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.\n\n**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**\n> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.\n\n**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> And I will talk about that.\n\n**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.\n\n**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**\n> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.\n\n**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**\n> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.\n\n**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**\n> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.\n\n**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**\n> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.\n\n**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**\n> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.\n\n**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**\n> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.\n\n**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**\n> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**\n> I also think that this can.\n\n**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**\n> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.\n\n**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**\n> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.\n\n**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.\n\n**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**\n> It actually gets much weirder than that.\n\n**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**\n> So let's begin.\n\n**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.\n\n**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.\n\n**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**\n> So there are a couple of things going on here.\n\n**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**\n> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.\n\n**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**\n> we know where\n\n**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**\n> all the animals are here.\n\n**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**\n> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.\n\n**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**\n> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.\n\n**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**\n> We know where all the minds are here.\n\n**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**\n> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.\n\n**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**\n> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.\n\n**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**\n> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't God do it?\n\n**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?\n\n**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**\n> Why did Adam have to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**\n> I think there are two interesting things here.\n\n**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**\n> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.\n\n**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**\n> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.\n\n**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**\n> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.\n\n**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**\n> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have\n\n**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.\n\n**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**\n> so that part we should stick with.\n\n**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**\n> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.\n\n**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**\n> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.\n\n**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**\n> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.\n\n**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**\n> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.\n\n**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?\n\n**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?\n\n**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**\n> How far back here would you like to extend it?\n\n**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**\n> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.\n\n**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.\n\n**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**\n> How did you get from here to here.\n\n**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**\n> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.\n\n**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.\n\n**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.\n\n**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**\n> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.\n\n**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.\n\n**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**\n> And you will have other kinds of beings.\n\n**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**\n> So we'll get to that.\n\n**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm working on a framework.\n\n**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.\n\n**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.\n\n**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**\n> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.\n\n**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**\n> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.\n\n**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**\n> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**\n> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**\n> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.\n\n**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?\n\n**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.\n\n**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**\n> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.\n\n**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**\n> It has to be experimentally valuable.\n\n**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has to move discovery forward.\n\n**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.\n\n**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.\n\n**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...\n\n**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> or pleasant or whatever.\n\n**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**\n> It actually has very practical consequences.\n\n**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**\n> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.\n\n**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**\n> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.\n\n**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**\n> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.\n\n**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**\n> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.\n\n**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.\n\n**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> and are trainable by experiences.\n\n**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.\n\n**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.\n\n**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**\n> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?\n\n**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**\n> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.\n\n**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.\n\n**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**\n> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.\n\n**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**\n> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.\n\n**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**\n> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically\n\n**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.\n\n**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**\n> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.\n\n**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**\n> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.\n\n**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**\n> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.\n\n**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**\n> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> scaling?\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?\n\n**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**\n> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.\n\n**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**\n> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?\n\n**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**\n> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.\n\n**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**\n> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked\n\n**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems\n\n**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.\n\n**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**\n> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.\n\n**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**\n> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.\n\n**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.\n\n**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**\n> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.\n\n**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.\n\n**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**\n> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.\n\n**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> These kinds of systems navigate.\n\n**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**\n> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.\n\n**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**\n> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.\n\n**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**\n> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**\n> and so on.\n\n**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**\n> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.\n\n**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**\n> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.\n\n**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**\n> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**\n> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.\n\n**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**\n> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.\n\n**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**\n> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.\n\n**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**\n> Michael.\n\n**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?\n\n**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**\n> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.\n\n**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this works in real life.\n\n**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**\n> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**\n> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.\n\n**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**\n> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.\n\n**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**\n> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**\n> It really doesn't take much.\n\n**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**\n> And so going to,\n\n**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**\n> beyond the single cell level.\n\n**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**\n> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.\n\n**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**\n> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.\n\n**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**\n> This is a cross-section through an adult human.\n\n**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**\n> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.\n\n**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where does this come from?\n\n**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**\n> How do these cells know to build all of this?\n\n**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.\n\n**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**\n> We have this genome.\n\n**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**\n> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.\n\n**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**\n> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.\n\n**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**\n> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.\n\n**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**\n> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.\n\n**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**\n> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.\n\n**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are the results of...\n\n**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**\n> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.\n\n**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now we need to know a few things.\n\n**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**\n> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know when to stop?\n\n**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**\n> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?\n\n**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**\n> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?\n\n**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**\n> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?\n\n**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**\n> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.\n\n**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**\n> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.\n\n**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?\n\n**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**\n> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.\n\n**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**\n> Now, the obvious biomedical.\n\n**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**\n> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.\n\n**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**\n> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.\n\n**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**\n> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.\n\n**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**\n> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.\n\n**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**\n> You're not going to try to micromanage this.\n\n**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**\n> This is a communications device.\n\n**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.\n\n**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**\n> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.\n\n**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**\n> What is it capable of doing?\n\n**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**\n> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.\n\n**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**\n> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.\n\n**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**\n> let's get it back.\n\n**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**\n> And why is that?\n\n**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.\n\n**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**\n> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**\n> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**\n> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.\n\n**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.\n\n**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**\n> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.\n\n**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**\n> But all of this has not yet been exploited.\n\n**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**\n> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.\n\n**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**\n> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> some sense.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**\n> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.\n\n**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**\n> So let's do a definition first.\n\n**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**\n> I like William James's definition of intelligence.\n\n**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.\n\n**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**\n> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.\n\n**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**\n> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.\n\n**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**\n> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.\n\n**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**\n> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the\n\n**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.\n\n**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**\n> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.\n\n**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**\n> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?\n\n**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.\n\n**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**\n> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.\n\n**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**\n> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.\n\n**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**\n> What we have here is something different, which is that\n\n**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.\n\n**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**\n> That's because the system can do something quite clever.\n\n**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**\n> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.\n\n**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.\n\n**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**\n> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.\n\n**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**\n> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.\n\n**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**\n> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.\n\n**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how these twins are naturally born.\n\n**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**\n> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.\n\n**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.\n\n**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**\n> And if you amputate anywhere along this.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> this limb.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.\n\n**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**\n> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?\n\n**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**\n> So at any position, you can do this.\n\n**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**\n> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.\n\n**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**\n> That's the most amazing part of all of this.\n\n**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**\n> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> When does it stop?\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.\n\n**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**\n> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**\n> You're here.\n\n**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**\n> It immediately recognizes the delta.\n\n**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**\n> It starts to reduce that error.\n\n**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**\n> So you've got an error minimization scheme.\n\n**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.\n\n**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**\n> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.\n\n**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how you recognize goals.\n\n**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**\n> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is\n\n**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**\n> its emergent complexity.\n\n**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**\n> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.\n\n**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**\n> That's not intelligence.\n\n**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**\n> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.\n\n**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**\n> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.\n\n**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**\n> And that's what happens here.\n\n**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**\n> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.\n\n**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**\n> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.\n\n**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**\n> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.\n\n**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**\n> Human livers are highly regenerative.\n\n**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**\n> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.\n\n**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**\n> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.\n\n**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**\n> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.\n\n**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**\n> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> things.\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.\n\n**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**\n> Here's where every cell goes.\n\n**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**\n> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.\n\n**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**\n> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?\n\n**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?\n\n**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**\n> I'll show you both of those things.\n\n**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**\n> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?\n\n**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**\n> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.\n\n**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**\n> are they cooperating?\n\n**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**\n> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.\n\n**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**\n> So just imagine you've got this rat.\n\n**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**\n> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.\n\n**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**\n> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.\n\n**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**\n> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.\n\n**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**\n> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.\n\n**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**\n> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.\n\n**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**\n> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that\n\n**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**\n> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.\n\n**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.\n\n**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**\n> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.\n\n**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?\n\n**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**\n> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?\n\n**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**\n> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.\n\n**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**\n> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.\n\n**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**\n> It's the electrical network.\n\n**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,\n\n**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**\n> is implemented by electrical networks.\n\n**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**\n> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.\n\n**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**\n> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.\n\n**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**\n> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.\n\n**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**\n> It's quite amazing.\n\n**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**\n> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.\n\n**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**\n> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.\n\n**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**\n> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.\n\n**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**\n> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.\n\n**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.\n\n**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**\n> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> it turns\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.\n\n**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**\n> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.\n\n**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**\n> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.\n\n**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**\n> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.\n\n**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**\n> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.\n\n**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**\n> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.\n\n**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**\n> What were these networks thinking about?\n\n**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**\n> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?\n\n**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**\n> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.\n\n**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**\n> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.\n\n**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**\n> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.\n\n**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not a simulation.\n\n**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**\n> This is real animal.\n\n**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**\n> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.\n\n**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.\n\n**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**\n> I want to show you what they look like.\n\n**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**\n> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**\n> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.\n\n**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**\n> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.\n\n**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**\n> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.\n\n**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.\n\n**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**\n> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.\n\n**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**\n> This is where the mouth is going to go.\n\n**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**\n> There's some other placode structures that come out here.\n\n**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.\n\n**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**\n> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.\n\n**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.\n\n**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**\n> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop\n\n**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**\n> on it and to try to decode it.\n\n**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**\n> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.\n\n**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.\n\n**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**\n> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.\n\n**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**\n> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.\n\n**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**\n> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.\n\n**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**\n> And we now have the tools.\n\n**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**\n> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.\n\n**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**\n> So now we can finally answer the question.\n\n**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.\n\n**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.\n\n**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**\n> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?\n\n**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**\n> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.\n\n**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**\n> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.\n\n**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**\n> So from this, we learn three things.\n\n**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.\n\n**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**\n> If you use those same\n\n**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**\n> signals elsewhere in the body.\n\n**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**\n> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.\n\n**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**\n> I could show you lots of other organs.\n\n**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**\n> Second, it's modular.\n\n**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.\n\n**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.\n\n**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**\n> We spoke to them at a very high level.\n\n**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**\n> We said, build an eye here.\n\n**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**\n> That is a very high level subroutine call.\n\n**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**\n> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.\n\n**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is not micromanagement.\n\n**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the genes.\n\n**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the cells.\n\n**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**\n> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.\n\n**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk later.\n\n**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**\n> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.\n\n**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk about how you might do that.\n\n**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...\n\n**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**\n> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.\n\n**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**\n> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?\n\n**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**\n> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.\n\n**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.\n\n**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**\n> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.\n\n**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**\n> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of\n\n**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**\n> participants and so on.\n\n**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**\n> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about\n\n**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**\n> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.\n\n**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**\n> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.\n\n**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**\n> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.\n\n**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**\n> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us\n\n**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**\n> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.\n\n**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**\n> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.\n\n**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.\n\n**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**\n> They are immortal.\n\n**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**\n> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.\n\n**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**\n> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.\n\n**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**\n> They've been around for 400 million years.\n\n**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**\n> These are them.\n\n**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**\n> They do not age and die.\n\n**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.\n\n**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**\n> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.\n\n**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's supposed to be the other way around.\n\n**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**\n> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.\n\n**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**\n> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.\n\n**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**\n> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.\n\n**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**\n> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**\n> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.\n\n**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**\n> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.\n\n**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**\n> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**\n> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.\n\n**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**\n> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.\n\n**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**\n> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.\n\n**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**\n> You can say, no, you should have two heads.\n\n**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**\n> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.\n\n**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.\n\n**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**\n> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.\n\n**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**\n> This is not AI or Photoshop.\n\n**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**\n> These are real animals.\n\n**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**\n> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.\n\n**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**\n> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.\n\n**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.\n\n**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**\n> Yep\n\n**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.\n\n**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> can do that.\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**\n> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.\n\n**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.\n\n**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.\n\n**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.\n\n**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is this is their only now.\n\n**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.\n\n**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**\n> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yep.\n\n**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**\n> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.\n\n**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**\n> Why?\n\n**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**\n> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could\n\n**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**\n> continuously cut them in plain water.\n\n**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**\n> No more manipulation of any kind.\n\n**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**\n> They remain two-headed.\n\n**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.\n\n**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**\n> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**\n> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**\n> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.\n\n**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**\n> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?\n\n**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**\n> And the genomes are exactly identical.\n\n**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing wrong with them.\n\n**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**\n> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?\n\n**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**\n> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.\n\n**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**\n> Not only can you, not only can you\n\n**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**\n> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.\n\n**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**\n> So these are derocephalus.\n\n**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**\n> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.\n\n**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**\n> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.\n\n**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**\n> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.\n\n**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**\n> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?\n\n**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**\n> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.\n\n**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**\n> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.\n\n**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**\n> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.\n\n**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**\n> You don't have to even be\n\n**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**\n> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.\n\n**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.\n\n**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**\n> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.\n\n**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**\n> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.\n\n**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**\n> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.\n\n**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**\n> We would have never known that.\n\n**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**\n> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.\n\n**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**\n> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.\n\n**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**\n> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.\n\n**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**\n> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.\n\n**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**\n> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?\n\n**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.\n\n**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**\n> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.\n\n**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**\n> So lots of evolution going on.\n\n**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**\n> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.\n\n**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**\n> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.\n\n**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**\n> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.\n\n**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**\n> They're put in a little depression.\n\n**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**\n> They could have done many things.\n\n**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**\n> They could have died.\n\n**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**\n> They could have spread away from each other.\n\n**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**\n> They could have formed a flat monolayer.\n\n**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**\n> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.\n\n**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**\n> We call it a xenobot.\n\n**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**\n> Xenobot because Xenopus later.\n\n**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**\n> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.\n\n**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**\n> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.\n\n**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**\n> So they're coordinated to swim.\n\n**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**\n> They can go in circles like this.\n\n**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**\n> They can go back and forth like this.\n\n**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**\n> And remember, this is just skin.\n\n**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**\n> There's no, these are epithelial cells.\n\n**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**\n> There is no neurons here.\n\n**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing else.\n\n**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have collective behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**\n> They can interact with each other.\n\n**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**\n> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.\n\n**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**\n> They can have individual behaviors and so on.\n\n**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.\n\n**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**\n> So it floats down here.\n\n**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**\n> It's swimming along.\n\n**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**\n> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.\n\n**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**\n> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff\n\n**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**\n> here are just the dissociated skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**\n> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.\n\n**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**\n> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.\n\n**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**\n> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?\n\n**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**\n> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.\n\n**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**\n> This is called kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**\n> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.\n\n**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is completely novel.\n\n**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**\n> We did not teach them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**\n> We did not have to force them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**\n> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.\n\n**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**\n> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**\n> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.\n\n**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?\n\n**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**\n> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.\n\n**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**\n> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.\n\n**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**\n> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.\n\n**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**\n> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**\n> They do have a developmental sequence.\n\n**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**\n> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.\n\n**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**\n> I have no idea.\n\n**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**\n> And they have these behaviors.\n\n**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**\n> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.\n\n**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.\n\n**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**\n> All of this emerges spontaneously.\n\n**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just complexity.\n\n**[01:03:46] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to put together a coherent organism with adaptive behaviors that functions in novel circumstances you've never seen before.\n\n**[01:04:00] Michael Levin**\n> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.\n\n**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.\n\n**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**\n> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.\n\n**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**\n> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings\n\n**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**\n> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.\n\n**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**\n> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.\n\n**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**\n> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.\n\n**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**\n> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.\n\n**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**\n> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for\n\n**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**\n> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.\n\n**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**\n> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.\n\n**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**\n> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.\n\n**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are possible.\n\n**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**\n> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.\n\n**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**\n> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.\n\n**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**\n> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.\n\n**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**\n> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.\n\n**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**\n> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.\n\n**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**\n> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.\n\n**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**\n> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**\n> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.\n\n**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**\n> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.\n\n**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**\n> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.\n\n**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**\n> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.\n\n**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**\n> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.\n\n**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**\n> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.\n\n**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**\n> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.\n\n**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**\n> I was looking for...\n\n**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**\n> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.\n\n**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**\n> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.\n\n**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**\n> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.\n\n**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**\n> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.\n\n**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**\n> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.\n\n**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**\n> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.\n\n**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...\n\n**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**\n> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.\n\n**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**\n> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.\n\n**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**\n> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.\n\n**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**\n> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.\n\n**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**\n> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.\n\n**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**\n> imagine something.\n\n**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**\n> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**\n> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**\n> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.\n\n**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**\n> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.\n\n**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**\n> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.\n\n**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**\n> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.\n\n**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**\n> It's like a plasmode.\n\n**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**\n> very rarefied plasma.\n\n**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**\n> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.\n\n**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**\n> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.\n\n**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**\n> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.\n\n**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**\n> And we don't even see it.\n\n**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of information.\n\n**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**\n> They're not real, like us.\n\n**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.\n\n**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**\n> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.\n\n**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**\n> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.\n\n**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**\n> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.\n\n**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**\n> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.\n\n**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**\n> And the others say, well, that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**\n> We're real organisms.\n\n**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**\n> We're solid.\n\n**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**\n> Patterns in gas can't be agents.\n\n**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**\n> What do you mean patterns?\n\n**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**\n> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?\n\n**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**\n> says, well, about 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**\n> But that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**\n> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**\n> That's too short.\n\n**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**\n> so what I think\n\n**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**\n> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.\n\n**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**\n> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.\n\n**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.\n\n**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**\n> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.\n\n**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.\n\n**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**\n> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.\n\n**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**\n> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.\n\n**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> these systems.\n\n**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**\n> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.\n\n**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**\n> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?\n\n**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**\n> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.\n\n**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**\n> So here's where I'll end.\n\n**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**\n> What I tried to tell you today is this.\n\n**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**\n> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.\n\n**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**\n> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.\n\n**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.\n\n**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**\n> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.\n\n**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**\n> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.\n\n**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**\n> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.\n\n**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**\n> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.\n\n**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.\n\n**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.\n\n**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.\n\n**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**\n> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.\n\n**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**\n> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.\n\n**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**\n> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.\n\n**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**\n> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.\n\n**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> These are two companies that support this work.\n\n**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**\n> So I thank you.\n\n**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Wow.\n\n**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could- Thank you.\n\n**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?\n\n**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**\n> I have a few minutes.\n\n**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.\n\n**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Really nice.\n\n**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm going to let other people go first.\n\n**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I'm loaded with questions.\n\n**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**\n> Alex.\n\n**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.\n\n**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**\n> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.\n\n**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**\n> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.\n\n**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**\n> So that's what takes me into biology.\n\n**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**\n> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.\n\n**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**\n> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.\n\n**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think that's exactly right.\n\n**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**\n> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.\n\n**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**\n> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.\n\n**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**\n> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.\n\n**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?\n\n**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**\n> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?\n\n**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**\n> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.\n\n**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**\n> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.\n\n**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**\n> But they can access these things.\n\n**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**\n> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.\n\n**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**\n> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?\n\n**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**\n> So last question, are we machines ourselves?\n\n**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**\n> Are we technologies of the natural world?\n\n**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**\n> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.\n\n**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**\n> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.\n\n**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is not what machines are.\n\n**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?\n\n**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**\n> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.\n\n**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**\n> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.\n\n**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**\n> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and\n\n**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.\n\n**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Both of those are true.\n\n**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob?\n\n**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**\n> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you, wonderful.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.\n\n**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**\n> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.\n\n**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?\n\n**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good question.\n\n**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**\n> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.\n\n**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.\n\n**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**\n> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.\n\n**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**\n> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.\n\n**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**\n> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.\n\n**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> like this.\n\n**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**\n> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.\n\n**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**\n> Let's take that last example.\n\n**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**\n> So they donate their lung and their trachea.\n\n**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**\n> We buy those cells from a company.\n\n**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**\n> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.\n\n**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**\n> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.\n\n**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**\n> They look kind of like xenobots.\n\n**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**\n> They have some different behaviors.\n\n**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> They have some amazing capabilities.\n\n**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**\n> They can heal neural wounds.\n\n**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**\n> do all kinds of wild stuff.\n\n**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**\n> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?\n\n**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**\n> So the original patient is perhaps dead.\n\n**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> Their cells are not dead.\n\n**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**\n> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.\n\n**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**\n> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?\n\n**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Where is this supposed to go?\n\n**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**\n> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,\n\n**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.\n\n**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**\n> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.\n\n**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**\n> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.\n\n**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**\n> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.\n\n**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**\n> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.\n\n**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**\n> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.\n\n**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**\n> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.\n\n**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> For example, we get tissue from smokers.\n\n**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**\n> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?\n\n**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**\n> You know, it's about a million questions.\n\n**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**\n> death is, yeah, I don't know.\n\n**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**\n> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.\n\n**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**\n> Wonderful, thank you.\n\n**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks.\n\n**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.\n\n**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**\n> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.\n\n**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And if so,\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?\n\n**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**\n> How are they being generated?\n\n**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, great question.\n\n**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**\n> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.\n\n**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**\n> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.\n\n**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**\n> OK, let's say they don't.\n\n**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**\n> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.\n\n**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**\n> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.\n\n**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**\n> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?\n\n**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.\n\n**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?\n\n**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.\n\n**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**\n> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?\n\n**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**\n> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.\n\n**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**\n> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.\n\n**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**\n> They get to the bottom.\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> What do they do?\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> make a beautiful bell curve, right?\n\n**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**\n> They make a Gaussian distribution.\n\n**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**\n> So now you can ask a simple question.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, that's a nice shape.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Where did that come from?\n\n**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**\n> So you're looking at the marbles.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the nails.\n\n**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the wood.\n\n**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**\n> Also not there.\n\n**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where did it come from, right?\n\n**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.\n\n**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**\n> Where is that?\n\n**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**\n> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.\n\n**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**\n> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**\n> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?\n\n**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.\n\n**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> And that's great.\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> Well, guess what?\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> You don't need to look for the third angle.\n\n**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**\n> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.\n\n**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**\n> So where is that?\n\n**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?\n\n**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some philosophical fluff.\n\n**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**\n> This is super practical.\n\n**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**\n> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.\n\n**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**\n> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.\n\n**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**\n> there are three things we need to track.\n\n**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.\n\n**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.\n\n**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not sure.\n\n**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.\n\n**[01:24:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They come from wherever the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My turn.\n\n**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.\n\n**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.\n\n**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.\n\n**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.\n\n**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.\n\n**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.\n\n**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.\n\n**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.\n\n**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> doesn't have to be.\n\n**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?\n\n**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**\n> Absolutely.\n\n**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.\n\n**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.\n\n**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**\n> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?\n\n**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**\n> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.\n\n**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**\n> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.\n\n**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**\n> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.\n\n**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.\n\n**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**\n> So, you know,\n\n**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.\n\n**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**\n> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.\n\n**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**\n> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.\n\n**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?\n\n**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?\n\n**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do anticipation?\n\n**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do generalization?\n\n**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do associative learning?\n\n**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**\n> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.\n\n**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> We could start with models.\n\n**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**\n> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.\n\n**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**\n> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.\n\n**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> And I think you can learn a lot from that.\n\n**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.\n\n**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**\n> Sure, cool.\n\n**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, thank you so much.\n\n**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.\n\n**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**\n> you.\n\n**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**\n> All right, bye bye.\n\n**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Deep breath.\n\n**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for hanging in.\n\n**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.\n\n**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.\n\n**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.\n\n**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing\n\n**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.\n\n**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The steering committee looked at his proposal.\n\n**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.\n\n**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's really making progress.\n\n**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.\n\n**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.\n\n**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He needs a mere another $4,500.\n\n**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can we help him go over the edge?\n\n**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.\n\n**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.\n\n**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.\n\n**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.\n\n**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The floor is yours.\n\n**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.\n\n**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.\n\n**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Thank you, John, and everyone.\n\n**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I think my network is okay.\n\n**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.\n\n**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I know we are all exhausted.\n\n**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to\n\n**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.\n\n**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.\n\n**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.\n\n**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a\n\n**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.\n\n**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.\n\n**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.\n\n**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.\n\n**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.\n\n**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.\n\n**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.\n\n**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Like currently, basically the characteristics.\n\n**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.\n\n**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.\n\n**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.\n\n**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so\n\n**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.\n\n**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.\n\n**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.\n\n**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.\n\n**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.\n\n**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.\n\n**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.\n\n**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.\n\n**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.\n\n**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.\n\n**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.\n\n**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is\n\n**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.\n\n**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.\n\n**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.\n\n**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.\n\n**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.\n\n**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.\n\n**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.\n\n**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> It can be\n\n**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.\n\n**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.\n\n**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.\n\n**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.\n\n**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.\n\n**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> culture, but you're doing other things.\n\n**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.\n\n**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.\n\n**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.\n\n**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.\n\n**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.\n\n**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar\n\n**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> the region.\n\n**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.\n\n**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.\n\n**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.\n\n**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.\n\n**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.\n\n**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> because the number of land to be exploited.\n\n**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.\n\n**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.\n\n**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.\n\n**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.\n\n**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.\n\n**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.\n\n**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's it.\n\n**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.\n\n**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.\n\n**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...\n\n**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.\n\n**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.\n\n**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after you command to national forest.\n\n**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> that's why my last slide.\n\n**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.\n\n**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Before, make sure our dream comes true.\n\n**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.\n\n**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.\n\n**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.\n\n**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.\n\n**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.\n\n**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.\n\n**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.\n\n**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.\n\n**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.\n\n**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.\n\n**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?\n\n**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?\n\n**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.\n\n**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.\n\n**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The cover trees and which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yes, as we're also making\n\n**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.\n\n**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.\n\n**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.\n\n**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.\n\n**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob.\n\n**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**\n> I thank you for great work.\n\n**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**\n> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.\n\n**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**\n> The 2nd 1.\n\n**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**\n> You can ask that straight away.\n\n**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will create.\n\n**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will.\n\n**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?\n\n**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.\n\n**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.\n\n**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's the short answer to your question.\n\n**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**\n> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.\n\n**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.\n\n**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**\n> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.\n\n**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**\n> I am certainly not an expert.\n\n**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**\n> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.\n\n**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**\n> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.\n\n**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that is something.\n\n**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a timely question.\n\n**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.\n\n**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.\n\n**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.\n\n**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.\n\n**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin.\n\n**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.\n\n**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**\n> That's very inspiring.\n\n**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.\n\n**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.\n\n**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.\n\n**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.\n\n**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**\n> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.\n\n**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**\n> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.\n\n**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.\n\n**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?\n\n**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What would a long-term region be for that?\n\n**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.\n\n**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.\n\n**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some\n\n**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.\n\n**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, so we will proceed with this.\n\n**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.\n\n**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.\n\n**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the work here?\n\n**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the actual planting?\n\n**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Do they get paid and so on?\n\n**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How does the labor component figure into this?\n\n**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're\n\n**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.\n\n**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.\n\n**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.\n\n**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?\n\n**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.\n\n**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.\n\n**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.\n\n**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> in our planning, we have\n\n**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.\n\n**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.\n\n**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.\n\n**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.\n\n**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.\n\n**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.\n\n**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.\n\n**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.\n\n**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.\n\n**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.\n\n**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.\n\n**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.\n\n**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.\n\n**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.\n\n**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.\n\n**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.\n\n**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.\n\n**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**\n> I just have a question.\n\n**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.\n\n**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**\n> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?\n\n**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**\n> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.\n\n**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,\n\n**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.\n\n**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.\n\n**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.\n\n**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.\n\n**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.\n\n**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.\n\n**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that would be one of the story.\n\n**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they\n\n**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.\n\n**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.\n\n**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.\n\n**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.\n\n**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, this is our website You\n\n**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.\n\n**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.\n\n**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the test.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If I search for Colombo, there he is.\n\n**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this is the information we have.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.\n\n**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.\n\n**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.\n\n**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.\n\n**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be basically a member space and a public space.\n\n**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.\n\n**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.\n\n**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.\n\n**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.\n\n**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also say that once we have a directory.\n\n**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're going to start encouraging members to become.\n\n**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.\n\n**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.\n\n**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.\n\n**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.\n\n**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.\n\n**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.\n\n**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's 10.56.\n\n**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I have no other items that I really want to get to.\n\n**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you everybody.\n\n**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks for being here.\n\n**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.\n\n**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are

interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.\n\n**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've been following you on social media.\n\n**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.\n\n**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.\n\n**[00:09:34]

He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.\n\n**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.\n\n**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.\n\n**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.\n\n**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.\n\n**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.\n\n**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.\n\n**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.\n\n**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.\n\n**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.\n\n**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.\n\n**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**\n> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.\n\n**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**\n> And then went on to do biology.\n\n**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**\n> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.\n\n**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.\n\n**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**\n> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.\n\n**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.\n\n**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.\n\n**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.\n\n**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**\n> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.\n\n**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.\n\n**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**\n> So living material is an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**\n> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.\n\n**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**\n> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.\n\n**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**\n> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.\n\n**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**\n> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.\n\n**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**\n> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.\n\n**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**\n> And specifically, want to emphasize\n\n**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.\n\n**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**\n> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.\n\n**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**\n> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.\n\n**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**\n> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.\n\n**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**\n> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.\n\n**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**\n> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.\n\n**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> And I will talk about that.\n\n**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.\n\n**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**\n> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.\n\n**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**\n> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.\n\n**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**\n> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.\n\n**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**\n> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.\n\n**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**\n> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.\n\n**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**\n> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.\n\n**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**\n> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**\n> I also think that this can.\n\n**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**\n> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.\n\n**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**\n> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.\n\n**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.\n\n**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**\n> It actually gets much weirder than that.\n\n**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**\n> So let's begin.\n\n**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.\n\n**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.\n\n**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**\n> So there are a couple of things going on here.\n\n**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**\n> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.\n\n**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**\n> we know where\n\n**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**\n> all the animals are here.\n\n**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**\n> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.\n\n**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**\n> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.\n\n**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**\n> We know where all the minds are here.\n\n**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**\n> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.\n\n**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**\n> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.\n\n**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**\n> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't God do it?\n\n**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?\n\n**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**\n> Why did Adam have to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**\n> I think there are two interesting things here.\n\n**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**\n> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.\n\n**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**\n> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.\n\n**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**\n> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.\n\n**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**\n> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have\n\n**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.\n\n**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**\n> so that part we should stick with.\n\n**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**\n> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.\n\n**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**\n> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.\n\n**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**\n> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.\n\n**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**\n> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.\n\n**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?\n\n**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?\n\n**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**\n> How far back here would you like to extend it?\n\n**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**\n> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.\n\n**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.\n\n**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**\n> How did you get from here to here.\n\n**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**\n> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.\n\n**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.\n\n**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.\n\n**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**\n> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.\n\n**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.\n\n**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**\n> And you will have other kinds of beings.\n\n**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**\n> So we'll get to that.\n\n**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm working on a framework.\n\n**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.\n\n**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.\n\n**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**\n> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.\n\n**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**\n> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.\n\n**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**\n> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**\n> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**\n> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.\n\n**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?\n\n**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.\n\n**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**\n> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.\n\n**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**\n> It has to be experimentally valuable.\n\n**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has to move discovery forward.\n\n**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.\n\n**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.\n\n**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...\n\n**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> or pleasant or whatever.\n\n**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**\n> It actually has very practical consequences.\n\n**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**\n> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.\n\n**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**\n> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.\n\n**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**\n> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.\n\n**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**\n> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.\n\n**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.\n\n**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> and are trainable by experiences.\n\n**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.\n\n**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.\n\n**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**\n> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?\n\n**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**\n> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.\n\n**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.\n\n**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**\n> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.\n\n**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**\n> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.\n\n**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**\n> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically\n\n**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.\n\n**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**\n> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.\n\n**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**\n> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.\n\n**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**\n> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.\n\n**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**\n> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> scaling?\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?\n\n**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**\n> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.\n\n**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**\n> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?\n\n**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**\n> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.\n\n**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**\n> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked\n\n**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems\n\n**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.\n\n**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**\n> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.\n\n**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**\n> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.\n\n**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.\n\n**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**\n> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.\n\n**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.\n\n**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**\n> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.\n\n**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> These kinds of systems navigate.\n\n**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**\n> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.\n\n**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**\n> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.\n\n**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**\n> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**\n> and so on.\n\n**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**\n> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.\n\n**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**\n> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.\n\n**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**\n> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**\n> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.\n\n**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**\n> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.\n\n**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**\n> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.\n\n**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**\n> Michael.\n\n**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?\n\n**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**\n> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.\n\n**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this works in real life.\n\n**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**\n> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**\n> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.\n\n**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**\n> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.\n\n**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**\n> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**\n> It really doesn't take much.\n\n**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**\n> And so going to,\n\n**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**\n> beyond the single cell level.\n\n**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**\n> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.\n\n**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**\n> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.\n\n**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**\n> This is a cross-section through an adult human.\n\n**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**\n> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.\n\n**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where does this come from?\n\n**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**\n> How do these cells know to build all of this?\n\n**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.\n\n**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**\n> We have this genome.\n\n**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**\n> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.\n\n**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**\n> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.\n\n**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**\n> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.\n\n**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**\n> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.\n\n**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**\n> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.\n\n**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are the results of...\n\n**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**\n> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.\n\n**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now we need to know a few things.\n\n**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**\n> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know when to stop?\n\n**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**\n> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?\n\n**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**\n> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?\n\n**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**\n> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?\n\n**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**\n> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.\n\n**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**\n> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.\n\n**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?\n\n**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**\n> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.\n\n**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**\n> Now, the obvious biomedical.\n\n**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**\n> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.\n\n**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**\n> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.\n\n**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**\n> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.\n\n**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**\n> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.\n\n**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**\n> You're not going to try to micromanage this.\n\n**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**\n> This is a communications device.\n\n**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.\n\n**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**\n> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.\n\n**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**\n> What is it capable of doing?\n\n**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**\n> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.\n\n**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**\n> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.\n\n**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**\n> let's get it back.\n\n**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**\n> And why is that?\n\n**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.\n\n**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**\n> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**\n> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**\n> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.\n\n**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.\n\n**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**\n> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.\n\n**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**\n> But all of this has not yet been exploited.\n\n**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**\n> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.\n\n**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**\n> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> some sense.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**\n> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.\n\n**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**\n> So let's do a definition first.\n\n**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**\n> I like William James's definition of intelligence.\n\n**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.\n\n**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**\n> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.\n\n**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**\n> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.\n\n**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**\n> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.\n\n**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**\n> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the\n\n**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.\n\n**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**\n> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.\n\n**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**\n> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?\n\n**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.\n\n**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**\n> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.\n\n**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**\n> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.\n\n**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**\n> What we have here is something different, which is that\n\n**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.\n\n**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**\n> That's because the system can do something quite clever.\n\n**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**\n> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.\n\n**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.\n\n**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**\n> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.\n\n**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**\n> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.\n\n**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**\n> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.\n\n**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how these twins are naturally born.\n\n**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**\n> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.\n\n**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.\n\n**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**\n> And if you amputate anywhere along this.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> this limb.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.\n\n**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**\n> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?\n\n**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**\n> So at any position, you can do this.\n\n**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**\n> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.\n\n**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**\n> That's the most amazing part of all of this.\n\n**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**\n> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> When does it stop?\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.\n\n**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**\n> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**\n> You're here.\n\n**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**\n> It immediately recognizes the delta.\n\n**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**\n> It starts to reduce that error.\n\n**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**\n> So you've got an error minimization scheme.\n\n**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.\n\n**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**\n> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.\n\n**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how you recognize goals.\n\n**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**\n> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is\n\n**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**\n> its emergent complexity.\n\n**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**\n> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.\n\n**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**\n> That's not intelligence.\n\n**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**\n> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.\n\n**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**\n> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.\n\n**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**\n> And that's what happens here.\n\n**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**\n> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.\n\n**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**\n> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.\n\n**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**\n> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.\n\n**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**\n> Human livers are highly regenerative.\n\n**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**\n> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.\n\n**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**\n> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.\n\n**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**\n> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.\n\n**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**\n> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> things.\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.\n\n**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**\n> Here's where every cell goes.\n\n**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**\n> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.\n\n**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**\n> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?\n\n**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?\n\n**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**\n> I'll show you both of those things.\n\n**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**\n> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?\n\n**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**\n> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.\n\n**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**\n> are they cooperating?\n\n**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**\n> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.\n\n**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**\n> So just imagine you've got this rat.\n\n**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**\n> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.\n\n**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**\n> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.\n\n**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**\n> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.\n\n**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**\n> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.\n\n**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**\n> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.\n\n**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**\n> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that\n\n**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**\n> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.\n\n**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.\n\n**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**\n> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.\n\n**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?\n\n**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**\n> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?\n\n**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**\n> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.\n\n**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**\n> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.\n\n**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**\n> It's the electrical network.\n\n**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,\n\n**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**\n> is implemented by electrical networks.\n\n**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**\n> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.\n\n**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**\n> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.\n\n**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**\n> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.\n\n**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**\n> It's quite amazing.\n\n**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**\n> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.\n\n**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**\n> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.\n\n**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**\n> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.\n\n**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**\n> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.\n\n**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.\n\n**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**\n> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> it turns\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.\n\n**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**\n> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.\n\n**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**\n> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.\n\n**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**\n> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.\n\n**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**\n> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.\n\n**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**\n> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.\n\n**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**\n> What were these networks thinking about?\n\n**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**\n> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?\n\n**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**\n> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.\n\n**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**\n> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.\n\n**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**\n> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.\n\n**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not a simulation.\n\n**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**\n> This is real animal.\n\n**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**\n> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.\n\n**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.\n\n**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**\n> I want to show you what they look like.\n\n**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**\n> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**\n> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.\n\n**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**\n> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.\n\n**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**\n> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.\n\n**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.\n\n**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**\n> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.\n\n**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**\n> This is where the mouth is going to go.\n\n**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**\n> There's some other placode structures that come out here.\n\n**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.\n\n**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**\n> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.\n\n**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.\n\n**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**\n> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop\n\n**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**\n> on it and to try to decode it.\n\n**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**\n> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.\n\n**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.\n\n**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**\n> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.\n\n**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**\n> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.\n\n**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**\n> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.\n\n**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**\n> And we now have the tools.\n\n**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**\n> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.\n\n**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**\n> So now we can finally answer the question.\n\n**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.\n\n**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.\n\n**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**\n> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?\n\n**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**\n> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.\n\n**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**\n> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.\n\n**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**\n> So from this, we learn three things.\n\n**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.\n\n**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**\n> If you use those same\n\n**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**\n> signals elsewhere in the body.\n\n**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**\n> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.\n\n**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**\n> I could show you lots of other organs.\n\n**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**\n> Second, it's modular.\n\n**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.\n\n**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.\n\n**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**\n> We spoke to them at a very high level.\n\n**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**\n> We said, build an eye here.\n\n**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**\n> That is a very high level subroutine call.\n\n**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**\n> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.\n\n**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is not micromanagement.\n\n**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the genes.\n\n**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the cells.\n\n**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**\n> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.\n\n**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk later.\n\n**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**\n> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.\n\n**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk about how you might do that.\n\n**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...\n\n**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**\n> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.\n\n**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**\n> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?\n\n**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**\n> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.\n\n**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.\n\n**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**\n> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.\n\n**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**\n> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of\n\n**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**\n> participants and so on.\n\n**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**\n> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about\n\n**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**\n> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.\n\n**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**\n> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.\n\n**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**\n> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.\n\n**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**\n> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us\n\n**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**\n> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.\n\n**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**\n> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.\n\n**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.\n\n**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**\n> They are immortal.\n\n**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**\n> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.\n\n**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**\n> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.\n\n**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**\n> They've been around for 400 million years.\n\n**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**\n> These are them.\n\n**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**\n> They do not age and die.\n\n**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.\n\n**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**\n> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.\n\n**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's supposed to be the other way around.\n\n**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**\n> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.\n\n**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**\n> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.\n\n**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**\n> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.\n\n**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**\n> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**\n> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.\n\n**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**\n> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.\n\n**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**\n> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**\n> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.\n\n**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**\n> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.\n\n**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**\n> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.\n\n**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**\n> You can say, no, you should have two heads.\n\n**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**\n> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.\n\n**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.\n\n**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**\n> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.\n\n**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**\n> This is not AI or Photoshop.\n\n**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**\n> These are real animals.\n\n**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**\n> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.\n\n**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**\n> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.\n\n**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.\n\n**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**\n> Yep\n\n**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.\n\n**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> can do that.\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**\n> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.\n\n**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.\n\n**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.\n\n**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.\n\n**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is this is their only now.\n\n**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.\n\n**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**\n> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yep.\n\n**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**\n> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.\n\n**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**\n> Why?\n\n**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**\n> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could\n\n**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**\n> continuously cut them in plain water.\n\n**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**\n> No more manipulation of any kind.\n\n**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**\n> They remain two-headed.\n\n**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.\n\n**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**\n> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**\n> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**\n> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.\n\n**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**\n> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?\n\n**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**\n> And the genomes are exactly identical.\n\n**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing wrong with them.\n\n**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**\n> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?\n\n**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**\n> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.\n\n**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**\n> Not only can you, not only can you\n\n**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**\n> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.\n\n**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**\n> So these are derocephalus.\n\n**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**\n> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.\n\n**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**\n> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.\n\n**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**\n> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.\n\n**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**\n> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?\n\n**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**\n> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.\n\n**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**\n> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.\n\n**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**\n> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.\n\n**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**\n> You don't have to even be\n\n**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**\n> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.\n\n**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.\n\n**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**\n> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.\n\n**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**\n> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.\n\n**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**\n> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.\n\n**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**\n> We would have never known that.\n\n**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**\n> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.\n\n**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**\n> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.\n\n**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**\n> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.\n\n**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**\n> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.\n\n**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**\n> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?\n\n**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.\n\n**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**\n> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.\n\n**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**\n> So lots of evolution going on.\n\n**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**\n> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.\n\n**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**\n> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.\n\n**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**\n> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.\n\n**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**\n> They're put in a little depression.\n\n**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**\n> They could have done many things.\n\n**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**\n> They could have died.\n\n**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**\n> They could have spread away from each other.\n\n**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**\n> They could have formed a flat monolayer.\n\n**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**\n> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.\n\n**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**\n> We call it a xenobot.\n\n**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**\n> Xenobot because Xenopus later.\n\n**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**\n> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.\n\n**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**\n> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.\n\n**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**\n> So they're coordinated to swim.\n\n**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**\n> They can go in circles like this.\n\n**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**\n> They can go back and forth like this.\n\n**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**\n> And remember, this is just skin.\n\n**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**\n> There's no, these are epithelial cells.\n\n**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**\n> There is no neurons here.\n\n**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing else.\n\n**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have collective behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**\n> They can interact with each other.\n\n**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**\n> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.\n\n**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**\n> They can have individual behaviors and so on.\n\n**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.\n\n**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**\n> So it floats down here.\n\n**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**\n> It's swimming along.\n\n**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**\n> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.\n\n**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**\n> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff\n\n**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**\n> here are just the dissociated skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**\n> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.\n\n**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**\n> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.\n\n**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**\n> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?\n\n**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**\n> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.\n\n**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**\n> This is called kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**\n> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.\n\n**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is completely novel.\n\n**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**\n> We did not teach them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**\n> We did not have to force them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**\n> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.\n\n**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**\n> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**\n> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.\n\n**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?\n\n**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**\n> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.\n\n**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**\n> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.\n\n**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**\n> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.\n\n**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**\n> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**\n> They do have a developmental sequence.\n\n**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**\n> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.\n\n**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**\n> I have no idea.\n\n**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**\n> And they have these behaviors.\n\n**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**\n> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.\n\n**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.\n\n**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**\n> All of this emerges spontaneously.\n\n**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just complexity.\n\n**[01:03:46] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to put together a coherent organism with adaptive behaviors that functions in novel circumstances you've never seen before.\n\n**[01:04:00] Michael Levin**\n> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.\n\n**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.\n\n**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**\n> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.\n\n**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**\n> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings\n\n**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**\n> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.\n\n**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**\n> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.\n\n**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**\n> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.\n\n**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**\n> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.\n\n**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**\n> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for\n\n**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**\n> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.\n\n**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**\n> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.\n\n**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**\n> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.\n\n**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are possible.\n\n**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**\n> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.\n\n**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**\n> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.\n\n**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**\n> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.\n\n**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**\n> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.\n\n**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**\n> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.\n\n**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**\n> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.\n\n**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**\n> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**\n> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.\n\n**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**\n> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.\n\n**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**\n> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.\n\n**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**\n> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.\n\n**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**\n> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.\n\n**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**\n> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.\n\n**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**\n> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.\n\n**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**\n> I was looking for...\n\n**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**\n> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.\n\n**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**\n> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.\n\n**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**\n> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.\n\n**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**\n> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.\n\n**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**\n> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.\n\n**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**\n> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.\n\n**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...\n\n**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**\n> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.\n\n**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**\n> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.\n\n**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**\n> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.\n\n**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**\n> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.\n\n**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**\n> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.\n\n**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**\n> imagine something.\n\n**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**\n> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**\n> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**\n> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.\n\n**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**\n> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.\n\n**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**\n> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.\n\n**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**\n> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.\n\n**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**\n> It's like a plasmode.\n\n**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**\n> very rarefied plasma.\n\n**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**\n> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.\n\n**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**\n> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.\n\n**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**\n> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.\n\n**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**\n> And we don't even see it.\n\n**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of information.\n\n**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**\n> They're not real, like us.\n\n**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.\n\n**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**\n> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.\n\n**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**\n> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.\n\n**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**\n> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.\n\n**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**\n> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.\n\n**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**\n> And the others say, well, that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**\n> We're real organisms.\n\n**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**\n> We're solid.\n\n**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**\n> Patterns in gas can't be agents.\n\n**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**\n> What do you mean patterns?\n\n**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**\n> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?\n\n**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**\n> says, well, about 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**\n> But that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**\n> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**\n> That's too short.\n\n**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**\n> so what I think\n\n**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**\n> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.\n\n**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**\n> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.\n\n**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.\n\n**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**\n> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.\n\n**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.\n\n**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**\n> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.\n\n**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**\n> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.\n\n**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> these systems.\n\n**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**\n> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.\n\n**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**\n> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?\n\n**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**\n> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.\n\n**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**\n> So here's where I'll end.\n\n**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**\n> What I tried to tell you today is this.\n\n**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**\n> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.\n\n**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**\n> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.\n\n**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.\n\n**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**\n> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.\n\n**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**\n> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.\n\n**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**\n> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.\n\n**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**\n> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.\n\n**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.\n\n**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.\n\n**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.\n\n**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**\n> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.\n\n**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**\n> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.\n\n**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**\n> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.\n\n**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**\n> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.\n\n**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> These are two companies that support this work.\n\n**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**\n> So I thank you.\n\n**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Wow.\n\n**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could- Thank you.\n\n**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?\n\n**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**\n> I have a few minutes.\n\n**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.\n\n**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Really nice.\n\n**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm going to let other people go first.\n\n**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I'm loaded with questions.\n\n**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**\n> Alex.\n\n**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.\n\n**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**\n> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.\n\n**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**\n> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.\n\n**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**\n> So that's what takes me into biology.\n\n**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**\n> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.\n\n**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**\n> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.\n\n**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think that's exactly right.\n\n**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**\n> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.\n\n**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**\n> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.\n\n**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**\n> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.\n\n**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?\n\n**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**\n> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?\n\n**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**\n> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.\n\n**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**\n> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.\n\n**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**\n> But they can access these things.\n\n**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**\n> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.\n\n**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**\n> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?\n\n**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**\n> So last question, are we machines ourselves?\n\n**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**\n> Are we technologies of the natural world?\n\n**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**\n> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.\n\n**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**\n> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.\n\n**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is not what machines are.\n\n**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?\n\n**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**\n> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.\n\n**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**\n> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.\n\n**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**\n> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and\n\n**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.\n\n**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Both of those are true.\n\n**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob?\n\n**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**\n> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you, wonderful.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.\n\n**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**\n> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.\n\n**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?\n\n**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good question.\n\n**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**\n> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.\n\n**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.\n\n**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**\n> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.\n\n**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**\n> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.\n\n**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**\n> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.\n\n**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> like this.\n\n**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**\n> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.\n\n**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**\n> Let's take that last example.\n\n**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**\n> So they donate their lung and their trachea.\n\n**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**\n> We buy those cells from a company.\n\n**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**\n> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.\n\n**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**\n> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.\n\n**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**\n> They look kind of like xenobots.\n\n**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**\n> They have some different behaviors.\n\n**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> They have some amazing capabilities.\n\n**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**\n> They can heal neural wounds.\n\n**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**\n> do all kinds of wild stuff.\n\n**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**\n> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?\n\n**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**\n> So the original patient is perhaps dead.\n\n**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> Their cells are not dead.\n\n**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**\n> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.\n\n**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**\n> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?\n\n**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Where is this supposed to go?\n\n**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**\n> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,\n\n**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.\n\n**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**\n> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.\n\n**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**\n> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.\n\n**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**\n> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.\n\n**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**\n> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.\n\n**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**\n> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.\n\n**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**\n> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.\n\n**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> For example, we get tissue from smokers.\n\n**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**\n> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?\n\n**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**\n> You know, it's about a million questions.\n\n**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**\n> death is, yeah, I don't know.\n\n**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**\n> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.\n\n**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**\n> Wonderful, thank you.\n\n**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks.\n\n**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.\n\n**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**\n> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.\n\n**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And if so,\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?\n\n**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**\n> How are they being generated?\n\n**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, great question.\n\n**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**\n> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.\n\n**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**\n> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.\n\n**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**\n> OK, let's say they don't.\n\n**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**\n> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.\n\n**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**\n> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.\n\n**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**\n> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?\n\n**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.\n\n**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?\n\n**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.\n\n**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**\n> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?\n\n**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**\n> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.\n\n**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**\n> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.\n\n**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**\n> They get to the bottom.\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> What do they do?\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> make a beautiful bell curve, right?\n\n**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**\n> They make a Gaussian distribution.\n\n**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**\n> So now you can ask a simple question.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, that's a nice shape.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Where did that come from?\n\n**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**\n> So you're looking at the marbles.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the nails.\n\n**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the wood.\n\n**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**\n> Also not there.\n\n**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where did it come from, right?\n\n**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.\n\n**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**\n> Where is that?\n\n**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**\n> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.\n\n**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**\n> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**\n> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?\n\n**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.\n\n**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> And that's great.\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> Well, guess what?\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> You don't need to look for the third angle.\n\n**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**\n> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.\n\n**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**\n> So where is that?\n\n**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?\n\n**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some philosophical fluff.\n\n**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**\n> This is super practical.\n\n**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**\n> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.\n\n**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**\n> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.\n\n**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**\n> there are three things we need to track.\n\n**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.\n\n**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.\n\n**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not sure.\n\n**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.\n\n**[01:24:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They come from wherever the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My turn.\n\n**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.\n\n**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.\n\n**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.\n\n**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.\n\n**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.\n\n**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.\n\n**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.\n\n**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.\n\n**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> doesn't have to be.\n\n**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?\n\n**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**\n> Absolutely.\n\n**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.\n\n**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.\n\n**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**\n> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?\n\n**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**\n> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.\n\n**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**\n> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.\n\n**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**\n> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.\n\n**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.\n\n**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**\n> So, you know,\n\n**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.\n\n**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**\n> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.\n\n**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**\n> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.\n\n**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?\n\n**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?\n\n**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do anticipation?\n\n**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do generalization?\n\n**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do associative learning?\n\n**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**\n> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.\n\n**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> We could start with models.\n\n**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**\n> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.\n\n**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**\n> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.\n\n**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> And I think you can learn a lot from that.\n\n**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.\n\n**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**\n> Sure, cool.\n\n**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, thank you so much.\n\n**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.\n\n**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**\n> you.\n\n**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**\n> All right, bye bye.\n\n**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Deep breath.\n\n**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for hanging in.\n\n**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.\n\n**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.\n\n**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.\n\n**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing\n\n**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.\n\n**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The steering committee looked at his proposal.\n\n**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.\n\n**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's really making progress.\n\n**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.\n\n**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.\n\n**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He needs a mere another $4,500.\n\n**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can we help him go over the edge?\n\n**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.\n\n**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.\n\n**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.\n\n**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.\n\n**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The floor is yours.\n\n**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.\n\n**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.\n\n**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Thank you, John, and everyone.\n\n**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I think my network is okay.\n\n**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.\n\n**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I know we are all exhausted.\n\n**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to\n\n**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.\n\n**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.\n\n**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.\n\n**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a\n\n**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.\n\n**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.\n\n**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.\n\n**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.\n\n**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.\n\n**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.\n\n**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.\n\n**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Like currently, basically the characteristics.\n\n**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.\n\n**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.\n\n**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.\n\n**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so\n\n**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.\n\n**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.\n\n**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.\n\n**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.\n\n**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.\n\n**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.\n\n**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.\n\n**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.\n\n**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.\n\n**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.\n\n**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.\n\n**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is\n\n**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.\n\n**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.\n\n**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.\n\n**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.\n\n**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.\n\n**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.\n\n**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.\n\n**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> It can be\n\n**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.\n\n**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.\n\n**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.\n\n**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.\n\n**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.\n\n**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> culture, but you're doing other things.\n\n**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.\n\n**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.\n\n**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.\n\n**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.\n\n**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.\n\n**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar\n\n**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> the region.\n\n**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.\n\n**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.\n\n**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.\n\n**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.\n\n**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.\n\n**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> because the number of land to be exploited.\n\n**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.\n\n**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.\n\n**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.\n\n**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.\n\n**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.\n\n**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.\n\n**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's it.\n\n**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.\n\n**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.\n\n**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...\n\n**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.\n\n**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.\n\n**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after you command to national forest.\n\n**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> that's why my last slide.\n\n**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.\n\n**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Before, make sure our dream comes true.\n\n**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.\n\n**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.\n\n**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.\n\n**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.\n\n**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.\n\n**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.\n\n**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.\n\n**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.\n\n**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.\n\n**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.\n\n**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?\n\n**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?\n\n**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.\n\n**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.\n\n**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The cover trees and which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yes, as we're also making\n\n**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.\n\n**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.\n\n**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.\n\n**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.\n\n**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob.\n\n**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**\n> I thank you for great work.\n\n**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**\n> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.\n\n**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**\n> The 2nd 1.\n\n**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**\n> You can ask that straight away.\n\n**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will create.\n\n**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will.\n\n**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?\n\n**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.\n\n**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.\n\n**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's the short answer to your question.\n\n**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**\n> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.\n\n**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.\n\n**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**\n> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.\n\n**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**\n> I am certainly not an expert.\n\n**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**\n> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.\n\n**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**\n> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.\n\n**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that is something.\n\n**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a timely question.\n\n**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.\n\n**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.\n\n**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.\n\n**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.\n\n**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin.\n\n**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.\n\n**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**\n> That's very inspiring.\n\n**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.\n\n**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.\n\n**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.\n\n**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.\n\n**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**\n> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.\n\n**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**\n> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.\n\n**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.\n\n**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?\n\n**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What would a long-term region be for that?\n\n**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.\n\n**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.\n\n**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some\n\n**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.\n\n**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, so we will proceed with this.\n\n**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.\n\n**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.\n\n**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the work here?\n\n**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the actual planting?\n\n**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Do they get paid and so on?\n\n**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How does the labor component figure into this?\n\n**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're\n\n**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.\n\n**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.\n\n**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.\n\n**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?\n\n**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.\n\n**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.\n\n**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.\n\n**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> in our planning, we have\n\n**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.\n\n**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.\n\n**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.\n\n**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.\n\n**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.\n\n**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.\n\n**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.\n\n**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.\n\n**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.\n\n**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.\n\n**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.\n\n**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.\n\n**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.\n\n**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.\n\n**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.\n\n**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.\n\n**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.\n\n**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**\n> I just have a question.\n\n**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.\n\n**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**\n> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?\n\n**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**\n> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.\n\n**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,\n\n**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.\n\n**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.\n\n**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.\n\n**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.\n\n**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.\n\n**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.\n\n**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that would be one of the story.\n\n**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they\n\n**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.\n\n**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.\n\n**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.\n\n**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.\n\n**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, this is our website You\n\n**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.\n\n**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.\n\n**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the test.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If I search for Colombo, there he is.\n\n**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this is the information we have.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.\n\n**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.\n\n**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.\n\n**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.\n\n**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be basically a member space and a public space.\n\n**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.\n\n**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.\n\n**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.\n\n**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.\n\n**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also say that once we have a directory.\n\n**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're going to start encouraging members to become.\n\n**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.\n\n**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.\n\n**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.\n\n**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.\n\n**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.\n\n**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.\n\n**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's 10.56.\n\n**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I have no other items that I really want to get to.\n\n**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you everybody.\n\n**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks for being here.\n\n**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you,

story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.\n\n**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.\n\n**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.\n\n**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.\n\n**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, hello, Kwaki.\n\n**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning.\n\n**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Good morning,

And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.\n\n**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I've been following you on social media.\n\n**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.\n\n**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.\n\n**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Ali bin Shahid.\n\n**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think is also on the Bezos grant.\n\n**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.\n\n**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.\n\n**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.\n\n**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.\n\n**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.\n\n**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.\n\n**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.\n\n**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.\n\n**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.\n\n**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.\n\n**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.\n\n**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**\n> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.\n\n**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**\n> And then went on to do biology.\n\n**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**\n> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.\n\n**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.\n\n**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**\n> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.\n\n**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.\n\n**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.\n\n**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.\n\n**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**\n> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.\n\n**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.\n\n**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**\n> So living material is an agential material.\n\n**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**\n> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.\n\n**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**\n> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.\n\n**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**\n> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.\n\n**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**\n> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.\n\n**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**\n> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.\n\n**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**\n> And specifically, want to emphasize\n\n**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.\n\n**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**\n> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.\n\n**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**\n> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.\n\n**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**\n> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.\n\n**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**\n> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.\n\n**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**\n> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.\n\n**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> And I will talk about that.\n\n**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.\n\n**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**\n> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.\n\n**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**\n> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.\n\n**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**\n> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.\n\n**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**\n> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.\n\n**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**\n> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.\n\n**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**\n> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.\n\n**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**\n> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**\n> I also think that this can.\n\n**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**\n> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.\n\n**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**\n> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.\n\n**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.\n\n**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**\n> It actually gets much weirder than that.\n\n**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**\n> So let's begin.\n\n**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.\n\n**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.\n\n**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**\n> So there are a couple of things going on here.\n\n**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**\n> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.\n\n**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**\n> we know where\n\n**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**\n> all the animals are here.\n\n**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**\n> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.\n\n**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**\n> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.\n\n**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**\n> We know where all the minds are here.\n\n**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**\n> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.\n\n**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**\n> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.\n\n**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**\n> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't God do it?\n\n**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?\n\n**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**\n> Why did Adam have to name the animals?\n\n**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**\n> I think there are two interesting things here.\n\n**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**\n> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.\n\n**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**\n> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.\n\n**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**\n> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.\n\n**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**\n> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have\n\n**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.\n\n**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**\n> so that part we should stick with.\n\n**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**\n> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.\n\n**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**\n> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.\n\n**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**\n> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.\n\n**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**\n> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.\n\n**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?\n\n**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?\n\n**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**\n> How far back here would you like to extend it?\n\n**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**\n> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.\n\n**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.\n\n**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**\n> How did you get from here to here.\n\n**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**\n> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.\n\n**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.\n\n**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.\n\n**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**\n> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.\n\n**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.\n\n**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**\n> And you will have other kinds of beings.\n\n**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**\n> So we'll get to that.\n\n**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm working on a framework.\n\n**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.\n\n**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.\n\n**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**\n> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.\n\n**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**\n> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.\n\n**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**\n> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**\n> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.\n\n**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**\n> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.\n\n**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?\n\n**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.\n\n**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**\n> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.\n\n**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**\n> It has to be experimentally valuable.\n\n**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has to move discovery forward.\n\n**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.\n\n**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.\n\n**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...\n\n**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> or pleasant or whatever.\n\n**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**\n> It actually has very practical consequences.\n\n**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**\n> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.\n\n**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**\n> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.\n\n**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**\n> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.\n\n**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**\n> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.\n\n**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.\n\n**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> and are trainable by experiences.\n\n**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.\n\n**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.\n\n**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**\n> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?\n\n**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**\n> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.\n\n**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**\n> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.\n\n**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**\n> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.\n\n**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**\n> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.\n\n**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**\n> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically\n\n**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.\n\n**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**\n> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.\n\n**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**\n> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.\n\n**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**\n> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.\n\n**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**\n> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> scaling?\n\n**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**\n> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?\n\n**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**\n> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.\n\n**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**\n> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?\n\n**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**\n> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.\n\n**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**\n> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked\n\n**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems\n\n**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.\n\n**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**\n> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.\n\n**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**\n> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.\n\n**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.\n\n**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**\n> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.\n\n**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.\n\n**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**\n> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.\n\n**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> These kinds of systems navigate.\n\n**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**\n> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.\n\n**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**\n> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.\n\n**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.\n\n**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**\n> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**\n> and so on.\n\n**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**\n> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.\n\n**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**\n> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.\n\n**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**\n> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**\n> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.\n\n**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**\n> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.\n\n**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**\n> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.\n\n**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**\n> Michael.\n\n**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?\n\n**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**\n> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.\n\n**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this works in real life.\n\n**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**\n> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.\n\n**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**\n> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.\n\n**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**\n> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.\n\n**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**\n> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.\n\n**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**\n> It really doesn't take much.\n\n**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**\n> And so going to,\n\n**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**\n> beyond the single cell level.\n\n**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**\n> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.\n\n**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**\n> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.\n\n**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**\n> This is a cross-section through an adult human.\n\n**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**\n> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.\n\n**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where does this come from?\n\n**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**\n> How do these cells know to build all of this?\n\n**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**\n> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.\n\n**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**\n> We have this genome.\n\n**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**\n> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.\n\n**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**\n> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.\n\n**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**\n> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.\n\n**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**\n> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.\n\n**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**\n> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.\n\n**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are the results of...\n\n**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**\n> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.\n\n**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now we need to know a few things.\n\n**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**\n> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**\n> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?\n\n**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know when to stop?\n\n**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**\n> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?\n\n**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**\n> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?\n\n**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**\n> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?\n\n**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**\n> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.\n\n**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**\n> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.\n\n**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**\n> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?\n\n**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**\n> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.\n\n**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**\n> Now, the obvious biomedical.\n\n**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**\n> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.\n\n**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**\n> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.\n\n**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**\n> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.\n\n**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**\n> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.\n\n**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**\n> You're not going to try to micromanage this.\n\n**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**\n> This is a communications device.\n\n**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.\n\n**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**\n> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.\n\n**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**\n> What is it capable of doing?\n\n**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**\n> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.\n\n**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**\n> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.\n\n**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**\n> let's get it back.\n\n**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**\n> And why is that?\n\n**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.\n\n**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**\n> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**\n> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.\n\n**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**\n> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.\n\n**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.\n\n**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**\n> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.\n\n**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**\n> But all of this has not yet been exploited.\n\n**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**\n> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.\n\n**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**\n> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> some sense.\n\n**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**\n> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.\n\n**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**\n> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.\n\n**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**\n> So let's do a definition first.\n\n**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**\n> I like William James's definition of intelligence.\n\n**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.\n\n**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**\n> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.\n\n**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**\n> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.\n\n**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**\n> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.\n\n**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**\n> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the\n\n**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.\n\n**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**\n> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.\n\n**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**\n> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?\n\n**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**\n> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.\n\n**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**\n> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.\n\n**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**\n> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.\n\n**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**\n> What we have here is something different, which is that\n\n**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**\n> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.\n\n**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**\n> That's because the system can do something quite clever.\n\n**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**\n> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.\n\n**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.\n\n**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**\n> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.\n\n**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**\n> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.\n\n**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**\n> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.\n\n**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how these twins are naturally born.\n\n**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**\n> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.\n\n**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.\n\n**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**\n> And if you amputate anywhere along this.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> this limb.\n\n**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.\n\n**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**\n> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?\n\n**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**\n> So at any position, you can do this.\n\n**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**\n> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.\n\n**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**\n> That's the most amazing part of all of this.\n\n**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**\n> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> When does it stop?\n\n**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**\n> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.\n\n**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**\n> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**\n> You're here.\n\n**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**\n> It immediately recognizes the delta.\n\n**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**\n> It starts to reduce that error.\n\n**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**\n> So you've got an error minimization scheme.\n\n**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**\n> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.\n\n**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**\n> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.\n\n**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**\n> And this is how you recognize goals.\n\n**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**\n> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is\n\n**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**\n> its emergent complexity.\n\n**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**\n> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.\n\n**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**\n> That's not intelligence.\n\n**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**\n> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.\n\n**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**\n> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.\n\n**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**\n> And that's what happens here.\n\n**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**\n> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.\n\n**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**\n> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.\n\n**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**\n> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.\n\n**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**\n> Human livers are highly regenerative.\n\n**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**\n> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.\n\n**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**\n> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.\n\n**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**\n> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.\n\n**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**\n> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> things.\n\n**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**\n> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.\n\n**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**\n> Here's where every cell goes.\n\n**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**\n> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.\n\n**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**\n> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?\n\n**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?\n\n**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**\n> I'll show you both of those things.\n\n**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**\n> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?\n\n**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**\n> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.\n\n**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**\n> are they cooperating?\n\n**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**\n> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.\n\n**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**\n> So just imagine you've got this rat.\n\n**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**\n> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.\n\n**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**\n> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.\n\n**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**\n> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.\n\n**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**\n> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.\n\n**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**\n> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.\n\n**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**\n> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that\n\n**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**\n> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.\n\n**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**\n> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.\n\n**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**\n> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.\n\n**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?\n\n**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**\n> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?\n\n**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**\n> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.\n\n**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**\n> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.\n\n**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**\n> It's the electrical network.\n\n**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,\n\n**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**\n> is implemented by electrical networks.\n\n**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**\n> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.\n\n**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**\n> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.\n\n**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**\n> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.\n\n**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**\n> It's quite amazing.\n\n**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**\n> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.\n\n**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**\n> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.\n\n**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**\n> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.\n\n**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**\n> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.\n\n**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.\n\n**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**\n> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> it turns\n\n**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**\n> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.\n\n**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**\n> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.\n\n**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**\n> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.\n\n**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**\n> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.\n\n**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**\n> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.\n\n**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**\n> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.\n\n**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**\n> What were these networks thinking about?\n\n**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**\n> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?\n\n**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**\n> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**\n> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.\n\n**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**\n> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.\n\n**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**\n> So this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**\n> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.\n\n**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not a simulation.\n\n**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**\n> This is real animal.\n\n**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**\n> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.\n\n**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.\n\n**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**\n> I want to show you what they look like.\n\n**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**\n> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.\n\n**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**\n> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.\n\n**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**\n> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.\n\n**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**\n> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.\n\n**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**\n> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.\n\n**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**\n> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.\n\n**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**\n> This is where the mouth is going to go.\n\n**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**\n> There's some other placode structures that come out here.\n\n**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.\n\n**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**\n> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.\n\n**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.\n\n**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**\n> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop\n\n**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**\n> on it and to try to decode it.\n\n**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**\n> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.\n\n**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**\n> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.\n\n**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**\n> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.\n\n**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**\n> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.\n\n**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**\n> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.\n\n**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**\n> And we now have the tools.\n\n**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**\n> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.\n\n**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**\n> So now we can finally answer the question.\n\n**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> How do they know?\n\n**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**\n> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.\n\n**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**\n> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.\n\n**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**\n> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?\n\n**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**\n> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.\n\n**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**\n> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.\n\n**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**\n> So from this, we learn three things.\n\n**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**\n> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.\n\n**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**\n> If you use those same\n\n**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**\n> signals elsewhere in the body.\n\n**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**\n> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.\n\n**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**\n> I could show you lots of other organs.\n\n**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**\n> Second, it's modular.\n\n**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.\n\n**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**\n> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.\n\n**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**\n> We spoke to them at a very high level.\n\n**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**\n> We said, build an eye here.\n\n**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**\n> That is a very high level subroutine call.\n\n**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**\n> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.\n\n**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is not micromanagement.\n\n**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the genes.\n\n**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**\n> We are not talking to the cells.\n\n**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**\n> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.\n\n**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**\n> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.\n\n**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk later.\n\n**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**\n> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.\n\n**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**\n> And we can talk about how you might do that.\n\n**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...\n\n**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**\n> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.\n\n**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**\n> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?\n\n**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**\n> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.\n\n**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.\n\n**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**\n> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.\n\n**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**\n> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of\n\n**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**\n> participants and so on.\n\n**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**\n> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about\n\n**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**\n> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.\n\n**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**\n> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.\n\n**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**\n> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.\n\n**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**\n> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us\n\n**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**\n> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.\n\n**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**\n> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.\n\n**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.\n\n**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**\n> They are immortal.\n\n**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**\n> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.\n\n**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**\n> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.\n\n**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**\n> They've been around for 400 million years.\n\n**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**\n> These are them.\n\n**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**\n> They do not age and die.\n\n**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.\n\n**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**\n> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.\n\n**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's supposed to be the other way around.\n\n**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**\n> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.\n\n**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**\n> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.\n\n**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**\n> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.\n\n**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**\n> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**\n> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.\n\n**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**\n> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.\n\n**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**\n> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?\n\n**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**\n> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.\n\n**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**\n> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.\n\n**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**\n> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.\n\n**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**\n> You can say, no, you should have two heads.\n\n**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**\n> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.\n\n**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.\n\n**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**\n> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.\n\n**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**\n> This is not AI or Photoshop.\n\n**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**\n> These are real animals.\n\n**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**\n> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.\n\n**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**\n> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.\n\n**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.\n\n**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**\n> Yep\n\n**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.\n\n**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> can do that.\n\n**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**\n> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.\n\n**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.\n\n**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.\n\n**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**\n> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.\n\n**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**\n> This is this is their only now.\n\n**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.\n\n**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**\n> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**\n> Yep.\n\n**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**\n> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.\n\n**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**\n> Why?\n\n**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**\n> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could\n\n**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**\n> continuously cut them in plain water.\n\n**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**\n> No more manipulation of any kind.\n\n**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**\n> They remain two-headed.\n\n**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**\n> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.\n\n**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**\n> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**\n> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.\n\n**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**\n> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.\n\n**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**\n> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?\n\n**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**\n> And the genomes are exactly identical.\n\n**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing wrong with them.\n\n**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**\n> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?\n\n**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**\n> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**\n> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.\n\n**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**\n> Not only can you, not only can you\n\n**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**\n> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.\n\n**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**\n> So these are derocephalus.\n\n**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**\n> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.\n\n**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**\n> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.\n\n**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**\n> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.\n\n**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**\n> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.\n\n**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**\n> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?\n\n**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**\n> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.\n\n**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**\n> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.\n\n**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**\n> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.\n\n**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**\n> You don't have to even be\n\n**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**\n> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.\n\n**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.\n\n**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**\n> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.\n\n**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**\n> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.\n\n**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**\n> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.\n\n**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**\n> We would have never known that.\n\n**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**\n> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.\n\n**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**\n> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.\n\n**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**\n> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.\n\n**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**\n> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.\n\n**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**\n> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?\n\n**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**\n> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.\n\n**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**\n> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.\n\n**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**\n> So lots of evolution going on.\n\n**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**\n> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.\n\n**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**\n> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.\n\n**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**\n> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.\n\n**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**\n> They're put in a little depression.\n\n**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**\n> They could have done many things.\n\n**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**\n> They could have died.\n\n**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**\n> They could have spread away from each other.\n\n**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**\n> They could have formed a flat monolayer.\n\n**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**\n> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.\n\n**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**\n> We call it a xenobot.\n\n**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**\n> Xenobot because Xenopus later.\n\n**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**\n> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.\n\n**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**\n> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.\n\n**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**\n> So they're coordinated to swim.\n\n**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**\n> They can go in circles like this.\n\n**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**\n> They can go back and forth like this.\n\n**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**\n> And remember, this is just skin.\n\n**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**\n> There's no, these are epithelial cells.\n\n**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**\n> There is no neurons here.\n\n**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**\n> There's nothing else.\n\n**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**\n> They have collective behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**\n> They can interact with each other.\n\n**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**\n> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.\n\n**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**\n> They can have individual behaviors and so on.\n\n**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**\n> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.\n\n**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**\n> So it floats down here.\n\n**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**\n> It's swimming along.\n\n**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**\n> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.\n\n**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**\n> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**\n> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.\n\n**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**\n> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff\n\n**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**\n> here are just the dissociated skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**\n> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.\n\n**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**\n> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.\n\n**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**\n> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?\n\n**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**\n> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.\n\n**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**\n> This is called kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**\n> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.\n\n**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**\n> This is completely novel.\n\n**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**\n> We did not teach them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**\n> We did not have to force them to do this.\n\n**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**\n> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.\n\n**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**\n> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.\n\n**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**\n> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.\n\n**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?\n\n**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**\n> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.\n\n**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**\n> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.\n\n**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**\n> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.\n\n**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**\n> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**\n> They do have a developmental sequence.\n\n**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**\n> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.\n\n**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**\n> I have no idea.\n\n**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**\n> And they have these behaviors.\n\n**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**\n> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.\n\n**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any xenobots.\n\n**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.\n\n**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**\n> There's never been any kinematic replication.\n\n**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**\n> All of this emerges spontaneously.\n\n**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**\n> It's not just complexity.\n\n**[01:03:46] Michael Levin**\n> It's the ability to put together a coherent organism with adaptive behaviors that functions in novel circumstances you've never seen before.\n\n**[01:04:00] Michael Levin**\n> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.\n\n**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**\n> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.\n\n**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**\n> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.\n\n**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**\n> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings\n\n**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**\n> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.\n\n**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**\n> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.\n\n**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**\n> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.\n\n**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**\n> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.\n\n**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**\n> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for\n\n**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**\n> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.\n\n**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**\n> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.\n\n**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**\n> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.\n\n**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**\n> All of these things are possible.\n\n**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**\n> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.\n\n**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**\n> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.\n\n**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**\n> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.\n\n**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**\n> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.\n\n**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**\n> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.\n\n**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**\n> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.\n\n**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**\n> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.\n\n**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**\n> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.\n\n**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**\n> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.\n\n**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**\n> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.\n\n**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**\n> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.\n\n**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**\n> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.\n\n**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**\n> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.\n\n**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**\n> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.\n\n**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**\n> I was looking for...\n\n**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**\n> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.\n\n**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**\n> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.\n\n**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**\n> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.\n\n**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**\n> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.\n\n**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**\n> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.\n\n**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**\n> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.\n\n**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...\n\n**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**\n> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.\n\n**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**\n> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.\n\n**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**\n> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.\n\n**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**\n> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.\n\n**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**\n> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.\n\n**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**\n> imagine something.\n\n**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**\n> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**\n> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.\n\n**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**\n> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.\n\n**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**\n> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.\n\n**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**\n> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.\n\n**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**\n> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.\n\n**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**\n> It's like a plasmode.\n\n**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**\n> very rarefied plasma.\n\n**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**\n> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.\n\n**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**\n> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.\n\n**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**\n> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.\n\n**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**\n> And we don't even see it.\n\n**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**\n> They're patterns of information.\n\n**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**\n> They're not real, like us.\n\n**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.\n\n**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**\n> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.\n\n**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**\n> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.\n\n**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**\n> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.\n\n**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**\n> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.\n\n**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**\n> And the others say, well, that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**\n> We're real organisms.\n\n**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**\n> We're solid.\n\n**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**\n> Patterns in gas can't be agents.\n\n**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**\n> What do you mean patterns?\n\n**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**\n> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?\n\n**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**\n> says, well, about 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**\n> But that's crazy.\n\n**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**\n> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.\n\n**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**\n> That's too short.\n\n**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**\n> so what I think\n\n**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**\n> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.\n\n**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**\n> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.\n\n**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.\n\n**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**\n> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.\n\n**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.\n\n**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**\n> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.\n\n**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**\n> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.\n\n**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**\n> these systems.\n\n**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**\n> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.\n\n**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**\n> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?\n\n**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**\n> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.\n\n**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**\n> So here's where I'll end.\n\n**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**\n> What I tried to tell you today is this.\n\n**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**\n> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.\n\n**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**\n> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.\n\n**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**\n> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.\n\n**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**\n> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.\n\n**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**\n> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.\n\n**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**\n> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.\n\n**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**\n> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.\n\n**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**\n> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.\n\n**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**\n> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.\n\n**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**\n> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.\n\n**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**\n> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.\n\n**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**\n> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.\n\n**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**\n> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.\n\n**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**\n> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.\n\n**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**\n> These are two companies that support this work.\n\n**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**\n> So I thank you.\n\n**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Wow.\n\n**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could- Thank you.\n\n**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?\n\n**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**\n> I have a few minutes.\n\n**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.\n\n**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Really nice.\n\n**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I'm going to let other people go first.\n\n**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But I'm loaded with questions.\n\n**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**\n> Alex.\n\n**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.\n\n**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**\n> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.\n\n**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**\n> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.\n\n**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**\n> So that's what takes me into biology.\n\n**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**\n> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.\n\n**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**\n> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.\n\n**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**\n> I think that's exactly right.\n\n**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**\n> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.\n\n**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**\n> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.\n\n**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**\n> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.\n\n**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**\n> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?\n\n**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**\n> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?\n\n**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**\n> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.\n\n**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**\n> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.\n\n**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**\n> But they can access these things.\n\n**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**\n> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.\n\n**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**\n> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?\n\n**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**\n> So last question, are we machines ourselves?\n\n**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**\n> Are we technologies of the natural world?\n\n**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**\n> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.\n\n**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**\n> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.\n\n**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**\n> This is not what machines are.\n\n**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**\n> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?\n\n**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**\n> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.\n\n**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**\n> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.\n\n**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**\n> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and\n\n**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**\n> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.\n\n**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Both of those are true.\n\n**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob?\n\n**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**\n> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you, wonderful.\n\n**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**\n> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.\n\n**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**\n> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.\n\n**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?\n\n**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good.\n\n**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**\n> Good question.\n\n**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**\n> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.\n\n**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**\n> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.\n\n**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**\n> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.\n\n**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**\n> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.\n\n**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**\n> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.\n\n**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**\n> like this.\n\n**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**\n> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.\n\n**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**\n> Let's take that last example.\n\n**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**\n> So they donate their lung and their trachea.\n\n**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**\n> We buy those cells from a company.\n\n**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**\n> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.\n\n**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**\n> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.\n\n**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**\n> They look kind of like xenobots.\n\n**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**\n> They have some different behaviors.\n\n**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**\n> They have some amazing capabilities.\n\n**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**\n> They can heal neural wounds.\n\n**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**\n> do all kinds of wild stuff.\n\n**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**\n> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?\n\n**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**\n> So the original patient is perhaps dead.\n\n**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**\n> Their cells are not dead.\n\n**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**\n> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.\n\n**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**\n> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?\n\n**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Where is this supposed to go?\n\n**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**\n> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,\n\n**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**\n> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.\n\n**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**\n> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.\n\n**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**\n> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.\n\n**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**\n> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.\n\n**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**\n> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.\n\n**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**\n> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.\n\n**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**\n> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.\n\n**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**\n> For example, we get tissue from smokers.\n\n**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**\n> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?\n\n**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**\n> You know, it's about a million questions.\n\n**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**\n> death is, yeah, I don't know.\n\n**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**\n> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.\n\n**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**\n> Wonderful, thank you.\n\n**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks.\n\n**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.\n\n**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**\n> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.\n\n**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And if so,\n\n**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?\n\n**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**\n> How are they being generated?\n\n**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, great question.\n\n**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**\n> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.\n\n**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**\n> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.\n\n**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**\n> OK, let's say they don't.\n\n**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**\n> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.\n\n**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**\n> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.\n\n**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**\n> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?\n\n**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**\n> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.\n\n**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**\n> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?\n\n**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**\n> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.\n\n**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**\n> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?\n\n**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**\n> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.\n\n**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**\n> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.\n\n**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**\n> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**\n> They get to the bottom.\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> What do they do?\n\n**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**\n> make a beautiful bell curve, right?\n\n**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**\n> They make a Gaussian distribution.\n\n**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**\n> So now you can ask a simple question.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, that's a nice shape.\n\n**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**\n> Where did that come from?\n\n**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**\n> So you're looking at the marbles.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the nails.\n\n**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's not there.\n\n**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**\n> You're looking at the wood.\n\n**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**\n> Also not there.\n\n**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**\n> Where did it come from, right?\n\n**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**\n> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.\n\n**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**\n> Where is that?\n\n**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**\n> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.\n\n**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**\n> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**\n> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?\n\n**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**\n> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.\n\n**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**\n> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> And that's great.\n\n**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**\n> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> Well, guess what?\n\n**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**\n> You don't need to look for the third angle.\n\n**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**\n> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.\n\n**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**\n> So where is that?\n\n**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**\n> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?\n\n**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**\n> This is not some philosophical fluff.\n\n**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**\n> This is super practical.\n\n**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**\n> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.\n\n**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**\n> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.\n\n**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**\n> there are three things we need to track.\n\n**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.\n\n**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**\n> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.\n\n**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**\n> I'm not sure.\n\n**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**\n> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.\n\n**[01:24:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They come from wherever the laws of mathematics come from.\n\n**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My turn.\n\n**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.\n\n**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.\n\n**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.\n\n**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.\n\n**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.\n\n**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.\n\n**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.\n\n**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.\n\n**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> doesn't have to be.\n\n**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?\n\n**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**\n> Absolutely.\n\n**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**\n> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.\n\n**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**\n> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.\n\n**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**\n> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?\n\n**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**\n> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.\n\n**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**\n> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.\n\n**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**\n> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.\n\n**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**\n> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.\n\n**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**\n> So, you know,\n\n**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**\n> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.\n\n**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**\n> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.\n\n**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**\n> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.\n\n**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**\n> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?\n\n**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**\n> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?\n\n**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do anticipation?\n\n**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do generalization?\n\n**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**\n> Does it do associative learning?\n\n**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**\n> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.\n\n**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**\n> We could start with models.\n\n**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**\n> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.\n\n**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**\n> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.\n\n**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**\n> And I think you can learn a lot from that.\n\n**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.\n\n**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.\n\n**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**\n> Sure, cool.\n\n**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**\n> Yeah, thank you so much.\n\n**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**\n> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.\n\n**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**\n> you.\n\n**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**\n> All right, bye bye.\n\n**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Deep breath.\n\n**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you for hanging in.\n\n**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.\n\n**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.\n\n**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.\n\n**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing\n\n**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.\n\n**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The steering committee looked at his proposal.\n\n**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.\n\n**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's really making progress.\n\n**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.\n\n**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.\n\n**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> He needs a mere another $4,500.\n\n**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Can we help him go over the edge?\n\n**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.\n\n**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.\n\n**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.\n\n**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.\n\n**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> The floor is yours.\n\n**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.\n\n**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.\n\n**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah.\n\n**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Thank you, John, and everyone.\n\n**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I think my network is okay.\n\n**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.\n\n**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I know we are all exhausted.\n\n**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to\n\n**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.\n\n**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.\n\n**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.\n\n**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a\n\n**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.\n\n**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.\n\n**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.\n\n**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.\n\n**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.\n\n**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.\n\n**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.\n\n**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Like currently, basically the characteristics.\n\n**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.\n\n**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.\n\n**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.\n\n**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so\n\n**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.\n\n**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.\n\n**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.\n\n**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.\n\n**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.\n\n**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.\n\n**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.\n\n**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.\n\n**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.\n\n**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.\n\n**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.\n\n**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is\n\n**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.\n\n**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.\n\n**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.\n\n**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.\n\n**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.\n\n**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.\n\n**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.\n\n**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> It can be\n\n**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.\n\n**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.\n\n**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.\n\n**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.\n\n**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.\n\n**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> culture, but you're doing other things.\n\n**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.\n\n**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.\n\n**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.\n\n**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.\n\n**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.\n\n**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar\n\n**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> the region.\n\n**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.\n\n**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.\n\n**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.\n\n**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.\n\n**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.\n\n**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> because the number of land to be exploited.\n\n**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.\n\n**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.\n\n**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.\n\n**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.\n\n**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.\n\n**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.\n\n**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's it.\n\n**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.\n\n**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.\n\n**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...\n\n**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.\n\n**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.\n\n**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after you command to national forest.\n\n**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> that's why my last slide.\n\n**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.\n\n**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Before, make sure our dream comes true.\n\n**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.\n\n**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.\n\n**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.\n\n**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.\n\n**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.\n\n**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.\n\n**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.\n\n**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.\n\n**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.\n\n**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you very much.\n\n**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.\n\n**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?\n\n**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?\n\n**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.\n\n**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.\n\n**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> The cover trees and which one should be planted?\n\n**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yes, as we're also making\n\n**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.\n\n**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.\n\n**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.\n\n**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.\n\n**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Rob.\n\n**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**\n> I thank you for great work.\n\n**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**\n> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.\n\n**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**\n> The 2nd 1.\n\n**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**\n> You can ask that straight away.\n\n**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We will create.\n\n**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> will.\n\n**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?\n\n**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.\n\n**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.\n\n**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's the short answer to your question.\n\n**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**\n> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.\n\n**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**\n> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.\n\n**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**\n> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.\n\n**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**\n> I am certainly not an expert.\n\n**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**\n> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.\n\n**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**\n> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.\n\n**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So that is something.\n\n**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's a timely question.\n\n**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.\n\n**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.\n\n**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.\n\n**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.\n\n**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Joaquin.\n\n**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yes.\n\n**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.\n\n**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**\n> That's very inspiring.\n\n**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.\n\n**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**\n> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.\n\n**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.\n\n**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.\n\n**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**\n> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.\n\n**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**\n> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.\n\n**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**\n> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.\n\n**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**\n> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?\n\n**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**\n> What would a long-term region be for that?\n\n**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.\n\n**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.\n\n**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some\n\n**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.\n\n**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay, so we will proceed with this.\n\n**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.\n\n**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.\n\n**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the work here?\n\n**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who does the actual planting?\n\n**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Do they get paid and so on?\n\n**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> How does the labor component figure into this?\n\n**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're\n\n**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.\n\n**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.\n\n**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you.\n\n**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.\n\n**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?\n\n**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Okay.\n\n**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.\n\n**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.\n\n**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.\n\n**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> in our planning, we have\n\n**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.\n\n**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.\n\n**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.\n\n**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.\n\n**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.\n\n**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.\n\n**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.\n\n**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.\n\n**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.\n\n**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.\n\n**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.\n\n**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.\n\n**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.\n\n**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.\n\n**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.\n\n**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.\n\n**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.\n\n**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?\n\n**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**\n> I just have a question.\n\n**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**\n> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.\n\n**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**\n> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?\n\n**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**\n> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.\n\n**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,\n\n**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.\n\n**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.\n\n**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.\n\n**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.\n\n**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.\n\n**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.\n\n**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> So that would be one of the story.\n\n**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they\n\n**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**\n> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.\n\n**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.\n\n**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.\n\n**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.\n\n**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Um, this is our website You\n\n**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.\n\n**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.\n\n**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> This is the test.\n\n**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If I search for Colombo, there he is.\n\n**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this is the information we have.\n\n**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.\n\n**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.\n\n**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.\n\n**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.\n\n**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> There will be basically a member space and a public space.\n\n**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.\n\n**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.\n\n**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.\n\n**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.\n\n**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I will also say that once we have a directory.\n\n**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We're going to start encouraging members to become.\n\n**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.\n\n**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.\n\n**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.\n\n**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.\n\n**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.\n\n**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.\n\n**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> It's 10.56.\n\n**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> I have no other items that I really want to get to.\n\n**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Okay.\n\n**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you everybody.\n\n**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thanks for being here.\n\n**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)\n> Thank you, John.\n\n---\n---\n---",
