  Yes, sir.

  Perfect. That's strange. Just when I start, it works. Okay. I'm going to turn this off. on a second. Okay, so I'm going to move this.  So, yeah, so the book is a documentary of the kind of the scientific movement and the eco movement to restore the land and in order to bring back the rain.  And so that's kind of the main focus. But then there's also this other even deeper focus. There's this. Which is that the Earth is kind of a self-organizing, self-regulating system that is kind of using the water cycle to regulate temperature and also to regulate its rain.  And that's kind of the work that Anastasia and Victor Gorshkov were doing. And so there's actually a chapter on Victor and Anastasia, and Anastasia was nice enough to review it.  So that was nice. So, yeah, so a little bit about my background. I was a, I was in, I was a graduate student in physics, and then I kind of moved into the kind of the, over the years, I actually ended up in the kind of eco world and permaculture world.  And so I got really interested in, and I was in California at the time, and we were having all these wildfires every year.  And I was like, it seems like the only solution people are proposing is to chop down more trees. And, um, and so, um, and  What I came across is Zach Weiss's work was saying you can restore the water, small water cycle, and also hydrate the land.  so there's a whole new approach to dealing with these wildfires, which was devastating California that no one was really looking at, it seems.  And then I read Charles Eisenstein's book, Climate, and he was saying that the water is maybe even more important than carbon, because it's a self-organizing system.  It's like, how Earth, you know, regulates itself. And so I kind of got into this field, and I started organizing the Water Restoration Alliance.  And after a little while, the Eco Restoration Alliance was birthing, too. And so we had a bit of synergy.  And we were organizing all these people like Michael Kravitch and Brock Dolman and others, and so kind of bringing their awareness.  And then I started writing my substack newsletter, the Climate Water Project, and then started hosting a podcast after Judith Schwartz introduced me to Milan Milan.  And so then I started getting a lot of attention. And And And And And And And And And And  And because I was a bit concerned that I didn't know if all these permaculture people and eco people were right saying that the trees can create the rain and coming from a physics background, I wanted more rigorous science.  So that's why I went back to academia. So now I'm actually doing research on water and, and, and, you know, and one of the things I discovered was that there's a whole disconnect between the scientists and the eco people.  And at first there was felt like it was just a couple of people doing this science of land use affecting rain.  But as I looked down more, it's like more and more, it's like hundreds of scientists. And then I talked to the scientists and they want to get their work out more.  They had no idea, they would call it precipitation recycling, that there was all this whole eco crowd called small water cycle.  And basically in academia, you you can have 10 people or 20 people read your paper that you slogged over for a year, you know, and it's important work.  And so, you know, there's people very frustrated on the scientists side that discovered all this stuff, but they're not getting out to the eco people.  there's reposta, will happen. There People are like, oh, how come no scientists are looking at this? And, and so, you know, part of my work, and especially now that I'm academia, is I want to bring back, you know, bring a kind of connection of these two, two groups that aren't really talking to each other.  And that's my hope with this book. So yeah, so for instance, like, you know, Suyuko Manabe, who won the Nobel Prize for his work on, you know, he basically birthed the whole carbon greenhouse movement by showing that water vapor is part of that site.  And he won the Nobel Prize. But he was basically the first scientist that included the soil in the climate models, because he was the early developer in the 60s, and 70s.  And so he already put the soil in and the rain would come down. And if he had that, it would actually go back up and, you know, affect the rain.  And, and then he, you know, in Jules Chani, he, he's probably the most important person in the climate movement, because he, he birthed the Chani report in 1979.  And it kind of kickstarted the whole action around the greenhouse movement. And he used the model and he showed that the Sahara, you know, the trees were creating the rain.  And so these are the two, probably two of the three or four most central people in the climate movement also doing work, showing how land use affects the climate through the water cycle.  And then Chani had a student called Jagadish Shukla, this Indian guy, and he kind of took Chani's work further.  And he said, OK, what happens when we pave over the world? And so when he paved over the world in his models, he found that, oh, the rain reduced by half.  And he says, oh, my God, this is so important. Everyone's just looking at the oceans and as it's a creative rain, we need to create the land.  And so he actually birthed this institute. He was at NASA and he said, everyone's being siloed. So he put together an institute, land, you know, the Center for Ocean Land Atmosphere, because he said.  You need to take into account all three, and so that institute actually birthed all these soil rain programs and all sorts of projects that take multiple countries and, you know, and start developing all these models, and so there's this whole field, you know, this whole section of scientists that, you know, kind of like a lineage of scientists that are looking at this, and I don't think most of the eco people are aware of it, and I'm not sure all those people that Schuller birthed and these whole institutes and multiple projects and involving NASA, realize all the work the restoration people doing, because you can slow water and all the permaculture things like swales and terraces that slow the water, and what they need to be doing is putting this into their models, and if you do this at large scale, or restore the soil so it can absorb more rain, how does it affect their models?  And so that's kind of, I think, one of the things that needs to be done. And, you know, and science works by a lot of lineages, and so there'll be multiple lineages in this whole land atmosphere, of decoupling.  And so that's one lineage. And then this whole lineage with Ines Salati, he was the first person that probably proved that forests were creating rain by following the stable isotopes in Brazil in 1979.  And then he brought on Carlos Nobre, who I think his brother brought Anastasia to South America and kind of got that idea of the biotic pump going, or the work that birthed that.  And so there's that whole lineage there. And so Amazon has become kind of like the fruit fly of precipitation.  They call it precipitation recycle, not the small water cycle in the in the scientist world. But so there's been, you know, hundreds of scientists, you know, go, you know, kind of do their models on Amazon, because they realize that the Amazon is producing the rain for the, you know, the southern countries beneath it.  And so because the wind blows it. And so, so I think that's the place where it's actually I entered into government policy the most is that the governments there actually recognize that the trees are creating the rain, I don't hasn't propagated elsewhere as much.  And then there's a whole another lineage like who puts seven AJ is a Dutch hydrologist, and he was in Africa, and he just by studying, he was seeing that the rain didn't decrease, you know, as it was further in the African continent.  So he said, Oh, that must be the only way it can do that is if there's rain is right, the evaporation is rising from the land to create more rain.  And I think that's the same way Anastasia and Viktor Gorshkov figured out that the rain was doing too, because they tracked all these different, they compared the forests, which weren't decreasing rain as well inside the continent, a desert layer is where it was.  And so he used the same reasoning that Anastasia had come up with. And so he's birthed a whole lineage like Ruud van der Ent, who then mapped out the whole small water cycle, and how different places in the world of evaporation would come be  And so, for instance, like the Congo, you know, just like the Amazon supplying rain for the rest of South America, the Congo is for a lot of Africa, and then in Europe will blow over to Asia, and they're supplying the rain for China.  And anyway, so it's really fascinating. And this, you know, it's kind of an important thing. And, you know, important, I think it's an important map that should be a lot more famous.  And I interviewed him on my podcast. And then he has a lot of collaborators, like Lang Wang Erdladsen, who is now in talks with the FAO, which is the United Nations Agriculture, who have now recognized that, you know, the agriculture systems are in danger, because they're not getting enough water.  And so we need to bring back the rain. And so, so there are, there are preliminary talks, like, because she does all this precipitation recycling research, and so they're getting it into the FAO.  And so, you know, at the higher levels, the United Nations, there's various entities that are interested in this, but it's still it's still in there's  And to get the science correct before they implement it. So they haven't implemented the programs, but the discussions are happening.  And, you know, a lot of these precipitation recycling scientists are also, you know, crafting treaty things. Like we have river treaties between different countries, but they're starting to do the treaties between countries about the rain because your land use affects my rain, you know, and so they're kind of doing the legwork for that.  But, you know, that's still very early stages before it actually gets... You know, gets more traction, I think. And then Pat Keyes is also part of that lineage, who also will be...  All these three I'll be releasing the podcast. I just interviewed him... Oh, actually, today. And yes, he was at the Stockholm Resilience Centre doing all this work.  And he tracked the cities. And so there's certain cities that if they restore their land near their cities will bring back a lot more of their rain.  So he mapped out which are the key cities that... You know, that, that could do more restoration work to bring back their rain.  So those are three lineages. And then there's this whole lineage around teleconnections where, you know, like Abigail Swan at, you know, is showing how, you know, chop down forests in one country, it affects the rain in another country.  And so there's all these other teleconnections because basically the Hadley cell and the Feral cell there, I don't know if you know what they are, but basically there's this big atmospheric conveyor belts.  They go up in the end and come back down. So in the equator, they go up and then come back down in the mid latitudes.  And so the forests in Indonesia will drive those Hadley cells. And, and these, and so the forests are driving these Hadley cells.  And if you cut down forests, they, they don't cycle as much. And the Hadley cells and the Feral cells are actually driving the jet streams.  And the jet streams are, when they get blocked, they actually cause climate whiplash. So you get snows in Texas or, you know, crazy weather.  So this climate whiplash where we're oscillating between more droughts and more storms has to, you know, people, I think very few people realize this, but there's research being done showing how this is related to the chopping down of vegetation.  Um, so there's that whole, so this is a whole nother aspect, um, of the, of the, of the whole system.  So, um, so basically the framework is we, we've actually beginning to have to understand the earth as like a circulatory system.  So just say your blood, if you're circulating not very well and you want more blood say in your arm or something, you may need to repair your leg, which is bleeding or your kidney or whatever it is that's filtering the blood or, you know, it's not natural.  Especially if you're missing the rain in, in, in Zimbabwe, you might have to do work in Alaska. You know, it's like.  Yeah. But we don't have that understanding yet, and that's the other part of the book is like the people are looking at more the integral theory, integral theory, you know, integral systems of the water cycle, like the biolic regulation of Anastasia and Gorshkov or the Gaia theory, is that we need these geophysiological systems, and this is where we need to kind of advance it.  And I've been doing work along that, it's not in the book, but kind of seeing how the vegetation and animals is forming the metabolic system, metabolic system, and that drives a circulatory system of the earth, and there's these feedback loops, and then there's this hormonal system that's actually guiding this circulatory system.  So the microbes that you send into the air, they're possibly sending signals, just like your hormones guide when you pump blood more, what you do with the blood, and so there's this intimate connection, because you were discussing how do we tell this story of how they all integrated.  So this is what I'm thinking about. There's this metabolic system, this hormonal system, this circulatory system. And we really need to understand climate.  I think climate's going to become a subset of biology because we have to look at it more from these organismal terms because basically our climate models, the things don't adapt and adjust enough.  So the trees are not changing their behavior. They're not learning from the clouds. But really that's how, at deeper level, the whole system's working.  And so that's why I think we need to move to a biological model. And once we start figuring out, you know, how these whole systems, metabolic, the immune, the hormonal, the circular system, there's a much deeper analogy than just kind of hand-waving stuff.  And basically we have these huge heart pumps too, like for the earth. So the Amazon, the Congo, the Russian boreal forest, Canadian boreal forest, and the Indonesian rainforest.  These are the five massive pumps, and maybe the US one too, six massive pumps that are pumping this whole circulatory system.  So you mess... I with one of them, the whole earth is going to mess up there. It's not just locally, it's like the whole thing, and we've got to kind of understand this.  And so we've got to kind of move towards this kind of Marshall Plan of understanding this large circulatory system of the earth.  And it's basically, we're doing plumbing maintenance, because that's distributing all the water for our cities and our farms and everything.  And so this is the work that I think we need to bring the scientists and the eco people together.  And that's the other part of the book is that I'm documenting all the people doing all the eco work from Michael Kravkich to Walter Jenny to all the soil people because they're important.  You know, Zach Weiss, the Sponge City thing, the Pani Cup in India. So all these massive and then whole Greek Green War in Africa.  So all these projects are shifting the water template. And so that's then going to drive all this circulatory system.  And that's where the connection has to because all these. I with one of them, the whole earth is going to mess up there.  It's not just locally, it's like the whole thing, and we've got to kind of understand this. And so we've got to kind of move towards this kind of Marshall Plan of understanding this large circulatory system of the earth.  And it's basically, we're doing plumbing maintenance, because that's distributing all the water for our cities and our farms and everything.  And so this is the work that I think we need to bring the scientists and the eco people together.  And that's the other part of the book is that I'm documenting all the people doing all the eco work from Michael Kravkich to Walter Jenny to all the soil people because they're important.
