**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:00] Cory Albers**
> to happen that cleanses the water and ultimately produces something of use for the community.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:37:52] Cory Albers**
> Just for perspective the last flagship project that I showed you with the videos looping was only a six

**[00:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> to hack our site.

**[00:38:01] Cory Albers**
> So the one we're proposing here is 36 hectares, so it's six times the size of the one that you saw few moments ago.

**[00:38:11] Cory Albers**
> And therefore, it's an environment in which we can create these incredibly beautiful places.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**
> these are some conceptual examples that we've created, just to indicate the the type of space that we expect to be able to create, the look and feel in this particular location.

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**
> recreation, and true connection between human beings can happen in these spaces.

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

**[00:39:25] Cory Albers**
> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**
> It's not a building where worship happens.

**[00:39:33] Cory Albers**
> It's an environment where the worship can be enhanced.

**[00:39:42] Cory Albers**
> And I'll just leave it here.

**[00:39:44] Cory Albers**
> There's obviously plenty of things that we could continue talking about, but this was one of my favorite photos we took on the trip of myself on the

**[00:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> the three wise travelers.

**[00:40:02] Cory Albers**
> So I'm honored to have had the opportunity to speak to you today.

**[00:40:07] Cory Albers**
> Thank you so much.

**[00:40:08] Cory Albers**
> And I think we'll just turn it back to you, John here.

**[00:40:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Absolutely.

**[00:40:14] Michael Mayer**
> I'm just going to wrap things up little bit here.

**[00:40:18] Michael Mayer**
> The scope of the project in state and in Nugu State are really quite different.

**[00:40:26] Michael Mayer**
> And between them, there is a hybrid model that is evolving.

**[00:41:16] Michael Mayer**
> Obviously a massive project and what we're doing is staging it over time to be able to get all of the stakeholders in Indigenous traditional right up through local and even national government with international partners as a way to model what can happen when everyone gets together both at the community level and more broadly to make a sustainable step of both supporting climate initiatives and quality of life.

**[00:41:46] Michael Mayer**
> Again, this is not about the money today but just to invite all of you to become aware of what's happening and over time there will be a crowdsourcing initiative for some of the creative

**[00:42:05] Michael Mayer**
> So thank you.

**[00:42:06] Michael Mayer**
> It's a wonderful growing movement that we have in growing community.

**[00:42:10] Michael Mayer**
> We're building, and ERA is certainly a wonderful part of that on our behalf.

**[00:42:15] Michael Mayer**
> So thank you for listening, and John, do we have time for a few Q and A's if casual allows?

**[00:42:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Absolutely.

**[00:42:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Questions or comments?

**[00:42:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to, while you're coming up with your own questions or comments, I'm going to share my screen for a moment.

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just been thinking about how the heck did this come about, and it's sort of an interesting case of networking and about the ERA, for what it's worth.

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And our paths and experiential education, John and Jake and I, what I'm trying to say, we're involved with the Eco Restoration Alliance that then the work that Mara had been doing in Buffalo converged in this effort in a new go, which was co-sponsored by the Eco Restoration Alliance, that has led to this experiential education program that Sami has told us about, which is really very exciting, the notion that there's now apparently a commitment to one hectare of land for each of 250 schools that's going to have an experiential ecological regenerative education program built into it, is a huge victory and contribution.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very, can be very excited to see how that develops.

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that, of course, has led to partly from a trip that Jake and the

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe, Konkanko and Sanmi took to Nigeria, the elevation of water as a major topic of concern, as well as an objective study, led to source-to-source, developing as a venture in both Inugu and in oil province.

**[00:44:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as we've seen from those incredible pictures by Corey, there's a huge amount of ecological learning and ecological regeneration to be done in pulling together this initiative.

**[00:44:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So each of these stories is unique, but it's really very interesting and exciting to see how all these connections, and I'm sure I left them any out, are converging.

**[00:44:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you for the update.

**[00:44:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:45:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie Rios Duran is here also, who is our project manager in Panama and introduced herself last week to that end.

**[00:45:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the essence of that project is to try to find a way to restore the Panama watershed and its moisture sources in order to refill the pesky Panama canal, saving the world economy up to $50 billion a year.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And, of course, focus the world's attention on what really matters, namely ecological regeneration.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A piece of that puzzle is going to be to figure out how to mobilize finance as well as the population to figure out what they really need, what they really want, what they really know how to do, and work with them to come up with the kind of water solution that they really In that connection, we, the ERA, has allies in the group of ecological Sierra Gorda in Mexico, who showed up, I think, at our very first town hall meeting, and have done wonderful work in the last two to three years that we've been here.

**[00:46:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They're going to update on that and set the stage, I hope, for collaborating with us to use their local Latin American roundup.

**[00:47:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So with that as a segue and an introduction, I will introduce the team from Gruco, Gruco Ecological Sierra Gordo and invite them to remind me that I guess it's Laura who will pick off.

**[00:47:23] Alex Carlin**
> Is that right?

**[00:47:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I saw Laura here up until the moment when I mentioned her name.

**[00:47:47] Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda I.A.P.**
> So, I'm going to third my collection as well.

**[00:47:57] Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda I.A.P.**
> All right.

**[00:47:57] Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda I.A.P.**
> everyone, I'm Sierra Gordo back.

**[00:48:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Hello, Lara.

**[00:48:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, I believe that we have three guests today, Lara, Roberto Pedroza from Wildlands Conservation, who's going to give us some background, Ross from the Biodiversity Carbon Team, which has developed a really interesting governmental and subnational governance methodology, and Alex Watson from Open Forests, who's going to talk about traceability and effectiveness.

**[00:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have to leave it to the aforementioned to decide who's going to present next, because I don't know.

**[00:48:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Beto, Roberto Pedroza will be the first to speak.

**[00:48:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right then.

**[00:48:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Hi, John.

**[00:48:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Hi, everybody.

**[00:48:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> morning in Mexico.

**[00:48:54] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for this space.

**[00:48:57] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I'm going to share our experience since you got to go to that fine

**[00:49:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to change the additional activities.

**[00:49:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In our case, agricultural and cow ranching have led forest barns, landslides, dry creeks, forest fires, and poverty.

**[00:49:14] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So what to keep doing the same?

**[00:49:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin years ago to try to convert CO2 as a conservation asset for local communities and forest owners, because every piece of these mountains has a local owner and without another income, they will keep slashing and burning the forest and stay poor.

**[00:49:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin the calculation, the methodology, I work for the group, because here at Gordon, I'm in church of a network of private nature reserves within this mountains landscape and also a wildlife photographer.

**[00:49:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> the images you are going to see here are part of the beneficiaries.

**[00:49:55] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That's why we call our product carbonobe reversal.

**[00:49:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> To develop this

**[00:50:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It is key to have different partners at the world and trust, based in the UK, which is supporting two different carbon projects and the greater state governments through the Sadesu or Secretariat, Sabrei, Sustin, Tablei.

**[00:50:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So that green area is where the Sierra Gordon is based, of the Eastern Sierra Madre, is the most eco diverse protected area, because it's a advisory reserve, and remember that San Mexico is one of the top 10 mega diverse countries in the world, so it's really piece of cake this mountains and by a local diversity day, the carbo.

**[00:50:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It covers almost a million acres from desert to temperate forest, cloud forest, tropical forest, riparian forest, so a little piece of Mexico is comprised in these mountains.

**[00:50:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We're fighting carbo-ranching, carbo-cave here in the 16th century, and it's an exotic wildlife, I mean not wildlife, but found animals.

**[00:51:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> not be roaming Mexican forests.

**[00:51:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's the difference between one protected without cattle and the right side, one overgraced without junk trees or understory, eliminating a whole layer of the forest and damaging biodiversity.

**[00:51:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And planting corn in these mountains is nonsense because their bare-steep slopes, they best more work and money than actually crops, they're getting and not even self-sufficient.

**[00:51:30] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we need to give value and the real income to local forest owners to change that evil scheme.

**[00:51:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So with the world and trust, we develop a first project.

**[00:51:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Based on our local calculations of how much carbon is storing the forest and how much increases removing cattle and chainsaws.

**[00:51:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Also logging has done a lot of damage to these best trees are gone, but still a very nice forest.

**[00:51:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So in hilly plants,

**[00:52:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's a list of the sea, on the east side of the Sierra Gorda, we're working with four different Hidos, which are coming up properly.

**[00:52:06] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Almost 5,000 hectares of forest were no more land clearance, no logging, and no use of fire.

**[00:52:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that force really, a piece of cake, and these friends are respecting the view, and the force is doing great.

**[00:52:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And then within the Sierra Gorda, additional work with 26 private owners, one Hido, protecting 2,500 hectares between the nature reserves.

**[00:52:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In green are the private nature reserves, we're protecting mostly cloud forest.

**[00:52:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Why cloud forest?

**[00:52:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> cloud forest is covered less than 1% in Mexico.

**[00:52:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They covered 12% of the explorer, and 33% is endemic.

**[00:52:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you want to make great conservation and that conversation you have to take.

**[00:53:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to take care of the cloud forest.

**[00:53:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in JLO, the properties involved in these payments of carbon and remember no more cattle or chasels or forest fires.

**[00:53:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in blue, the commercial property outside the state of getting cattle.

**[00:53:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this pretty several as sorry, about the payments that are done every six months.

**[00:53:24] robertopedrazaruiz**
> People is getting 100% of their money for the carbon, not a small percentage with a carbon brokers and developers and all those pirates.

**[00:53:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And payments are done a very public way.

**[00:53:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They received a check in front of their fellow landowners.

**[00:53:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They can use the money they've decided themselves have to use their resources.

**[00:53:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We don't conditionate, you have to spend the money on this and this and this.

**[00:53:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> what is the main concern here?

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And part of this project is a wild land fire management.

**[00:54:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I grew up planting trees, now it's not possible longer.

**[00:54:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Longer possible because of the drought.

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Spring is the worst season in Mexico because of the latitude.

**[00:54:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It brings the drought, heat waves and the forest fires.

**[00:54:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> in a tree plant, firefighter tells the whole story about climate change, how real it is, it's changing our landscape and way of living.

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Then we set up a character of the two projects of the world and was worked as a reference, and it took

**[00:55:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Because three governors to make this really happen.

**[00:55:04] robertopedrazaruiz**
> 12 years ago, it was just a small tax on the vehicles.

**[00:55:12] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In 2020, the price of the world on tonscare served as an example.

**[00:55:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> finally, two years ago, the Canada State Congress approved a new law.

**[00:55:23] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Saudi industry basically my state have to pay carbon tax.

**[00:55:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a self-financing mechanism.

**[00:55:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's paying who is making the dirty business.

**[00:55:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And the funding is coming to share a order to pay first owners to offset the carbon emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**
> We've been doing this for a couple years now.

**[01:00:51] Alex Carlin**
> We did four countries where we did concerts and press conferences We did a cookie bar Ghana Togo and Benine.

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**
> best in Africa, I think, from Abi-John.

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's take a deep breath.

**[01:27:56] sustainavistas**
> Grant?

**[01:27:57] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, hi, guys.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Sorry.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Thanks very much.

**[01:28:00] sustainavistas**
> inspiring.

**[01:28:01] sustainavistas**
> I have to say goodbye.

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**
> So when till we're going to have something and in the

**[01:29:00] sustainavistas**
> some of this is going to be an incredible party and things to celebrate in Amsterdam next year.

**[01:29:03] sustainavistas**
> So put that in your agenda, guys.

**[01:29:05] sustainavistas**
> And once again, thank you very much.

**[01:29:08] sustainavistas**
> And goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant is coming fairly close to volunteering to chair our public events committee.

**[01:29:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we'll have to follow up on that.

**[01:29:22] sustainavistas**
> When there's a band, is banned, I love it.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> His email is in the chat.

**[01:29:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm serious.

**[01:29:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Someone needs to start pulling this together.

**[01:29:32] sustainavistas**
> Bye everyone.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cheers guys.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have a good one.

**[01:29:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob has asked for as much time as he can possibly have to prepare his presentation.

**[01:29:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see his lips are moving as if he's he's he's preparing.

**[01:29:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to say let's take a few minutes and just introduce ourselves if we haven't already.

**[01:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My top row, everyone has been introduced.

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Look at that.

**[01:30:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ananda, would you like to say hello?

**[01:30:09] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Hi, everyone.

**[01:30:11] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> We did an old spiel here or just hi, everyone.

**[01:30:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Just hello and who you are so that people want to get in touch with the chair of the steering committee or our new vice president or Ananda, the author of several books on water, they know how to associate your face with your name.

**[01:30:32] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> How's that?

**[01:30:33] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> All right.

**[01:30:34] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Thank you for doing all that for me, John.

**[01:30:39] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Philip.

**[01:30:50] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I heard my name.

**[01:30:52] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I have a back and president of the board of biographical climate and former in crime and other creative projects with

**[01:31:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> John on many many other things.

**[01:31:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:31:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And a member of our board as is Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:11] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> Yeah, I'm Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:13] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> I'm I'm an ecological economist who works with biophor climate and I am, as John said, a member of the ERA Board and could might be to be involved with this organization.

**[01:31:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Russ Spear, who brought us, Alex Carlin and our musical interlude, say hello.

**[01:31:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Or not.

**[01:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Marius.

**[01:31:47] Russ Speer**
> Hello.

**[01:31:49] Russ Speer**
> Hi, sorry.

**[01:31:50] Russ Speer**
> I was pushing a bunch of buttons there.

**[01:31:52] Russ Speer**
> I just I just passed the invitation to come to Amsterdam on to Alex and his band.

**[01:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So wonderful.

**[01:32:01] Russ Speer**
> I mean, this is so amazing.

**[01:32:03] Russ Speer**
> All the different reports on the different projects.

**[01:32:07] Russ Speer**
> I think we got climate change, excuse me, not climate change, global warming on the run.

**[01:32:15] Russ Speer**
> There are actually several companies full, all of whom make great returns on the investment, and all of them who bring down huge amounts of carbon and mostly turn it into repurpose it into living carbon.

**[01:32:33] Russ Speer**
> Which, of course, we get enough living carbon off, things start cooling off, gets reasonable again.

**[01:32:41] Russ Speer**
> So lots of reasons for optimism.

**[01:32:44] Russ Speer**
> I should probably give a presentation in about a month or two.

**[01:32:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I look forward to that, Russ.

**[01:32:50] Russ Speer**
> Thank you.

**[01:32:51] Russ Speer**
> So find the next victim.

**[01:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:32:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Arias, that would be you from Uganda.

**[01:32:57] Russ Speer**
> Are you with us?

**[01:33:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then it will be sending and then it will be with you see him.

**[01:33:06] Ir Marius**
> Hello, Marius.

**[01:33:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:33:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Nice to hear your voice.

**[01:33:18] Ir Marius**

**[01:33:30] Cindy Eiritz**
> I appreciate listening to this amazing, amazing stuff.

**[01:33:35] Cindy Eiritz**
> It's so inspiring and so uplifting.

**[01:33:37] Cindy Eiritz**

> Yes, yes.

**[00:11:07] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:11:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:00] Cory Albers**
> to happen that cleanses the water and ultimately produces something of use for the community.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:37:52] Cory Albers**
> Just for perspective the last flagship project that I showed you with the videos looping was only a six

**[00:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> to hack our site.

**[00:38:01] Cory Albers**
> So the one we're proposing here is 36 hectares, so it's six times the size of the one that you saw few moments ago.

**[00:38:11] Cory Albers**
> And therefore, it's an environment in which we can create these incredibly beautiful places.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**
> these are some conceptual examples that we've created, just to indicate the the type of space that we expect to be able to create, the look and feel in this particular location.

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**
> recreation, and true connection between human beings can happen in these spaces.

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

**[00:39:25] Cory Albers**
> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**
> It's not a building where worship happens.

**[00:39:33] Cory Albers**
> It's an environment where the worship can be enhanced.

**[00:39:42] Cory Albers**
> And I'll just leave it here.

**[00:39:44] Cory Albers**
> There's obviously plenty of things that we could continue talking about, but this was one of my favorite photos we took on the trip of myself on the

**[00:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:40:02] Cory Albers**
> So I'm honored to have had the opportunity to speak to you today.

**[00:40:07] Cory Albers**
> Thank you so much.

**[00:40:08] Cory Albers**
> And I think we'll just turn it back to you, John here.

**[00:40:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Absolutely.

**[00:40:14] Michael Mayer**
> I'm just going to wrap things up little bit here.

**[00:40:18] Michael Mayer**
> The scope of the project in state and in Nugu State are really quite different.

**[00:40:26] Michael Mayer**
> And between them, there is a hybrid model that is evolving.

**[00:41:16] Michael Mayer**
> Obviously a massive project and what we're doing is staging it over time to be able to get all of the stakeholders in Indigenous traditional right up through local and even national government with international partners as a way to model what can happen when everyone gets together both at the community level and more broadly to make a sustainable step of both supporting climate initiatives and quality of life.

**[00:41:46] Michael Mayer**

**[00:42:06] Michael Mayer**
> It's a wonderful growing movement that we have in growing community.

**[00:42:10] Michael Mayer**
> We're building, and ERA is certainly a wonderful part of that on our behalf.

**[00:42:15] Michael Mayer**
> So thank you for listening, and John, do we have time for a few Q and A's if casual allows?

**[00:42:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Absolutely.

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just been thinking about how the heck did this come about, and it's sort of an interesting case of networking and about the ERA, for what it's worth.

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And our paths and experiential education, John and Jake and I, what I'm trying to say, we're involved with the Eco Restoration Alliance that then the work that Mara had been doing in Buffalo converged in this effort in a new go, which was co-sponsored by the Eco Restoration Alliance, that has led to this experiential education program that Sami has told us about, which is really very exciting, the notion that there's now apparently a commitment to one hectare of land for each of 250 schools that's going to have an experiential ecological regenerative education program built into it, is a huge victory and contribution.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very, can be very excited to see how that develops.

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as we've seen from those incredible pictures by Corey, there's a huge amount of ecological learning and ecological regeneration to be done in pulling together this initiative.

**[00:44:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So each of these stories is unique, but it's really very interesting and exciting to see how all these connections, and I'm sure I left them any out, are converging.

**[00:44:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:50:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It is key to have different partners at the world and trust, based in the UK, which is supporting two different carbon projects and the greater state governments through the Sadesu or Secretariat, Sabrei, Sustin, Tablei.

**[00:50:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So that green area is where the Sierra Gordon is based, of the Eastern Sierra Madre, is the most eco diverse protected area, because it's a advisory reserve, and remember that San Mexico is one of the top 10 mega diverse countries in the world, so it's really piece of cake this mountains and by a local diversity day, the carbo.

**[00:50:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It covers almost a million acres from desert to temperate forest, cloud forest, tropical forest, riparian forest, so a little piece of Mexico is comprised in these mountains.

**[00:50:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We're fighting carbo-ranching, carbo-cave here in the 16th century, and it's an exotic wildlife, I mean not wildlife, but found animals.

**[00:51:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> not be roaming Mexican forests.

**[00:51:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's the difference between one protected without cattle and the right side, one overgraced without junk trees or understory, eliminating a whole layer of the forest and damaging biodiversity.

**[00:51:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And planting corn in these mountains is nonsense because their bare-steep slopes, they best more work and money than actually crops, they're getting and not even self-sufficient.

**[00:51:30] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we need to give value and the real income to local forest owners to change that evil scheme.

**[00:51:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So with the world and trust, we develop a first project.

**[00:51:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Based on our local calculations of how much carbon is storing the forest and how much increases removing cattle and chainsaws.

**[00:51:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Also logging has done a lot of damage to these best trees are gone, but still a very nice forest.

**[00:51:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So in hilly plants,

**[00:52:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's a list of the sea, on the east side of the Sierra Gorda, we're working with four different Hidos, which are coming up properly.

**[00:52:06] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Almost 5,000 hectares of forest were no more land clearance, no logging, and no use of fire.

**[00:52:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that force really, a piece of cake, and these friends are respecting the view, and the force is doing great.

**[00:52:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And then within the Sierra Gorda, additional work with 26 private owners, one Hido, protecting 2,500 hectares between the nature reserves.

**[00:52:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In green are the private nature reserves, we're protecting mostly cloud forest.

**[00:52:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Why cloud forest?

**[00:52:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> cloud forest is covered less than 1% in Mexico.

**[00:52:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They covered 12% of the explorer, and 33% is endemic.

**[00:52:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you want to make great conservation and that conversation you have to take.

**[00:53:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to take care of the cloud forest.

**[00:53:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in JLO, the properties involved in these payments of carbon and remember no more cattle or chasels or forest fires.

**[00:53:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in blue, the commercial property outside the state of getting cattle.

**[00:53:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this pretty several as sorry, about the payments that are done every six months.

**[00:53:24] robertopedrazaruiz**
> People is getting 100% of their money for the carbon, not a small percentage with a carbon brokers and developers and all those pirates.

**[00:53:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And payments are done a very public way.

**[00:53:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They received a check in front of their fellow landowners.

**[00:53:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They can use the money they've decided themselves have to use their resources.

**[00:53:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We don't conditionate, you have to spend the money on this and this and this.

**[00:53:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> what is the main concern here?

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And part of this project is a wild land fire management.

**[00:54:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I grew up planting trees, now it's not possible longer.

**[00:54:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Longer possible because of the drought.

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Spring is the worst season in Mexico because of the latitude.

**[00:54:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It brings the drought, heat waves and the forest fires.

**[00:54:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> in a tree plant, firefighter tells the whole story about climate change, how real it is, it's changing our landscape and way of living.

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Then we set up a character of the two projects of the world and was worked as a reference, and it took

**[00:55:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Because three governors to make this really happen.

**[00:55:04] robertopedrazaruiz**
> 12 years ago, it was just a small tax on the vehicles.

**[00:55:12] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In 2020, the price of the world on tonscare served as an example.

**[00:55:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> finally, two years ago, the Canada State Congress approved a new law.

**[00:55:23] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Saudi industry basically my state have to pay carbon tax.

**[00:55:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a self-financing mechanism.

**[00:55:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's paying who is making the dirty business.

**[00:55:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And the funding is coming to share a order to pay first owners to offset the carbon emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**
> We've been doing this for a couple years now.

**[01:00:51] Alex Carlin**
> We did four countries where we did concerts and press conferences We did a cookie bar Ghana Togo and Benine.

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**
> best in Africa, I think, from Abi-John.

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's take a deep breath.

**[01:27:56] sustainavistas**
> Grant?

**[01:27:57] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, hi, guys.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Sorry.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Thanks very much.

**[01:28:00] sustainavistas**
> inspiring.

**[01:28:01] sustainavistas**
> I have to say goodbye.

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**
> So when till we're going to have something and in the

**[01:29:00] sustainavistas**
> some of this is going to be an incredible party and things to celebrate in Amsterdam next year.

**[01:29:03] sustainavistas**
> So put that in your agenda, guys.

**[01:29:05] sustainavistas**
> And once again, thank you very much.

**[01:29:08] sustainavistas**
> And goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant is coming fairly close to volunteering to chair our public events committee.

**[01:29:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we'll have to follow up on that.

**[01:29:22] sustainavistas**
> When there's a band, is banned, I love it.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> His email is in the chat.

**[01:29:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm serious.

**[01:29:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Someone needs to start pulling this together.

**[01:29:32] sustainavistas**
> Bye everyone.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cheers guys.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:29:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob has asked for as much time as he can possibly have to prepare his presentation.

**[01:29:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see his lips are moving as if he's he's he's preparing.

**[01:29:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to say let's take a few minutes and just introduce ourselves if we haven't already.

**[01:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My top row, everyone has been introduced.

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Look at that.

**[01:30:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ananda, would you like to say hello?

**[01:30:09] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Hi, everyone.

**[01:30:11] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> We did an old spiel here or just hi, everyone.

**[01:30:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Just hello and who you are so that people want to get in touch with the chair of the steering committee or our new vice president or Ananda, the author of several books on water, they know how to associate your face with your name.

**[01:30:32] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> How's that?

**[01:30:33] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> All right.

**[01:30:34] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Thank you for doing all that for me, John.

**[01:30:39] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Philip.

**[01:30:50] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I heard my name.

**[01:30:52] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I have a back and president of the board of biographical climate and former in crime and other creative projects with

**[01:31:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> John on many many other things.

**[01:31:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:31:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And a member of our board as is Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:11] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> Yeah, I'm Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:13] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> I'm I'm an ecological economist who works with biophor climate and I am, as John said, a member of the ERA Board and could might be to be involved with this organization.

**[01:31:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Russ Spear, who brought us, Alex Carlin and our musical interlude, say hello.

**[01:31:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Or not.

**[01:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Marius.

**[01:31:47] Russ Speer**
> Hello.

**[01:31:49] Russ Speer**
> Hi, sorry.

**[01:31:50] Russ Speer**
> I was pushing a bunch of buttons there.

**[01:31:52] Russ Speer**
> I just I just passed the invitation to come to Amsterdam on to Alex and his band.

**[01:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So wonderful.

**[01:32:01] Russ Speer**
> I mean, this is so amazing.

**[01:32:03] Russ Speer**
> All the different reports on the different projects.

**[01:32:07] Russ Speer**
> I think we got climate change, excuse me, not climate change, global warming on the run.

**[01:32:15] Russ Speer**
> There are actually several companies full, all of whom make great returns on the investment, and all of them who bring down huge amounts of carbon and mostly turn it into repurpose it into living carbon.

**[01:32:33] Russ Speer**
> Which, of course, we get enough living carbon off, things start cooling off, gets reasonable again.

**[01:32:41] Russ Speer**
> So lots of reasons for optimism.

**[01:32:44] Russ Speer**
> I should probably give a presentation in about a month or two.

**[01:32:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I look forward to that, Russ.

**[01:32:50] Russ Speer**
> Thank you.

**[01:32:51] Russ Speer**
> So find the next victim.

**[01:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:32:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Arias, that would be you from Uganda.

**[01:32:57] Russ Speer**
> Are you with us?

**[01:33:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then it will be sending and then it will be with you see him.

**[01:33:06] Ir Marius**

### Mention 3: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 86068:*
```
**[00:00:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes.

**[00:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> I'm trying to check.

**[00:00:06] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, good.

**[00:00:06] Alex Carlin**
> hear you fine.

**[00:00:07] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, Russ Spear and me to this meeting.

**[00:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> Happy to be here.

**[00:00:13] Alex Carlin**
> I'm doing a lot of things in And in fact, I do want to mention while we have a second that I have a super important meeting about what we're doing in Ghana coming up in early August.

**[00:00:28] Alex Carlin**
> So I can, I'm really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:32] Alex Carlin**
> I only have about 30, 40 minutes before I have to get ready for that meeting.

**[00:00:37] Alex Carlin**
> So I just want to mention that up top that I might, I'm not being rude if I leave, I have to do something else.

**[00:00:44] Alex Carlin**
> But I'm really, really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:47] Alex Carlin**
> And if there's any chance to be super briefly about what my project is, that would be wonderful as well.

**[00:00:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, well, we'll begin with a brief round of introductions, just a sentence.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> or two.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But then we'll ask you back to give us a presentation, if you like.

**[00:01:04] Alex Carlin**
> Well, that would be fantastic.

**[00:01:06] Alex Carlin**
> You mean a different day?

**[00:01:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:01:08] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, that'd be wonderful.

**[00:01:09] Alex Carlin**
> That'd be perfect.

**[00:01:10] Alex Carlin**
> Then I won't I won't disturb your agenda today.

**[00:01:13] Alex Carlin**
> So that's great.

**[00:01:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And speaking of which, I will now find my agenda for today.

**[00:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> Okay.

**[00:01:20] Alex Carlin**
> Excellent.

**[00:01:20] Alex Carlin**
> So you're John.

**[00:01:21] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, respects highly of you.

**[00:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> I love your title, by the way, Eco, if I can just blab while you're doing this.

**[00:01:29] Alex Carlin**
> Eco restoration is exactly what I'm into.

**[00:01:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Exactly.

**[00:01:34] Alex Carlin**
> We're focused on the ocean, as you know, the Russ George kind of stuff.

**[00:01:39] Alex Carlin**
> Of course.

**[00:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> Power, the plankton restoration is what we're focused on.

**[00:01:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now you shouldn't blab because I'm finding I'm having trouble finding the what I'm looking for on my screen.

**[00:01:52] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, and go ahead.

**[00:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah.

**[00:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> So anyway, it's just it's super exciting that we have this thing called Africa will be the leader.

**[00:01:57] Alex Carlin**
> I can play the song right now.

**[00:01:58] Alex Carlin**
> That's it's led by a and.

**[00:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Some that we wrote that I wrote that it's like we are the world rather children, but it's not for charity It's it's showing Africa as the leader Not and you're not the victim But the leader because we've obviously been let down by the US and Europe and the leaders for the last 50 years But now Africa is the leader and that's what the songs about and that's what our actions are about got it It's pretty exciting Hello, hello grants.

**[00:02:31] Alex Carlin**
> Hello, Ananda Yeah, we're the early birds I also have to I also have to leave in 45 You're on for now in a half today 90 minutes.

**[00:02:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, it's typically it's it's two hours I'm gonna try to give myself an extra 10 minutes.

**[00:02:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a a meeting at next door I

**[00:03:00] sustainavistas**
> I'll do it later but I'll do it in the chat as well but I want to wish everybody happy by a diversity day today because it's a big one, it's the big big big one and we don't want to get too many of these commercial banking financial institutions coming up some derivative of how they can take 30 to 50% of all the money going to buy diversity and make profits again, right?

**[00:10:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:10:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Um, it's, um, afternoon from Nigeria.

**[00:10:17] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I believe it's morning for the majority of us on the call.

**[00:10:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So permit me to say good morning to everyone.

**[00:10:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:10:30] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:10:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am, uh, fortunately an echo restoration alliance member.

**[00:10:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And, um, a couple of times I've also had a privilege to be on the town hall meeting.

**[00:10:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is not my first.

**[00:10:52] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm glad that, um, that is, um, Samuel O'Shill is my name, um, currently in Nigeria.

**[00:10:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm in Nigeria.

**[00:11:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I'm also residing in Nigeria and I don't know if my screen is up.

**[00:11:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Can we see my screen?

**[00:11:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[00:11:07] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> just have to put three slide back here that I'll probably just speak to.

**[00:11:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I do quite a bit of things and part of what I do resonates with climate restoration, climate mitigation, climate adaptation and that is why I am particularly interested in for restoration activities across the African continent.

**[00:11:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am the president of the African network of green ambassadors.

**[00:11:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We are pushing forward green actions across 28 African countries as we speak at the moment and also happen to be the chairman of the Board of Sustainable Green Environment Initiative.

**[00:11:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The community of young individuals posturing the act of sustainability and green actions across African continent.

**[00:11:57] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I also happen to be part of the Green Building Council in Nigeria.

**[00:12:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I do a lot of advocacy in the climate change space.

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**

> Medium last year.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**

> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:00] Cory Albers**
> to happen that cleanses the water and ultimately produces something of use for the community.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:37:52] Cory Albers**

**[00:38:01] Cory Albers**
> So the one we're proposing here is 36 hectares, so it's six times the size of the one that you saw few moments ago.

**[00:38:11] Cory Albers**
> And therefore, it's an environment in which we can create these incredibly beautiful places.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**
> recreation, and true connection between human beings can happen in these spaces.

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

**[00:39:25] Cory Albers**
> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**
> It's not a building where worship happens.

**[00:39:33] Cory Albers**
> It's an environment where the worship can be enhanced.

**[00:39:42] Cory Albers**
> And I'll just leave it here.

**[00:39:44] Cory Albers**

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And our paths and experiential education, John and Jake and I, what I'm trying to say, we're involved with the Eco Restoration Alliance that then the work that Mara had been doing in Buffalo converged in this effort in a new go, which was co-sponsored by the Eco Restoration Alliance, that has led to this experiential education program that Sami has told us about, which is really very exciting, the notion that there's now apparently a commitment to one hectare of land for each of 250 schools that's going to have an experiential ecological regenerative education program built into it, is a huge victory and contribution.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very, can be very excited to see how that develops.

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> what is the main concern here?

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And part of this project is a wild land fire management.

**[00:54:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I grew up planting trees, now it's not possible longer.

**[00:54:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Longer possible because of the drought.

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Spring is the worst season in Mexico because of the latitude.

**[00:54:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It brings the drought, heat waves and the forest fires.

**[00:54:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> in a tree plant, firefighter tells the whole story about climate change, how real it is, it's changing our landscape and way of living.

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Then we set up a character of the two projects of the world and was worked as a reference, and it took

**[00:55:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Because three governors to make this really happen.

**[00:55:04] robertopedrazaruiz**
> 12 years ago, it was just a small tax on the vehicles.

**[00:55:12] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In 2020, the price of the world on tonscare served as an example.

**[00:55:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> finally, two years ago, the Canada State Congress approved a new law.

**[00:55:23] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Saudi industry basically my state have to pay carbon tax.

**[00:55:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a self-financing mechanism.

**[00:55:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's paying who is making the dirty business.

**[00:55:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And the funding is coming to share a order to pay first owners to offset the carbon emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**
> We've been doing this for a couple years now.

**[01:00:51] Alex Carlin**
> We did four countries where we did concerts and press conferences We did a cookie bar Ghana Togo and Benine.

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**
> best in Africa, I think, from Abi-John.

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:28:01] sustainavistas**
> I have to say goodbye.

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**
> So when till we're going to have something and in the

**[01:29:00] sustainavistas**
> some of this is going to be an incredible party and things to celebrate in Amsterdam next year.

**[01:29:03] sustainavistas**
> So put that in your agenda, guys.

**[01:29:05] sustainavistas**
> And once again, thank you very much.

**[01:29:08] sustainavistas**
> And goodbye everyone.

> Grant is coming fairly close to volunteering to chair our public events committee.

**[01:29:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we'll have to follow up on that.

**[01:29:22] sustainavistas**
> When there's a band, is banned, I love it.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:29:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see his lips are moving as if he's he's he's preparing.

**[01:29:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to say let's take a few minutes and just introduce ourselves if we haven't already.

**[01:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My top row, everyone has been introduced.

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> I mean, this is so amazing.

**[01:32:03] Russ Speer**
> All the different reports on the different projects.

**[01:32:07] Russ Speer**
> I think we got climate change, excuse me, not climate change, global warming on the run.

**[01:32:15] Russ Speer**
> There are actually several companies full, all of whom make great returns on the investment, and all of them who bring down huge amounts of carbon and mostly turn it into repurpose it into living carbon.

**[01:32:33] Russ Speer**
> Which, of course, we get enough living carbon off, things start cooling off, gets reasonable again.

**[01:32:41] Russ Speer**
> So lots of reasons for optimism.

**[01:32:44] Russ Speer**
> I should probably give a presentation in about a month or two.

**[01:32:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:00:28] Alex Carlin**
> So I can, I'm really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:32] Alex Carlin**
> I only have about 30, 40 minutes before I have to get ready for that meeting.

**[00:00:37] Alex Carlin**
> So I just want to mention that up top that I might, I'm not being rude if I leave, I have to do something else.

**[00:00:44] Alex Carlin**
> But I'm really, really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:47] Alex Carlin**
> And if there's any chance to be super briefly about what my project is, that would be wonderful as well.

**[00:00:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, well, we'll begin with a brief round of introductions, just a sentence.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> or two.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But then we'll ask you back to give us a presentation, if you like.

**[00:01:04] Alex Carlin**
> Well, that would be fantastic.

**[00:01:06] Alex Carlin**
> You mean a different day?

**[00:01:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:01:08] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, that'd be wonderful.

**[00:01:09] Alex Carlin**
> That'd be perfect.

**[00:01:10] Alex Carlin**
> Then I won't I won't disturb your agenda today.

**[00:01:13] Alex Carlin**
> So that's great.

**[00:01:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> Okay.

**[00:01:20] Alex Carlin**

**[00:01:29] Alex Carlin**
> Eco restoration is exactly what I'm into.

**[00:01:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Exactly.

**[00:01:34] Alex Carlin**
> We're focused on the ocean, as you know, the Russ George kind of stuff.

**[00:01:39] Alex Carlin**
> Of course.

**[00:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> Power, the plankton restoration is what we're focused on.

**[00:01:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now you shouldn't blab because I'm finding I'm having trouble finding the what I'm looking for on my screen.

**[00:01:52] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, and go ahead.

**[00:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah.

**[00:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> So anyway, it's just it's super exciting that we have this thing called Africa will be the leader.

**[00:01:57] Alex Carlin**
> I can play the song right now.

**[00:01:58] Alex Carlin**
> That's it's led by a and.

**[00:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Some that we wrote that I wrote that it's like we are the world rather children, but it's not for charity It's it's showing Africa as the leader Not and you're not the victim But the leader because we've obviously been let down by the US and Europe and the leaders for the last 50 years But now Africa is the leader and that's what the songs about and that's what our actions are about got it It's pretty exciting Hello, hello grants.

**[00:02:31] Alex Carlin**

> I'll do it later but I'll do it in the chat as well but I want to wish everybody happy by a diversity day today because it's a big one, it's the big big big one and we don't want to get too many of these commercial banking financial institutions coming up some derivative of how they can take 30 to 50% of all the money going to buy diversity and make profits again, right?

**[00:03:23] sustainavistas**
> The hedge funds kind of, yeah, we had quite a nice event on on Monday we had a biodiversity day with our new, we've just got a one hectare, we've launched a new one hectare garden and I actually showed Jake and on Saturday he was quite impressed the difference it's made.

**[00:03:40] sustainavistas**
> We've actually got a green desert where they just, we put up an insect hotel for we could have like a thousand solar tree, pollinators, bee, solar tree bees and in four months we haven't got one.

**[00:10:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Okay.

**[00:10:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Um, it's, um, afternoon from Nigeria.

**[00:10:17] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I believe it's morning for the majority of us on the call.

**[00:10:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So permit me to say good morning to everyone.

**[00:10:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:10:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's great to be here today.

**[00:10:30] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'll just I'll briefly, uh, give us another view of who I am.

**[00:10:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am, uh, fortunately an echo restoration alliance member.

**[00:10:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And, um, a couple of times I've also had a privilege to be on the town hall meeting.

**[00:10:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is not my first.

**[00:10:52] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm glad that, um, that is, um, Samuel O'Shill is my name, um, currently in Nigeria.

**[00:10:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm in Nigeria.

**[00:11:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I'm also residing in Nigeria and I don't know if my screen is up.

**[00:11:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Can we see my screen?

**[00:11:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[00:11:07] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> just have to put three slide back here that I'll probably just speak to.

**[00:11:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I do quite a bit of things and part of what I do resonates with climate restoration, climate mitigation, climate adaptation and that is why I am particularly interested in for restoration activities across the African continent.

**[00:11:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am the president of the African network of green ambassadors.

**[00:11:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We are pushing forward green actions across 28 African countries as we speak at the moment and also happen to be the chairman of the Board of Sustainable Green Environment Initiative.

**[00:11:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The community of young individuals posturing the act of sustainability and green actions across African continent.

**[00:11:57] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I also happen to be part of the Green Building Council in Nigeria.

**[00:12:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I do a lot of advocacy in the climate change space.

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**

> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And our paths and experiential education, John and Jake and I, what I'm trying to say, we're involved with the Eco Restoration Alliance that then the work that Mara had been doing in Buffalo converged in this effort in a new go, which was co-sponsored by the Eco Restoration Alliance, that has led to this experiential education program that Sami has told us about, which is really very exciting, the notion that there's now apparently a commitment to one hectare of land for each of 250 schools that's going to have an experiential ecological regenerative education program built into it, is a huge victory and contribution.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very, can be very excited to see how that develops.

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So each of these stories is unique, but it's really very interesting and exciting to see how all these connections, and I'm sure I left them any out, are converging.

**[00:44:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:49:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In our case, agricultural and cow ranching have led forest barns, landslides, dry creeks, forest fires, and poverty.

**[00:49:14] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So what to keep doing the same?

**[00:49:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin years ago to try to convert CO2 as a conservation asset for local communities and forest owners, because every piece of these mountains has a local owner and without another income, they will keep slashing and burning the forest and stay poor.

**[00:49:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin the calculation, the methodology, I work for the group, because here at Gordon, I'm in church of a network of private nature reserves within this mountains landscape and also a wildlife photographer.

**[00:51:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And planting corn in these mountains is nonsense because their bare-steep slopes, they best more work and money than actually crops, they're getting and not even self-sufficient.

**[00:51:30] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we need to give value and the real income to local forest owners to change that evil scheme.

**[00:51:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So with the world and trust, we develop a first project.

**[00:51:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Based on our local calculations of how much carbon is storing the forest and how much increases removing cattle and chainsaws.

**[00:51:52] robertopedrazaruiz**

> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**
> We've been doing this for a couple years now.

**[01:00:51] Alex Carlin**
> We did four countries where we did concerts and press conferences We did a cookie bar Ghana Togo and Benine.

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**
> best in Africa, I think, from Abi-John.

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

> We have a full schedule and we have several different groups here that are pressed for time.

**[00:09:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to begin with a couple of presentations about recent projects.

**[00:09:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, do we have Samni Konkanko and Corey here at this time?

**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And should we wait for Corey?

**[00:09:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Hello?

**[00:09:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Hello?

**[00:09:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm on the phone.

**[00:09:29] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Oh, okay.

**[00:09:31] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's good to be here today.

**[00:09:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[00:09:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:09:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, we will begin with an update from Samni Konkanko, Corey, who are working on water and Nigeria.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How's that?

**[00:09:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> who begins?

**[00:09:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> According to my notes, Samni is introducing them, but Mabel Michael wants to introduce them.

**[00:09:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll let you take it from here.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> take it away.

**[00:10:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Hello, Sam, you're on mute.

**[00:10:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Okay.

**[00:10:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Um, it's, um, afternoon from Nigeria.

**[00:10:17] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I believe it's morning for the majority of us on the call.

**[00:10:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So permit me to say good morning to everyone.

**[00:10:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Um, morning.

**[00:10:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's great to be here today.

**[00:10:30] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'll just I'll briefly, uh, give us another view of who I am.

**[00:10:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am, uh, fortunately an echo restoration alliance member.

**[00:10:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And, um, a couple of times I've also had a privilege to be on the town hall meeting.

**[00:10:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is not my first.

**[00:10:52] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm glad that, um, that is, um, Samuel O'Shill is my name, um, currently in Nigeria.

**[00:10:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm in Nigeria.

**[00:11:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I'm also residing in Nigeria and I don't know if my screen is up.

**[00:11:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Can we see my screen?

**[00:11:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[00:11:07] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> just have to put three slide back here that I'll probably just speak to.

**[00:11:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I do quite a bit of things and part of what I do resonates with climate restoration, climate mitigation, climate adaptation and that is why I am particularly interested in for restoration activities across the African continent.

**[00:11:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am the president of the African network of green ambassadors.

**[00:11:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We are pushing forward green actions across 28 African countries as we speak at the moment and also happen to be the chairman of the Board of Sustainable Green Environment Initiative.

**[00:11:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The community of young individuals posturing the act of sustainability and green actions across African continent.

**[00:11:57] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I also happen to be part of the Green Building Council in Nigeria.

**[00:12:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I do a lot of advocacy in the climate change space.

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:00] Cory Albers**
> to happen that cleanses the water and ultimately produces something of use for the community.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**

**[00:48:54] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:48:57] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:49:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to change the additional activities.

**[00:49:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In our case, agricultural and cow ranching have led forest barns, landslides, dry creeks, forest fires, and poverty.

**[00:49:14] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So what to keep doing the same?

**[00:49:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin years ago to try to convert CO2 as a conservation asset for local communities and forest owners, because every piece of these mountains has a local owner and without another income, they will keep slashing and burning the forest and stay poor.

**[00:49:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin the calculation, the methodology, I work for the group, because here at Gordon, I'm in church of a network of private nature reserves within this mountains landscape and also a wildlife photographer.

> the images you are going to see here are part of the beneficiaries.

**[00:49:55] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:49:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> To develop this

**[00:50:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It is key to have different partners at the world and trust, based in the UK, which is supporting two different carbon projects and the greater state governments through the Sadesu or Secretariat, Sabrei, Sustin, Tablei.

**[00:50:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So that green area is where the Sierra Gordon is based, of the Eastern Sierra Madre, is the most eco diverse protected area, because it's a advisory reserve, and remember that San Mexico is one of the top 10 mega diverse countries in the world, so it's really piece of cake this mountains and by a local diversity day, the carbo.

**[00:50:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It covers almost a million acres from desert to temperate forest, cloud forest, tropical forest, riparian forest, so a little piece of Mexico is comprised in these mountains.

**[00:50:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We're fighting carbo-ranching, carbo-cave here in the 16th century, and it's an exotic wildlife, I mean not wildlife, but found animals.

**[00:51:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> not be roaming Mexican forests.

**[00:51:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's the difference between one protected without cattle and the right side, one overgraced without junk trees or understory, eliminating a whole layer of the forest and damaging biodiversity.

**[00:51:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And planting corn in these mountains is nonsense because their bare-steep slopes, they best more work and money than actually crops, they're getting and not even self-sufficient.

**[00:51:30] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we need to give value and the real income to local forest owners to change that evil scheme.

**[00:51:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So with the world and trust, we develop a first project.

**[00:51:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Based on our local calculations of how much carbon is storing the forest and how much increases removing cattle and chainsaws.

**[00:51:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Also logging has done a lot of damage to these best trees are gone, but still a very nice forest.

**[00:51:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So in hilly plants,

**[00:52:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's a list of the sea, on the east side of the Sierra Gorda, we're working with four different Hidos, which are coming up properly.

**[00:52:06] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Almost 5,000 hectares of forest were no more land clearance, no logging, and no use of fire.

**[00:52:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that force really, a piece of cake, and these friends are respecting the view, and the force is doing great.

**[00:52:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And then within the Sierra Gorda, additional work with 26 private owners, one Hido, protecting 2,500 hectares between the nature reserves.

**[00:52:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In green are the private nature reserves, we're protecting mostly cloud forest.

**[00:52:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Why cloud forest?

**[00:52:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> cloud forest is covered less than 1% in Mexico.

**[00:52:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They covered 12% of the explorer, and 33% is endemic.

**[00:52:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you want to make great conservation and that conversation you have to take.

**[00:53:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to take care of the cloud forest.

**[00:53:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in JLO, the properties involved in these payments of carbon and remember no more cattle or chasels or forest fires.

**[00:53:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in blue, the commercial property outside the state of getting cattle.

**[00:53:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this pretty several as sorry, about the payments that are done every six months.

**[00:53:24] robertopedrazaruiz**
> People is getting 100% of their money for the carbon, not a small percentage with a carbon brokers and developers and all those pirates.

**[00:53:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And payments are done a very public way.

**[00:53:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They received a check in front of their fellow landowners.

**[00:53:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They can use the money they've decided themselves have to use their resources.

**[00:53:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We don't conditionate, you have to spend the money on this and this and this.

**[00:53:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> what is the main concern here?

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And part of this project is a wild land fire management.

**[00:54:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I grew up planting trees, now it's not possible longer.

**[00:54:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Longer possible because of the drought.

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Spring is the worst season in Mexico because of the latitude.

**[00:54:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It brings the drought, heat waves and the forest fires.

**[00:54:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> in a tree plant, firefighter tells the whole story about climate change, how real it is, it's changing our landscape and way of living.

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Then we set up a character of the two projects of the world and was worked as a reference, and it took

**[00:55:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Because three governors to make this really happen.

**[00:55:04] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:55:23] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Saudi industry basically my state have to pay carbon tax.

**[00:55:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a self-financing mechanism.

**[00:55:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's paying who is making the dirty business.

**[00:55:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And the funding is coming to share a order to pay first owners to offset the carbon emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:27:57] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, hi, guys.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**

**[01:28:01] sustainavistas**
> I have to say goodbye.

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**
> So when till we're going to have something and in the

**[01:29:00] sustainavistas**

**[01:29:05] sustainavistas**
> And once again, thank you very much.

**[01:29:08] sustainavistas**

> We are pushing forward green actions across 28 African countries as we speak at the moment and also happen to be the chairman of the Board of Sustainable Green Environment Initiative.

**[00:11:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The community of young individuals posturing the act of sustainability and green actions across African continent.

**[00:11:57] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I also happen to be part of the Green Building Council in Nigeria.

**[00:12:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I do a lot of advocacy in the climate change space.

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:00] Cory Albers**
> to happen that cleanses the water and ultimately produces something of use for the community.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:37:52] Cory Albers**
> Just for perspective the last flagship project that I showed you with the videos looping was only a six

**[00:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> to hack our site.

**[00:38:01] Cory Albers**
> So the one we're proposing here is 36 hectares, so it's six times the size of the one that you saw few moments ago.

**[00:38:11] Cory Albers**
> And therefore, it's an environment in which we can create these incredibly beautiful places.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**
> these are some conceptual examples that we've created, just to indicate the the type of space that we expect to be able to create, the look and feel in this particular location.

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**
> recreation, and true connection between human beings can happen in these spaces.

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

**[00:39:25] Cory Albers**
> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**
> It's not a building where worship happens.

**[00:39:33] Cory Albers**
> It's an environment where the worship can be enhanced.

**[00:39:42] Cory Albers**
> And I'll just leave it here.

**[00:39:44] Cory Albers**
> There's obviously plenty of things that we could continue talking about, but this was one of my favorite photos we took on the trip of myself on the

**[00:40:02] Cory Albers**
> So I'm honored to have had the opportunity to speak to you today.

**[00:40:07] Cory Albers**
> Thank you so much.

**[00:40:08] Cory Albers**
> And I think we'll just turn it back to you, John here.

**[00:40:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Absolutely.

**[00:40:14] Michael Mayer**
> I'm just going to wrap things up little bit here.

**[00:40:18] Michael Mayer**
> The scope of the project in state and in Nugu State are really quite different.

**[00:40:26] Michael Mayer**
> And between them, there is a hybrid model that is evolving.

**[00:41:16] Michael Mayer**
> Obviously a massive project and what we're doing is staging it over time to be able to get all of the stakeholders in Indigenous traditional right up through local and even national government with international partners as a way to model what can happen when everyone gets together both at the community level and more broadly to make a sustainable step of both supporting climate initiatives and quality of life.

**[00:41:46] Michael Mayer**

**[00:42:10] Michael Mayer**

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just been thinking about how the heck did this come about, and it's sort of an interesting case of networking and about the ERA, for what it's worth.

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And our paths and experiential education, John and Jake and I, what I'm trying to say, we're involved with the Eco Restoration Alliance that then the work that Mara had been doing in Buffalo converged in this effort in a new go, which was co-sponsored by the Eco Restoration Alliance, that has led to this experiential education program that Sami has told us about, which is really very exciting, the notion that there's now apparently a commitment to one hectare of land for each of 250 schools that's going to have an experiential ecological regenerative education program built into it, is a huge victory and contribution.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very, can be very excited to see how that develops.

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that, of course, has led to partly from a trip that Jake and the

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as we've seen from those incredible pictures by Corey, there's a huge amount of ecological learning and ecological regeneration to be done in pulling together this initiative.

**[00:44:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So each of these stories is unique, but it's really very interesting and exciting to see how all these connections, and I'm sure I left them any out, are converging.

**[00:44:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you for the update.

**[00:44:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:56] Alex Carlin**
> So,

**[00:45:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> ERA increasingly is finding itself in the role of facilitator of projects that its members can do together and helping them do things together, helping us do things together that we can't each do individually.

**[00:45:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Another one of those projects for us has become the Panama initiative that Rob is spearheading.

**[00:45:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Natalie Rios Duran is here also, who is our project manager in Panama and introduced herself last week to that end.

**[00:45:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the essence of that project is to try to find a way to restore the Panama watershed and its moisture sources in order to refill the pesky Panama canal, saving the world economy up to $50 billion a year.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And, of course, focus the world's attention on what really matters, namely ecological regeneration.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A piece of that puzzle is going to be to figure out how to mobilize finance as well as the population to figure out what they really need, what they really want, what they really know how to do, and work with them to come up with the kind of water solution that they really In that connection, we, the ERA, has allies in the group of ecological Sierra Gorda in Mexico, who showed up, I think, at our very first town hall meeting, and have done wonderful work in the last two to three years that we've been here.

**[00:46:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:48:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Hello, Lara.

**[00:48:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, I believe that we have three guests today, Lara, Roberto Pedroza from Wildlands Conservation, who's going to give us some background, Ross from the Biodiversity Carbon Team, which has developed a really interesting governmental and subnational governance methodology, and Alex Watson from Open Forests, who's going to talk about traceability and effectiveness.

**[00:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:48:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> morning in Mexico.

**[00:48:54] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for this space.

**[00:48:57] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I'm going to share our experience since you got to go to that fine

**[00:49:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to change the additional activities.

**[00:49:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In our case, agricultural and cow ranching have led forest barns, landslides, dry creeks, forest fires, and poverty.

**[00:49:14] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So what to keep doing the same?

**[00:49:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin years ago to try to convert CO2 as a conservation asset for local communities and forest owners, because every piece of these mountains has a local owner and without another income, they will keep slashing and burning the forest and stay poor.

**[00:49:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin the calculation, the methodology, I work for the group, because here at Gordon, I'm in church of a network of private nature reserves within this mountains landscape and also a wildlife photographer.

**[00:49:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> the images you are going to see here are part of the beneficiaries.

**[00:49:55] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That's why we call our product carbonobe reversal.

**[00:49:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> To develop this

**[00:50:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It is key to have different partners at the world and trust, based in the UK, which is supporting two different carbon projects and the greater state governments through the Sadesu or Secretariat, Sabrei, Sustin, Tablei.

**[00:50:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So that green area is where the Sierra Gordon is based, of the Eastern Sierra Madre, is the most eco diverse protected area, because it's a advisory reserve, and remember that San Mexico is one of the top 10 mega diverse countries in the world, so it's really piece of cake this mountains and by a local diversity day, the carbo.

**[00:50:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It covers almost a million acres from desert to temperate forest, cloud forest, tropical forest, riparian forest, so a little piece of Mexico is comprised in these mountains.

**[00:50:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We're fighting carbo-ranching, carbo-cave here in the 16th century, and it's an exotic wildlife, I mean not wildlife, but found animals.

**[00:51:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> not be roaming Mexican forests.

**[00:51:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's the difference between one protected without cattle and the right side, one overgraced without junk trees or understory, eliminating a whole layer of the forest and damaging biodiversity.

**[00:51:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And planting corn in these mountains is nonsense because their bare-steep slopes, they best more work and money than actually crops, they're getting and not even self-sufficient.

**[00:51:30] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we need to give value and the real income to local forest owners to change that evil scheme.

**[00:51:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So with the world and trust, we develop a first project.

**[00:51:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Based on our local calculations of how much carbon is storing the forest and how much increases removing cattle and chainsaws.

**[00:51:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Also logging has done a lot of damage to these best trees are gone, but still a very nice forest.

**[00:51:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So in hilly plants,

**[00:52:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's a list of the sea, on the east side of the Sierra Gorda, we're working with four different Hidos, which are coming up properly.

**[00:52:06] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Almost 5,000 hectares of forest were no more land clearance, no logging, and no use of fire.

**[00:52:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that force really, a piece of cake, and these friends are respecting the view, and the force is doing great.

**[00:52:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And then within the Sierra Gorda, additional work with 26 private owners, one Hido, protecting 2,500 hectares between the nature reserves.

**[00:52:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In green are the private nature reserves, we're protecting mostly cloud forest.

**[00:52:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Why cloud forest?

**[00:52:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> cloud forest is covered less than 1% in Mexico.

**[00:52:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They covered 12% of the explorer, and 33% is endemic.

**[00:52:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you want to make great conservation and that conversation you have to take.

**[00:53:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to take care of the cloud forest.

**[00:53:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in JLO, the properties involved in these payments of carbon and remember no more cattle or chasels or forest fires.

**[00:53:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in blue, the commercial property outside the state of getting cattle.

**[00:53:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this pretty several as sorry, about the payments that are done every six months.

**[00:53:24] robertopedrazaruiz**
> People is getting 100% of their money for the carbon, not a small percentage with a carbon brokers and developers and all those pirates.

**[00:53:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And payments are done a very public way.

**[00:53:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They received a check in front of their fellow landowners.

**[00:53:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They can use the money they've decided themselves have to use their resources.

**[00:53:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We don't conditionate, you have to spend the money on this and this and this.

**[00:53:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> what is the main concern here?

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And part of this project is a wild land fire management.

**[00:54:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I grew up planting trees, now it's not possible longer.

**[00:54:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Longer possible because of the drought.

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Spring is the worst season in Mexico because of the latitude.

**[00:54:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It brings the drought, heat waves and the forest fires.

**[00:54:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> in a tree plant, firefighter tells the whole story about climate change, how real it is, it's changing our landscape and way of living.

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Then we set up a character of the two projects of the world and was worked as a reference, and it took

**[00:55:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Because three governors to make this really happen.

**[00:55:04] robertopedrazaruiz**
> 12 years ago, it was just a small tax on the vehicles.

**[00:55:12] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In 2020, the price of the world on tonscare served as an example.

**[00:55:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> finally, two years ago, the Canada State Congress approved a new law.

**[00:55:23] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Saudi industry basically my state have to pay carbon tax.

**[00:55:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a self-financing mechanism.

**[00:55:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's paying who is making the dirty business.

**[00:55:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And the funding is coming to share a order to pay first owners to offset the carbon emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's take a deep breath.

**[01:27:56] sustainavistas**
> Grant?

**[01:27:57] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, hi, guys.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Sorry.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**

**[01:28:01] sustainavistas**
> I have to say goodbye.

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**
> So when till we're going to have something and in the

**[01:29:00] sustainavistas**
> some of this is going to be an incredible party and things to celebrate in Amsterdam next year.

**[01:29:03] sustainavistas**
> So put that in your agenda, guys.

**[01:29:05] sustainavistas**
> And once again, thank you very much.

**[01:29:08] sustainavistas**
> And goodbye everyone.

**[01:30:32] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> How's that?

**[01:30:33] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> All right.

**[01:30:34] Ananda Fitzsimmons**

> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:00] Cory Albers**
> to happen that cleanses the water and ultimately produces something of use for the community.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:37:52] Cory Albers**
> Just for perspective the last flagship project that I showed you with the videos looping was only a six

**[00:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> to hack our site.

**[00:38:01] Cory Albers**
> So the one we're proposing here is 36 hectares, so it's six times the size of the one that you saw few moments ago.

**[00:38:11] Cory Albers**
> And therefore, it's an environment in which we can create these incredibly beautiful places.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**
> these are some conceptual examples that we've created, just to indicate the the type of space that we expect to be able to create, the look and feel in this particular location.

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**
> recreation, and true connection between human beings can happen in these spaces.

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

**[00:39:25] Cory Albers**
> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**
> It's not a building where worship happens.

**[00:39:33] Cory Albers**
> It's an environment where the worship can be enhanced.

**[00:39:42] Cory Albers**
> And I'll just leave it here.

**[00:39:44] Cory Albers**
> There's obviously plenty of things that we could continue talking about, but this was one of my favorite photos we took on the trip of myself on the

**[00:40:02] Cory Albers**

**[00:40:07] Cory Albers**
> Thank you so much.

**[00:40:08] Cory Albers**
> And I think we'll just turn it back to you, John here.

**[00:40:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Absolutely.

**[00:40:14] Michael Mayer**
> I'm just going to wrap things up little bit here.

**[00:40:18] Michael Mayer**

**[00:42:10] Michael Mayer**

**[00:42:15] Michael Mayer**
> So thank you for listening, and John, do we have time for a few Q and A's if casual allows?

**[00:42:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just been thinking about how the heck did this come about, and it's sort of an interesting case of networking and about the ERA, for what it's worth.

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And our paths and experiential education, John and Jake and I, what I'm trying to say, we're involved with the Eco Restoration Alliance that then the work that Mara had been doing in Buffalo converged in this effort in a new go, which was co-sponsored by the Eco Restoration Alliance, that has led to this experiential education program that Sami has told us about, which is really very exciting, the notion that there's now apparently a commitment to one hectare of land for each of 250 schools that's going to have an experiential ecological regenerative education program built into it, is a huge victory and contribution.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very, can be very excited to see how that develops.

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as we've seen from those incredible pictures by Corey, there's a huge amount of ecological learning and ecological regeneration to be done in pulling together this initiative.

**[00:44:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So each of these stories is unique, but it's really very interesting and exciting to see how all these connections, and I'm sure I left them any out, are converging.

**[00:47:57] Grupo Ecológico Sierra Gorda I.A.P.**
> everyone, I'm Sierra Gordo back.

**[00:48:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Hello, Lara.

**[00:48:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, I believe that we have three guests today, Lara, Roberto Pedroza from Wildlands Conservation, who's going to give us some background, Ross from the Biodiversity Carbon Team, which has developed a really interesting governmental and subnational governance methodology, and Alex Watson from Open Forests, who's going to talk about traceability and effectiveness.

**[00:48:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have to leave it to the aforementioned to decide who's going to present next, because I don't know.

**[00:48:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Beto, Roberto Pedroza will be the first to speak.

**[00:48:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right then.

**[00:48:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Hi, John.

**[00:48:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Hi, everybody.

**[00:48:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> morning in Mexico.

**[00:48:54] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for this space.

**[00:48:57] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I'm going to share our experience since you got to go to that fine

**[00:49:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to change the additional activities.

**[00:49:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In our case, agricultural and cow ranching have led forest barns, landslides, dry creeks, forest fires, and poverty.

**[00:49:14] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So what to keep doing the same?

**[00:49:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin years ago to try to convert CO2 as a conservation asset for local communities and forest owners, because every piece of these mountains has a local owner and without another income, they will keep slashing and burning the forest and stay poor.

**[00:49:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin the calculation, the methodology, I work for the group, because here at Gordon, I'm in church of a network of private nature reserves within this mountains landscape and also a wildlife photographer.

**[00:49:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> the images you are going to see here are part of the beneficiaries.

**[00:49:55] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That's why we call our product carbonobe reversal.

**[00:49:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> To develop this

**[00:50:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It is key to have different partners at the world and trust, based in the UK, which is supporting two different carbon projects and the greater state governments through the Sadesu or Secretariat, Sabrei, Sustin, Tablei.

**[00:50:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So that green area is where the Sierra Gordon is based, of the Eastern Sierra Madre, is the most eco diverse protected area, because it's a advisory reserve, and remember that San Mexico is one of the top 10 mega diverse countries in the world, so it's really piece of cake this mountains and by a local diversity day, the carbo.

**[00:50:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It covers almost a million acres from desert to temperate forest, cloud forest, tropical forest, riparian forest, so a little piece of Mexico is comprised in these mountains.

**[00:50:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We're fighting carbo-ranching, carbo-cave here in the 16th century, and it's an exotic wildlife, I mean not wildlife, but found animals.

**[00:51:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> not be roaming Mexican forests.

**[00:51:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's the difference between one protected without cattle and the right side, one overgraced without junk trees or understory, eliminating a whole layer of the forest and damaging biodiversity.

**[00:51:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And planting corn in these mountains is nonsense because their bare-steep slopes, they best more work and money than actually crops, they're getting and not even self-sufficient.

**[00:51:30] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we need to give value and the real income to local forest owners to change that evil scheme.

**[00:51:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So with the world and trust, we develop a first project.

**[00:51:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Based on our local calculations of how much carbon is storing the forest and how much increases removing cattle and chainsaws.

**[00:51:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Also logging has done a lot of damage to these best trees are gone, but still a very nice forest.

**[00:51:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So in hilly plants,

**[00:52:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's a list of the sea, on the east side of the Sierra Gorda, we're working with four different Hidos, which are coming up properly.

**[00:52:06] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Almost 5,000 hectares of forest were no more land clearance, no logging, and no use of fire.

**[00:52:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that force really, a piece of cake, and these friends are respecting the view, and the force is doing great.

**[00:52:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And then within the Sierra Gorda, additional work with 26 private owners, one Hido, protecting 2,500 hectares between the nature reserves.

**[00:52:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In green are the private nature reserves, we're protecting mostly cloud forest.

**[00:52:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Why cloud forest?

**[00:52:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> cloud forest is covered less than 1% in Mexico.

**[00:52:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They covered 12% of the explorer, and 33% is endemic.

**[00:52:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you want to make great conservation and that conversation you have to take.

**[00:53:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to take care of the cloud forest.

**[00:53:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in JLO, the properties involved in these payments of carbon and remember no more cattle or chasels or forest fires.

**[00:53:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in blue, the commercial property outside the state of getting cattle.

**[00:53:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this pretty several as sorry, about the payments that are done every six months.

**[00:53:24] robertopedrazaruiz**
> People is getting 100% of their money for the carbon, not a small percentage with a carbon brokers and developers and all those pirates.

**[00:53:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And payments are done a very public way.

**[00:53:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They received a check in front of their fellow landowners.

**[00:53:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They can use the money they've decided themselves have to use their resources.

**[00:53:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We don't conditionate, you have to spend the money on this and this and this.

**[00:53:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> what is the main concern here?

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And part of this project is a wild land fire management.

**[00:54:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I grew up planting trees, now it's not possible longer.

**[00:54:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Longer possible because of the drought.

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Spring is the worst season in Mexico because of the latitude.

**[00:54:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It brings the drought, heat waves and the forest fires.

**[00:54:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> in a tree plant, firefighter tells the whole story about climate change, how real it is, it's changing our landscape and way of living.

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Then we set up a character of the two projects of the world and was worked as a reference, and it took

**[00:55:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Because three governors to make this really happen.

**[00:55:04] robertopedrazaruiz**
> 12 years ago, it was just a small tax on the vehicles.

**[00:55:12] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In 2020, the price of the world on tonscare served as an example.

**[00:55:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> finally, two years ago, the Canada State Congress approved a new law.

**[00:55:23] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Saudi industry basically my state have to pay carbon tax.

**[00:55:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a self-financing mechanism.

**[00:55:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's paying who is making the dirty business.

**[00:55:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And the funding is coming to share a order to pay first owners to offset the carbon emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**
> We've been doing this for a couple years now.

**[01:00:51] Alex Carlin**
> We did four countries where we did concerts and press conferences We did a cookie bar Ghana Togo and Benine.

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**
> best in Africa, I think, from Abi-John.

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's take a deep breath.

**[01:27:56] sustainavistas**
> Grant?

**[01:27:57] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, hi, guys.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Sorry.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Thanks very much.

**[01:28:00] sustainavistas**
> inspiring.

**[01:28:01] sustainavistas**
> I have to say goodbye.

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**
> So when till we're going to have something and in the

**[01:29:00] sustainavistas**
> some of this is going to be an incredible party and things to celebrate in Amsterdam next year.

**[01:29:03] sustainavistas**
> So put that in your agenda, guys.

**[01:29:05] sustainavistas**
> And once again, thank you very much.

**[01:29:08] sustainavistas**
> And goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant is coming fairly close to volunteering to chair our public events committee.

**[01:29:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we'll have to follow up on that.

**[01:29:22] sustainavistas**
> When there's a band, is banned, I love it.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> His email is in the chat.

**[01:29:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm serious.

**[01:29:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Someone needs to start pulling this together.

**[01:29:32] sustainavistas**
> Bye everyone.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cheers guys.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have a good one.

**[01:29:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob has asked for as much time as he can possibly have to prepare his presentation.

**[01:29:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see his lips are moving as if he's he's he's preparing.

**[01:29:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to say let's take a few minutes and just introduce ourselves if we haven't already.

**[01:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My top row, everyone has been introduced.

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Look at that.

**[01:30:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ananda, would you like to say hello?

**[01:30:09] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Hi, everyone.

**[01:30:11] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> We did an old spiel here or just hi, everyone.

**[01:30:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Just hello and who you are so that people want to get in touch with the chair of the steering committee or our new vice president or Ananda, the author of several books on water, they know how to associate your face with your name.

**[01:30:32] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> How's that?

**[01:30:33] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> All right.

**[01:30:34] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Thank you for doing all that for me, John.

**[01:30:39] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Philip.

**[01:30:50] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I heard my name.

**[01:30:52] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I have a back and president of the board of biographical climate and former in crime and other creative projects with

**[01:31:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> John on many many other things.

**[01:31:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:31:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And a member of our board as is Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:11] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> Yeah, I'm Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:13] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> I'm I'm an ecological economist who works with biophor climate and I am, as John said, a member of the ERA Board and could might be to be involved with this organization.

**[01:31:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Russ Spear, who brought us, Alex Carlin and our musical interlude, say hello.

**[01:31:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Or not.

**[01:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Marius.

**[01:31:47] Russ Speer**
> Hello.

**[01:31:49] Russ Speer**
> Hi, sorry.

**[01:31:50] Russ Speer**
> I was pushing a bunch of buttons there.

**[01:31:52] Russ Speer**
> I just I just passed the invitation to come to Amsterdam on to Alex and his band.

**[01:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So wonderful.

**[01:32:01] Russ Speer**
> I mean, this is so amazing.

**[01:32:03] Russ Speer**
> All the different reports on the different projects.

**[01:32:07] Russ Speer**
> I think we got climate change, excuse me, not climate change, global warming on the run.

**[01:32:15] Russ Speer**
> There are actually several companies full, all of whom make great returns on the investment, and all of them who bring down huge amounts of carbon and mostly turn it into repurpose it into living carbon.

**[01:32:33] Russ Speer**
> Which, of course, we get enough living carbon off, things start cooling off, gets reasonable again.

**[01:32:41] Russ Speer**
> So lots of reasons for optimism.

**[01:32:44] Russ Speer**
> I should probably give a presentation in about a month or two.

**[01:32:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I look forward to that, Russ.

**[01:32:50] Russ Speer**
> Thank you.

**[01:32:51] Russ Speer**
> So find the next victim.

**[01:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:32:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Arias, that would be you from Uganda.

**[01:32:57] Russ Speer**
> Are you with us?

**[01:33:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then it will be sending and then it will be with you see him.

**[01:33:06] Ir Marius**
> Hello, Marius.

**[01:33:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:33:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Nice to hear your voice.

**[01:33:18] Ir Marius**
> I'm glad you're with us.

**[01:33:22] Ir Marius**
> Yes, yes, you will.

**[01:33:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cindy, I would say hello briefly if you would.

**[01:33:30] Cindy Eiritz**
> I appreciate listening to this amazing, amazing stuff.

**[01:33:35] Cindy Eiritz**
> It's so inspiring and so uplifting.

**[01:33:37] Cindy Eiritz**

### Mention 8: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 86083:*
```
**[00:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> Happy to be here.

**[00:00:13] Alex Carlin**
> I'm doing a lot of things in And in fact, I do want to mention while we have a second that I have a super important meeting about what we're doing in Ghana coming up in early August.

**[00:00:28] Alex Carlin**
> So I can, I'm really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:32] Alex Carlin**
> I only have about 30, 40 minutes before I have to get ready for that meeting.

**[00:00:37] Alex Carlin**
> So I just want to mention that up top that I might, I'm not being rude if I leave, I have to do something else.

**[00:00:44] Alex Carlin**
> But I'm really, really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:47] Alex Carlin**
> And if there's any chance to be super briefly about what my project is, that would be wonderful as well.

**[00:00:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, well, we'll begin with a brief round of introductions, just a sentence.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> or two.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But then we'll ask you back to give us a presentation, if you like.

**[00:01:04] Alex Carlin**
> Well, that would be fantastic.

**[00:01:06] Alex Carlin**
> You mean a different day?

**[00:01:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:01:08] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, that'd be wonderful.

**[00:01:09] Alex Carlin**
> That'd be perfect.

**[00:01:10] Alex Carlin**
> Then I won't I won't disturb your agenda today.

**[00:01:13] Alex Carlin**
> So that's great.

**[00:01:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And speaking of which, I will now find my agenda for today.

**[00:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> Okay.

**[00:01:20] Alex Carlin**
> Excellent.

**[00:01:20] Alex Carlin**
> So you're John.

**[00:01:21] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, respects highly of you.

**[00:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> I love your title, by the way, Eco, if I can just blab while you're doing this.

**[00:01:29] Alex Carlin**
> Eco restoration is exactly what I'm into.

**[00:01:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Exactly.

**[00:11:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[00:11:07] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> just have to put three slide back here that I'll probably just speak to.

**[00:11:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I do quite a bit of things and part of what I do resonates with climate restoration, climate mitigation, climate adaptation and that is why I am particularly interested in for restoration activities across the African continent.

**[00:11:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am the president of the African network of green ambassadors.

**[00:11:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:00] Cory Albers**
> to happen that cleanses the water and ultimately produces something of use for the community.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:37:52] Cory Albers**
> Just for perspective the last flagship project that I showed you with the videos looping was only a six

**[00:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> to hack our site.

**[00:38:01] Cory Albers**
> So the one we're proposing here is 36 hectares, so it's six times the size of the one that you saw few moments ago.

**[00:38:11] Cory Albers**
> And therefore, it's an environment in which we can create these incredibly beautiful places.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**
> these are some conceptual examples that we've created, just to indicate the the type of space that we expect to be able to create, the look and feel in this particular location.

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**
> recreation, and true connection between human beings can happen in these spaces.

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

**[00:39:25] Cory Albers**
> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**
> It's not a building where worship happens.

**[00:39:33] Cory Albers**
> It's an environment where the worship can be enhanced.

**[00:39:42] Cory Albers**
> And I'll just leave it here.

**[00:39:44] Cory Albers**
> There's obviously plenty of things that we could continue talking about, but this was one of my favorite photos we took on the trip of myself on the

**[00:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:40:02] Cory Albers**
> So I'm honored to have had the opportunity to speak to you today.

**[00:40:07] Cory Albers**
> Thank you so much.

**[00:40:08] Cory Albers**
> And I think we'll just turn it back to you, John here.

**[00:40:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Absolutely.

**[00:40:14] Michael Mayer**
> I'm just going to wrap things up little bit here.

**[00:40:18] Michael Mayer**
> The scope of the project in state and in Nugu State are really quite different.

**[00:40:26] Michael Mayer**
> And between them, there is a hybrid model that is evolving.

**[00:41:46] Michael Mayer**

**[00:42:06] Michael Mayer**
> It's a wonderful growing movement that we have in growing community.

**[00:42:10] Michael Mayer**
> We're building, and ERA is certainly a wonderful part of that on our behalf.

**[00:42:15] Michael Mayer**
> So thank you for listening, and John, do we have time for a few Q and A's if casual allows?

**[00:42:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just been thinking about how the heck did this come about, and it's sort of an interesting case of networking and about the ERA, for what it's worth.

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And our paths and experiential education, John and Jake and I, what I'm trying to say, we're involved with the Eco Restoration Alliance that then the work that Mara had been doing in Buffalo converged in this effort in a new go, which was co-sponsored by the Eco Restoration Alliance, that has led to this experiential education program that Sami has told us about, which is really very exciting, the notion that there's now apparently a commitment to one hectare of land for each of 250 schools that's going to have an experiential ecological regenerative education program built into it, is a huge victory and contribution.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very, can be very excited to see how that develops.

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:44:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as we've seen from those incredible pictures by Corey, there's a huge amount of ecological learning and ecological regeneration to be done in pulling together this initiative.

**[00:44:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So each of these stories is unique, but it's really very interesting and exciting to see how all these connections, and I'm sure I left them any out, are converging.

**[00:44:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> It's a list of the sea, on the east side of the Sierra Gorda, we're working with four different Hidos, which are coming up properly.

**[00:52:06] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Almost 5,000 hectares of forest were no more land clearance, no logging, and no use of fire.

**[00:52:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that force really, a piece of cake, and these friends are respecting the view, and the force is doing great.

**[00:52:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And then within the Sierra Gorda, additional work with 26 private owners, one Hido, protecting 2,500 hectares between the nature reserves.

**[00:52:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In green are the private nature reserves, we're protecting mostly cloud forest.

**[00:52:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Why cloud forest?

**[00:52:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> cloud forest is covered less than 1% in Mexico.

**[00:52:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They covered 12% of the explorer, and 33% is endemic.

**[00:52:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you want to make great conservation and that conversation you have to take.

**[00:53:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to take care of the cloud forest.

**[00:53:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in JLO, the properties involved in these payments of carbon and remember no more cattle or chasels or forest fires.

**[00:53:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in blue, the commercial property outside the state of getting cattle.

**[00:53:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this pretty several as sorry, about the payments that are done every six months.

**[00:53:24] robertopedrazaruiz**
> People is getting 100% of their money for the carbon, not a small percentage with a carbon brokers and developers and all those pirates.

**[00:53:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And payments are done a very public way.

**[00:53:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They received a check in front of their fellow landowners.

**[00:53:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They can use the money they've decided themselves have to use their resources.

**[00:53:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We don't conditionate, you have to spend the money on this and this and this.

**[00:53:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> what is the main concern here?

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And part of this project is a wild land fire management.

**[00:54:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I grew up planting trees, now it's not possible longer.

**[00:54:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Longer possible because of the drought.

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Spring is the worst season in Mexico because of the latitude.

**[00:54:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It brings the drought, heat waves and the forest fires.

**[00:54:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> in a tree plant, firefighter tells the whole story about climate change, how real it is, it's changing our landscape and way of living.

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Then we set up a character of the two projects of the world and was worked as a reference, and it took

**[00:55:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Because three governors to make this really happen.

**[00:55:04] robertopedrazaruiz**
> 12 years ago, it was just a small tax on the vehicles.

**[00:55:12] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In 2020, the price of the world on tonscare served as an example.

**[00:55:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> finally, two years ago, the Canada State Congress approved a new law.

**[00:55:23] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Saudi industry basically my state have to pay carbon tax.

**[00:55:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a self-financing mechanism.

**[00:55:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's paying who is making the dirty business.

**[00:55:31] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And the funding is coming to share a order to pay first owners to offset the carbon emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**
> We've been doing this for a couple years now.

**[01:00:51] Alex Carlin**
> We did four countries where we did concerts and press conferences We did a cookie bar Ghana Togo and Benine.

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**
> best in Africa, I think, from Abi-John.

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's take a deep breath.

**[01:27:56] sustainavistas**
> Grant?

**[01:27:57] sustainavistas**
> Yeah, hi, guys.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**
> Sorry.

**[01:27:59] sustainavistas**

**[01:28:00] sustainavistas**
> inspiring.

**[01:28:01] sustainavistas**
> I have to say goodbye.

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**
> So when till we're going to have something and in the

**[01:29:00] sustainavistas**
> some of this is going to be an incredible party and things to celebrate in Amsterdam next year.

**[01:29:03] sustainavistas**
> So put that in your agenda, guys.

**[01:29:05] sustainavistas**
> And once again, thank you very much.

**[01:29:08] sustainavistas**
> And goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Goodbye everyone.

**[01:29:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Grant is coming fairly close to volunteering to chair our public events committee.

**[01:29:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we'll have to follow up on that.

**[01:29:22] sustainavistas**
> When there's a band, is banned, I love it.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:29:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm serious.

**[01:29:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:29:32] sustainavistas**
> Bye everyone.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> Okay.

**[01:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob has asked for as much time as he can possibly have to prepare his presentation.

**[01:29:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see his lips are moving as if he's he's he's preparing.

**[01:29:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to say let's take a few minutes and just introduce ourselves if we haven't already.

**[01:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My top row, everyone has been introduced.

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Look at that.

**[01:30:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:30:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Just hello and who you are so that people want to get in touch with the chair of the steering committee or our new vice president or Ananda, the author of several books on water, they know how to associate your face with your name.

**[01:30:32] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> How's that?

**[01:30:33] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> All right.

**[01:30:34] Ananda Fitzsimmons**

**[01:31:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Russ Spear, who brought us, Alex Carlin and our musical interlude, say hello.

**[01:31:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Or not.

**[01:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Marius.

**[01:31:47] Russ Speer**
> Hello.

**[01:31:49] Russ Speer**
> Hi, sorry.

**[01:31:50] Russ Speer**

**[01:31:52] Russ Speer**
> I just I just passed the invitation to come to Amsterdam on to Alex and his band.

**[01:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So wonderful.

**[01:32:01] Russ Speer**
> I mean, this is so amazing.

**[01:32:03] Russ Speer**
> All the different reports on the different projects.

**[01:32:07] Russ Speer**
> I think we got climate change, excuse me, not climate change, global warming on the run.

**[01:32:15] Russ Speer**
> There are actually several companies full, all of whom make great returns on the investment, and all of them who bring down huge amounts of carbon and mostly turn it into repurpose it into living carbon.

**[01:32:33] Russ Speer**
> Which, of course, we get enough living carbon off, things start cooling off, gets reasonable again.

**[01:32:41] Russ Speer**
> So lots of reasons for optimism.

**[01:32:44] Russ Speer**
> I should probably give a presentation in about a month or two.

**[01:32:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I look forward to that, Russ.

**[01:32:50] Russ Speer**
> Thank you.

**[01:32:51] Russ Speer**

### Mention 9: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 86086:*
```
**[00:00:13] Alex Carlin**
> I'm doing a lot of things in And in fact, I do want to mention while we have a second that I have a super important meeting about what we're doing in Ghana coming up in early August.

**[00:00:28] Alex Carlin**
> So I can, I'm really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:32] Alex Carlin**
> I only have about 30, 40 minutes before I have to get ready for that meeting.

**[00:00:37] Alex Carlin**
> So I just want to mention that up top that I might, I'm not being rude if I leave, I have to do something else.

**[00:00:44] Alex Carlin**
> But I'm really, really eager to hear what you guys are doing.

**[00:00:47] Alex Carlin**
> And if there's any chance to be super briefly about what my project is, that would be wonderful as well.

**[00:00:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, well, we'll begin with a brief round of introductions, just a sentence.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> or two.

**[00:01:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But then we'll ask you back to give us a presentation, if you like.

**[00:01:04] Alex Carlin**
> Well, that would be fantastic.

**[00:01:06] Alex Carlin**
> You mean a different day?

**[00:01:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:01:08] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, that'd be wonderful.

**[00:01:09] Alex Carlin**
> That'd be perfect.

**[00:01:10] Alex Carlin**
> Then I won't I won't disturb your agenda today.

**[00:01:13] Alex Carlin**
> So that's great.

**[00:01:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And speaking of which, I will now find my agenda for today.

**[00:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> Okay.

**[00:01:20] Alex Carlin**
> Excellent.

**[00:01:20] Alex Carlin**
> So you're John.

**[00:01:21] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, respects highly of you.

**[00:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> I love your title, by the way, Eco, if I can just blab while you're doing this.

**[00:01:29] Alex Carlin**
> Eco restoration is exactly what I'm into.

**[00:01:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Exactly.

**[00:01:34] Alex Carlin**
> We're focused on the ocean, as you know, the Russ George kind of stuff.

**[00:01:39] Alex Carlin**
> Of course.

**[00:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> Power, the plankton restoration is what we're focused on.

**[00:01:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now you shouldn't blab because I'm finding I'm having trouble finding the what I'm looking for on my screen.

**[00:01:52] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah, and go ahead.

**[00:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> Yeah.

**[00:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> So anyway, it's just it's super exciting that we have this thing called Africa will be the leader.

**[00:01:57] Alex Carlin**
> I can play the song right now.

**[00:01:58] Alex Carlin**
> That's it's led by a and.

**[00:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Some that we wrote that I wrote that it's like we are the world rather children, but it's not for charity It's it's showing Africa as the leader Not and you're not the victim But the leader because we've obviously been let down by the US and Europe and the leaders for the last 50 years But now Africa is the leader and that's what the songs about and that's what our actions are about got it It's pretty exciting Hello, hello grants.

**[00:02:31] Alex Carlin**
> Hello, Ananda Yeah, we're the early birds I also have to I also have to leave in 45 You're on for now in a half today 90 minutes.

**[00:02:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, it's typically it's it's two hours I'm gonna try to give myself an extra 10 minutes.

**[00:02:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a a meeting at next door I

**[00:03:00] sustainavistas**
> I'll do it later but I'll do it in the chat as well but I want to wish everybody happy by a diversity day today because it's a big one, it's the big big big one and we don't want to get too many of these commercial banking financial institutions coming up some derivative of how they can take 30 to 50% of all the money going to buy diversity and make profits again, right?

**[00:03:23] sustainavistas**
> The hedge funds kind of, yeah, we had quite a nice event on on Monday we had a biodiversity day with our new, we've just got a one hectare, we've launched a new one hectare garden and I actually showed Jake and on Saturday he was quite impressed the difference it's made.

**[00:03:40] sustainavistas**
> We've actually got a green desert where they just, we put up an insect hotel for we could have like a thousand solar tree, pollinators, bee, solar tree bees and in four months we haven't got one.

**[00:03:54] sustainavistas**
> this is the farm ex farm and that we've been given to to develop our community garden.

**[00:04:00] sustainavistas**
> and community you think.

**[00:04:02] sustainavistas**
> yeah, hi from Amsterdam.

**[00:04:04] sustainavistas**

**[00:10:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So permit me to say good morning to everyone.

**[00:10:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**

**[00:10:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am, uh, fortunately an echo restoration alliance member.

**[00:10:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And, um, a couple of times I've also had a privilege to be on the town hall meeting.

**[00:10:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is not my first.

**[00:10:52] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm glad that, um, that is, um, Samuel O'Shill is my name, um, currently in Nigeria.

**[00:10:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm in Nigeria.

**[00:11:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I'm also residing in Nigeria and I don't know if my screen is up.

**[00:11:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Can we see my screen?

**[00:11:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[00:11:07] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> just have to put three slide back here that I'll probably just speak to.

**[00:11:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I do quite a bit of things and part of what I do resonates with climate restoration, climate mitigation, climate adaptation and that is why I am particularly interested in for restoration activities across the African continent.

**[00:11:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am the president of the African network of green ambassadors.

**[00:11:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We are pushing forward green actions across 28 African countries as we speak at the moment and also happen to be the chairman of the Board of Sustainable Green Environment Initiative.

**[00:11:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The community of young individuals posturing the act of sustainability and green actions across African continent.

**[00:11:57] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I also happen to be part of the Green Building Council in Nigeria.

**[00:12:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I do a lot of advocacy in the climate change space.

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**

> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**

> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**
> Everything is done by gravity pushing water through and in and around all of these diverse ecosystems.

**[00:35:48] Cory Albers**
> And it's the extraction of the nutrients in there and the energy from the sun that is allowing for all of the transformation.

**[00:36:08] Cory Albers**
> Now, when we look in Nigeria, we are, from what Sandy and Konkonko have spoken of in the state of Enugu, this is speaking a little bit to the efforts we're engaged in in the state of oil, where there is a large city, the capital city is called Ibadan, and it's in and around the 3.5 million residents.

**[00:36:39] Cory Albers**
> And to its east, there is a reservoir on the Osun River, which is called the Asajari Reservoir.

**[00:36:48] Cory Albers**
> It is 32 million cubic meters, and it is one of the principal intended water supplies to the city of Ibadan.

**[00:37:00] Cory Albers**
> but it is the existing wastewater or water treatment plant is non-functional so what we're proposing to do is to bring exactly the kind of nature-based water treatment solution that I've seen on the last couple of slides to this space and we have a 36 hectare allocation of land just south of the existing water treatment plant that is sufficiently large in order to be able to treat 2,100 liters per second of water that would allow for the restoration of the water supply to the city of Imadoc.

**[00:38:01] Cory Albers**

**[00:38:11] Cory Albers**
> And therefore, it's an environment in which we can create these incredibly beautiful places.

**[00:38:17] Cory Albers**

**[00:38:35] Cory Albers**
> This is just showing some public parks examples in conceptual consideration here.

**[00:38:43] Cory Albers**
> But we also want to be able to create spaces where real profound and important human activities can happen.

**[00:38:52] Cory Albers**
> We can even create specific locations where ceremony can happen, such as weddings or

**[00:39:00] Cory Albers**
> recreation, and true connection between human beings can happen in these spaces.

**[00:39:11] Cory Albers**
> And in a place where certain types of ceremonies are celebrated, such as chief density installations, these are all just another set of conceptual examples of what we can create.

**[00:39:25] Cory Albers**
> So that the landscape becomes the place of worship.

**[00:39:31] Cory Albers**
> It's not a building where worship happens.

**[00:42:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:42:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is of course just from my own perspective, but Mara and I were involved in ENABLE.

**[00:43:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:43:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I sort of make making a difference.

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

**[00:58:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's under butterflies.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> species.

**[00:59:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We have a third Mexican boardface in Sierra Gorda.

**[00:59:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The six Mexican cat species from jaguars to margas, tree frogs, salamanders, the last colony of military macaws in central Mexico.

**[00:59:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The biggest woodpecker left in Mexico, the biggest was extinct thanks to the loggers, but in this region we have big fat oaks and dead oaks standing so these guys can find the a house, the migratory bird that came from the US and Canada.

**[00:59:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And I think that's my time.

**[00:59:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> I will pass now to David.

**[00:59:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your attention.

**[00:59:43] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And also just close, this big tree was the only tree in the pasture of my grandfather.

**[00:59:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> While my father sold the cattle, the old tree came and took the landscape again.

**[00:59:58] Alex Carlin**
> Thanks.

**[01:00:00] Alex Carlin**
> Amazing photos amazing images fantastic great speech.

**[01:00:04] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you So John I have like I can do it in one minute, and then is that okay?

**[01:00:12] Alex Carlin**
> John are you there?

**[01:00:15] Alex Carlin**
> Yes, Alex do it in one minute, and then we'll return to Sierra Gorda Yeah, here's 10 seconds of the chorus line of the song the anthem.

**[01:00:29] Alex Carlin**
> That's the leader Africa will be the leader Africa will be the leader in the climate solution today Yeah, there's a climate solution today And I pray because leading the way Okay, really briefly.

**[01:00:49] Alex Carlin**
> We've been doing this for a couple years now.

**[01:00:51] Alex Carlin**
> We did four countries where we did concerts and press conferences We did a cookie bar Ghana Togo and Benine.

**[01:00:58] Alex Carlin**
> I have an incredible reggae band

**[01:01:00] Alex Carlin**
> best in Africa, I think, from Abi-John.

**[01:01:03] Alex Carlin**
> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Two weeks later, it will be 9 p.m.

**[00:08:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's to accommodate people from various parts of the world.

**[00:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The agenda is in, whoops, the agenda will be in the chat again in a moment.

**[00:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Philip often helps with note-taking.

**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Philip.

**[00:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see he's already begun the process.

**[00:08:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And.

**[00:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We usually begin with introductions, but because.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a full schedule and we have several different groups here that are pressed for time.

**[00:09:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to begin with a couple of presentations about recent projects.

**[00:09:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, do we have Samni Konkanko and Corey here at this time?

**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And should we wait for Corey?

**[00:09:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Hello?

**[00:09:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Hello?

**[00:09:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm on the phone.

**[00:09:29] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Oh, okay.

**[00:09:31] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's good to be here today.

**[00:09:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[00:09:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:09:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, we will begin with an update from Samni Konkanko, Corey, who are working on water and Nigeria.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How's that?

**[00:09:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> who begins?

**[00:09:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> According to my notes, Samni is introducing them, but Mabel Michael wants to introduce them.

**[00:09:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll let you take it from here.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> take it away.

**[00:10:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Hello, Sam, you're on mute.

**[00:10:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Okay.

**[00:10:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Um, it's, um, afternoon from Nigeria.

**[00:10:17] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I believe it's morning for the majority of us on the call.

**[00:10:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So permit me to say good morning to everyone.

**[00:10:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Um, morning.

**[00:10:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's great to be here today.

**[00:10:30] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'll just I'll briefly, uh, give us another view of who I am.

**[00:10:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am, uh, fortunately an echo restoration alliance member.

**[00:10:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And, um, a couple of times I've also had a privilege to be on the town hall meeting.

**[00:10:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is not my first.

**[00:10:52] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm glad that, um, that is, um, Samuel O'Shill is my name, um, currently in Nigeria.

**[00:10:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I'm in Nigeria.

**[00:11:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I'm also residing in Nigeria and I don't know if my screen is up.

**[00:11:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Can we see my screen?

**[00:11:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[00:11:07] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> just have to put three slide back here that I'll probably just speak to.

**[00:11:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I do quite a bit of things and part of what I do resonates with climate restoration, climate mitigation, climate adaptation and that is why I am particularly interested in for restoration activities across the African continent.

**[00:11:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I am the president of the African network of green ambassadors.

**[00:11:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We are pushing forward green actions across 28 African countries as we speak at the moment and also happen to be the chairman of the Board of Sustainable Green Environment Initiative.

**[00:11:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The community of young individuals posturing the act of sustainability and green actions across African continent.

**[00:11:57] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I also happen to be part of the Green Building Council in Nigeria.

**[00:12:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> and I do a lot of advocacy in the climate change space.

**[00:12:03] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So that just a little bit about me, I'll have what we have ahead of us today is to talk about ecological restoration, the African way.

**[00:12:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> To better with a couple of my friends that we have been working together in this for the past, I would say over six to eight months now, just talking about the conceptualization and also where we have gotten at the moment, this has been a beautiful journey so far, and we've been able to make some strides.

**[00:12:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And from the equal restoration alliance, we've gotten quite an enormous support to be able to foster this action and we are very, very grateful for how far we have come.

**[00:12:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> My screen, the remote, okay, beautiful.

**[00:12:54] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So now the beautiful thing I want to talk to us about today is basically some of the...

**[00:13:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> that we are embarking on, and one of which is the smart and great school that we have in Anugustit, Nigeria.

**[00:13:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Before the end of last year, yes, myself and Jake, I don't know if we hold my Jake.

**[00:13:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jake is part of the era family as well.

**[00:13:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We had a trip to Anugustit, which was partly also supported by the Declaration Alliance, and the project that we have ongoing within this space is developing together with the government of Anugustit, a robust, smart and great school that incorporates experiential learning and incorporates every aspect of regenerative agricultural into the scheme of this book curriculum.

**[00:13:53] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So, there used to be a curriculum back in the days.

**[00:13:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> But right now, going forward.

**[00:14:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> the entirety of the state is adopting a newer curriculum that is going to be, that is currently, is being led by Dr.

**[00:14:08] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara, right?

**[00:14:09] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I know a couple of us might also know Dr.

**[00:14:11] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara as part of an active member.

**[00:14:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to change the tide of the way education has been through.

**[00:14:21] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Now we're going to be having a regenerative way and we're going to be having expression letting go alongside with it.

**[00:14:27] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We're going to be having indigenous wisdom, indigenous knowledge, incorporated in the way and manner by which the school system would now be operated.

**[00:14:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And part of what the picture looks like, I just put in a few things here, know probably we might have ratio.

**[00:14:46] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The smart and the spreadsheet board is located in every classroom.

**[00:14:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The pilot project is actually hosting about 800 to 1,000 who peers and students as we speak.

**[00:15:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> which is a very, very large size that is very impactful.

**[00:15:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> A lot of students and pupils within the villages and metropolitan within this school now come to school.

**[00:15:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Without paying the day, they have opportunity to be able to experience all of the extents that I have put in here as a feature.

**[00:15:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Robotic laboratory is incorporated in the school.

**[00:15:26] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Sustainable development goes practical, however, incorporated as part of the curriculum in the school.

**[00:15:32] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We have virtual reality exploration lab laboratory that is part of this school.

**[00:15:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Of course, the internet is also top notch that is also incorporated in part of the school.

**[00:15:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then I put in here it's to 100, 100 students accommodating capacity.

**[00:15:50] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And as we speak, we already have over it's 100 students in that school.

**[00:15:55] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it is 100 percent solar power.

**[00:15:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And it's a great

**[00:16:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> head smart staff for task is also a part of the school and the one of the most intriguing one that is very fascinating to me is the one actor regenerative agricultural farm land that is allocated to each school.

**[00:16:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Needless not to mention that this particular school is supposed to be looking to be about 260 of it because what we're working on right now is the pilot projects like the pilot study once this one is formed up properly then the remaining two era of 59 would be located in the different local government and wards within the states and for all the 260 there would be one actor of regenerative agricultural farm land that is dedicated to each of these schools and what that means is that these two events and groupies will have opportunity to be able to interact directly with the farm land because they are meant for them.

**[00:17:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> for learning and also for them to be able to have a business mind as to bringing the proceeds from some of this farmland and interacting directly with the local market, selling it to the local market and interacting with this.

**[00:17:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's going to be a very fascinating one and that's already an ongoing position within the space.

**[00:17:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Then there is going bogus energy generation integration also incorporated and of course for Kintagatian employee group kids there is a COVID zone that's already allocated for them.

**[00:17:37] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The capacity building and training of smart school which I have already initially said is led by Dr.

**[00:17:43] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Mara and we have also incorporated which assess for disabled.

**[00:17:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> I happen to be the technical lead for certification and training at the Green Building Council in Nigeria and I think I mentioned that initially I represent Green Building Council in Nigeria as well and I am also trying to incorporate that

**[00:18:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> from my leadership school, an aspect of making sure that the way and manner by which the entirety of the school is constructed on the goals, a form of sustainability measures, so that the school is green, both in and out.

**[00:18:15] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The manner by which the school is put into the operational week by which the school is run.

**[00:18:20] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's also a very fascinating and beautiful thing.

**[00:18:23] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And there are green areas.

**[00:18:25] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> one of the interesting things is that the second trip that we had to this particular school has also mandated the initial based water treatment solution that will be incorporated in this school.

**[00:18:39] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So it's a fascinating one.

**[00:18:41] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> am excited already about the project and optimistic and open that everyone will come along with us as we embark on the meeting is in joining.

**[00:18:51] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> It's supposed to be a prototype, something that probably will be able to be kept scale and be able to see how we can incorporate all of these.

**[00:19:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> to give Africa, and also even beyond.

**[00:19:04] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And just to give us what the picture looks like while we're there, I put in some few pieces to that.

**[00:19:12] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> The first picture of my right, my left, is you will see Jack right in the middle together with the honorable commissioner for education in Enogustiites and myself, at the other side of it, and some of the vibrant women that are also leading the charge for this particular innovation and initiative.

**[00:19:33] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And down below it is we have touched down on the school.

**[00:19:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is the school premises.

**[00:19:40] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So this is the pilot's school.

**[00:19:42] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And here you will see, yeah, you will see courage, you see myself, you see of council here, at the exact same location in Enogustiites and some of the principal officers from the Ministry of Education.

**[00:20:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education in Enugu and also together with the Ministry of Water Resources because we are also integrating these two efforts together and of course we are having a conversation with the Ministry of Agriculture as well to be able to collaborate and work together on this journey.

**[00:20:16] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So to my right you would see above there we are in the Chief, the Chief's Palace.

**[00:20:22] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> So we're not just doing this from the political angle alone, we are also incorporating Indigenous knowledge and we are interacting directly with the local leaders to be able to come along in the project so that the project is sustainable and it's not just politically driven but it is politically driven but it is people enabled so that we can have any more sustainability on the project and here in the middle is the Chief for the land in all over where the school is located and so my right is the Honorable Commission of Water Resources.

**[00:20:59] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> We've seen Honorable Commission of

**[00:21:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> education initially, here is the honorable permission for water resources that is also a part of the journey.

**[00:21:06] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> see myself, see, when you see Corey also alongside and the regional coordinator for the indigenous people is the one on the eastern left and you would see us visit some of the sites water and even when you're looking at the water you see it's so tall bit and the next picture we show us what exactly these people are doing with this water that you probably would think is not drinkable.

**[00:21:34] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> Here we have it.

**[00:21:36] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is exactly what happens.

**[00:21:38] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> You see people bathing in the water and you see them washing clothes in the water, see them doing a lot of things.

**[00:21:44] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This water is a means of their livelihood.

**[00:21:47] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> This is what they depend on.

**[00:21:48] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> However, because of the topography of the nature of this particular area, it's difficult for them to even get clean and possible water to drink.

**[00:21:58] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> And that's why we are looking at the initial basis.

**[00:22:00] Dr. Sanmi Olowosile**
> solution trying to see how we can use it like that for them to be able to get potable water to drink and you can see here the same water which in which the bath in which they used to wash clothes you can see we'll borrow and can call it a gallon for them to take that water through their respective homes and allow a wait for the water to settle before they utilize it for cooking it and drinking and all of the salt so it's going to be a very impactful project and we are open and optimistic about the impact that this project is going to bring so at this point I want to thank everybody for listening to me and we'll be liking to pass the button on to go come to our current conversation thank you thank you Sami so my name is Konkanko

**[00:23:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's not my first time on Town Hall either.

**[00:23:05] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I'm an indigenous elder from Bafur Kingdom.

**[00:23:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's treated in the northwest region of Cameroon.

**[00:23:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I am founder and coordinator of two regenerative youth and women organizations.

**[00:23:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> One is very well Cameroon.

**[00:23:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> registered in 1996 as a youth and environment.

**[00:23:35] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Strategy to support the government program.

**[00:23:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it grew to become an industry for the global equity network in Africa.

**[00:23:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And there the World Cameroon was followed here in Portugal because of the crisis in Cameroon.

**[00:23:57] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I try to replicate and create.

**[00:24:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> who create an organization called African We.

**[00:24:04] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's mostly focused on refugee and immigrants.

**[00:24:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we've succeeded to bring the indigenous wisdom here such that this project has become a welcome center also for the Erasmus plus program here in Portugal.

**[00:24:30] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So the organization I have mentioned was running a base, a land base for land base entrepreneurship that is Bafud Eco Village.

**[00:24:50] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And the Bafud Eco Village was founded in 2021.

**[00:24:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And in three years.

**[00:25:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It won't be Guaya Trust Award of the most inspiring project in Africa.

**[00:25:09] Joshua Konkankoh**
> This probably, it's probably a bit about my background.

**[00:25:16] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I did something called environmental journalism and went on to work in government.

**[00:25:23] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the Social Security Department for 22 years as a public information officer in charge of safety at workplaces, water and sanitation in companies and schools.

**[00:25:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And since that time, I found that the youth, the education they were receiving from the universities.

**[00:25:58] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Medium last year.

**[00:26:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> because they easily cut off from the natural roots of living with nature-based solutions on the land and they start dreaming about Europe.

**[00:26:11] Joshua Konkankoh**
> It's not just because I'm one of the refugees now in Europe, but this project went on to expose many of the issues around these troubled areas in the Congo, Congo in Cameroon and the ambisonian situation.

**[00:26:33] Joshua Konkankoh**
> The people who have resources are usually victims of their own resources and then usually are left on the sidelines of community and international development.

**[00:26:46] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So my work here in Europe has been focused on how these are on tap to resource.

**[00:26:55] Joshua Konkankoh**
> These are people from all over the world who come in with Indigenous

**[00:27:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> skills, a lot of wisdom, but have no identity and cannot participate, having really concerned that these people, this category are not regarded in restoration projects, and there is a huge demand for language generation, and water issues.

**[00:27:32] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I take our example of the work that we've done in developing water catchments and dealing with tree planting, I was involved in the billion tree program in Cameroon, and have been involved with many tree programs in Cameroon, and recently was on a trip in India to see

**[00:28:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> how they do it in the, in regenerating the rural indigenous communities.

**[00:28:06] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And it's been a big lesson joining uh source to source.

**[00:28:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> In the source to source, um co-designers, uh, is mentioned on how we bring the indigenous wisdom.

**[00:28:24] Joshua Konkankoh**
> We believe that it is easier to build children than broken men.

**[00:28:31] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And we have a lot of broken men leading the restoration and regeneration agendas.

**[00:28:39] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Um, that said, believe also that this kind of network weaving that Sami mentioned that I was part of in Inugo where both young women, the government, are joining hands together.

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> And I

**[00:29:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I see in this just maybe an example of what era is looking at regionalism in terms of experiential learning.

**[00:29:12] Joshua Konkankoh**
> I believe that if we are going to do something about the climate and about restoration, that the African drum has a CM is in the hall.

**[00:29:27] Joshua Konkankoh**
> and I believe he knows something about the African drum of how it's maybe crucial for this part of the darkness which might have some solutions.

**[00:29:42] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So this is my informed reason for being in sauce to sauce because these people that are left on the sidelines are actually the ones who on their day-to-day lives are in touch with

**[00:30:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> the nature of the solutions that we are talking about and that we somehow need to channel this resource to inform the way that we are trying also to restore modernization and especially the so-called global sub-separation.

**[00:30:40] Joshua Konkankoh**
> My work has been focused on this area trying to look at how this kind of bottom-up programs that are resufflicing in Africa could also contribute in the South

**[00:31:00] Joshua Konkankoh**
> North partnerships.

**[00:31:02] Joshua Konkankoh**
> Since COVID, I have realized how impactful it is when you get young people in the Global South and young people in the Global North working together.

**[00:31:14] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I created an organization called Indigenous and Modern and it just went around universities like wildfire.

**[00:31:26] Joshua Konkankoh**
> So I think one of the programs that this the school and community initiated in Africa is demonstrating is the way that community university research can be articulated such that the young researchers are not just doing the research in the comfort of their university desk but actually go down into the communities and put their finger on their knees that are concerned with this.

**[00:33:00] Cory Albers**
> I'll give you a little bit more, pardon me, perspective on who we are, we did big things in the water and in Canada we have been the principal design engineer for hydraulic engineering and water resources for some of the largest water waste water systems in Western Canada.

**[00:33:21] Cory Albers**
> They're genuinely large and you know one thing you see in this image is you know aside from the size is just there's not a lot of green in it and I call this gray infrastructure, it's a very commonly referred to thing is to say gray infrastructure which treats our water and deals with our water but in many ways this doesn't fill my heart so I still do this because it fills a need and is important but

**[00:34:00] Cory Albers**
> About 20 years ago, started to move into the green infrastructure space, we now have developed many technologies and have abundant examples of completed projects, where we've become award-winning designers of nature-based water treatment projects in Western Canada.

**[00:34:29] Cory Albers**
> And, you know, this is what fills my heart, and I know it fills the hearts of others, because when I walk through these facilities and see other people walking through them and engaging in them, their spirits are lifted.

**[00:34:46] Cory Albers**
> And that, you know, lives my spirits, along with them, to see that we're creating spaces that not only provide water treatment in plain sight, but also,

**[00:35:00] Cory Albers**
> allow for people to interact with beautiful environments that are diverse rich ecosystems.

**[00:35:10] Cory Albers**
> And this is an example that our flagship project in camp or in Calgary.

**[00:35:15] Cory Albers**
> Just some promotional video here that I'll just roll while I'm talking.

**[00:35:22] Cory Albers**
> And you can see the richness of the biodiversity in here.

**[00:35:26] Cory Albers**
> We have large spaces that are powered.

**[00:35:32] Cory Albers**
> In this case there's not a bit of electricity that exists on the site.

**[00:35:37] Cory Albers**

**[00:49:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In our case, agricultural and cow ranching have led forest barns, landslides, dry creeks, forest fires, and poverty.

**[00:49:14] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So what to keep doing the same?

**[00:49:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin years ago to try to convert CO2 as a conservation asset for local communities and forest owners, because every piece of these mountains has a local owner and without another income, they will keep slashing and burning the forest and stay poor.

**[00:49:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we begin the calculation, the methodology, I work for the group, because here at Gordon, I'm in church of a network of private nature reserves within this mountains landscape and also a wildlife photographer.

**[00:50:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So that green area is where the Sierra Gordon is based, of the Eastern Sierra Madre, is the most eco diverse protected area, because it's a advisory reserve, and remember that San Mexico is one of the top 10 mega diverse countries in the world, so it's really piece of cake this mountains and by a local diversity day, the carbo.

**[00:50:34] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:51:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's the difference between one protected without cattle and the right side, one overgraced without junk trees or understory, eliminating a whole layer of the forest and damaging biodiversity.

**[00:51:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And planting corn in these mountains is nonsense because their bare-steep slopes, they best more work and money than actually crops, they're getting and not even self-sufficient.

**[00:51:30] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we need to give value and the real income to local forest owners to change that evil scheme.

**[00:51:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So with the world and trust, we develop a first project.

**[00:51:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Based on our local calculations of how much carbon is storing the forest and how much increases removing cattle and chainsaws.

**[00:51:52] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Also logging has done a lot of damage to these best trees are gone, but still a very nice forest.

**[00:51:59] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So in hilly plants,

**[00:52:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It's a list of the sea, on the east side of the Sierra Gorda, we're working with four different Hidos, which are coming up properly.

**[00:52:06] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They're indigenous people of the Navajo Native Americans.

**[00:52:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Almost 5,000 hectares of forest were no more land clearance, no logging, and no use of fire.

**[00:52:17] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that force really, a piece of cake, and these friends are respecting the view, and the force is doing great.

**[00:52:26] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And then within the Sierra Gorda, additional work with 26 private owners, one Hido, protecting 2,500 hectares between the nature reserves.

**[00:52:41] robertopedrazaruiz**
> In green are the private nature reserves, we're protecting mostly cloud forest.

**[00:52:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Why cloud forest?

**[00:52:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> cloud forest is covered less than 1% in Mexico.

**[00:52:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They covered 12% of the explorer, and 33% is endemic.

**[00:52:56] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:53:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> to take care of the cloud forest.

**[00:53:02] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in JLO, the properties involved in these payments of carbon and remember no more cattle or chasels or forest fires.

**[00:53:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And in blue, the commercial property outside the state of getting cattle.

**[00:53:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this pretty several as sorry, about the payments that are done every six months.

**[00:53:24] robertopedrazaruiz**
> People is getting 100% of their money for the carbon, not a small percentage with a carbon brokers and developers and all those pirates.

**[00:53:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And payments are done a very public way.

**[00:53:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They received a check in front of their fellow landowners.

**[00:53:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They can use the money they've decided themselves have to use their resources.

**[00:53:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We don't conditionate, you have to spend the money on this and this and this.

**[00:53:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now it's part of their you the gentleman here is there.

**[00:54:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They both there, and they decided to save the money to build water tanks.

**[00:54:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And that's very nice because the drought is destroying Mexico.

**[00:54:09] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Now we are under the clear heat wave in an already very bad landscape.

**[00:54:16] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:54:20] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:54:33] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:54:53] robertopedrazaruiz**

> Directors and small staff, the states are soon.

**[00:55:46] robertopedrazaruiz**
> We hope we'll be running out of forest and we'll have to work outside the data to offset emissions of these companies.

**[00:55:51] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first project that we present to the state government past year, it's almost 8,000 characters of forest.

**[00:56:00] robertopedrazaruiz**

**[00:56:03] robertopedrazaruiz**
> You remember the first map, dark green there, serves, yellow and blue, the world on trust, and then the additional surface.

**[00:56:11] robertopedrazaruiz**
> And this area here was very nice because the local community there got approved a login by government.

**[00:56:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The first meeting I went there to offer the carbon payments, the loggers were already there discussing the price of the timber and of course as an as usual robbing the local people.

**[00:56:32] robertopedrazaruiz**
> After while I have a chance to present the idea and the local ladies were very important.

**[00:56:37] robertopedrazaruiz**
> They said we don't want the logging, we're concerned about the creeks, were for our kids and we preferred the forest.

**[00:56:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> It took a while but we took off the logging permit and these 2000 hectares of forest with big fat oaks are staying there and they got three to one the amount of money the loggers were offering so very nice.

**[00:57:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> and this year we hope to get approved the second project and you can see the difference how the forest protected is increasing, how the local people is making far more money than the traditional activities and how this is changing the economy, society and the environment in Sierra Galois.

**[00:57:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> This is a bit of the landscape we're trying to protect and that's what we call it carbonobio from the high desert to highlands with Douglas person aspains and here's a big Mexican agave so you don't forget you're in Mexico not in Canada the cold fronts I love to chase the the bad weather the cold fronts that rain the storms where you can make the best landscape photography and this is the type of temporary forest where protecting remember that Mexico is the richest country in oak the richest country in pine like this big guy and here's a fur and we need this forest to stay there to ensure the aquatic catchment for the people here

**[00:58:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> The tropical forest in the lowlands, the riparian forest, sadly, is image of history, because now this beautiful river is completely dry, and this big old-growth cypress are dead, because of the drought and the heat waves.

**[00:58:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we were not acting fast enough to protect these beautiful places, then the cloud forest is one of the reserves.

**[00:58:22] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Before we protected, the logger were trying to make charcoal of the big oaks, and the wildlife were protected in microendemic salamanders, and this is what happened when you take out cattle.

**[00:58:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That forest used to be a pasture of my grandfather, was a cow branch around here, and just by taking out the cattle, not planting a single tree, you have the systems growing away again.

**[00:58:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So my point is, even in this forest state, we have nature, if you take human pressure off, she can still kill herself.

> It's called the Africa Climate Band.

**[01:01:05] Alex Carlin**
> And we're doing this and we're focused on the big picture, eco-restoration, but in the ocean, the plankton ecosystems, that that's where most of photosynthesis happens on our planet.

**[01:01:18] Alex Carlin**
> That's what can actually make it so it won't be too hot to work.

**[01:01:22] Alex Carlin**
> It won't, and they also do the acid.

**[01:01:24] Alex Carlin**
> They take care of acidification in the ocean, so there won't be too much acid for the fish to survive.

**[01:01:30] Alex Carlin**
> Those are the two big issues.

**[01:01:31] Alex Carlin**
> We're on the big picture, and that's, and I would love to do a presentation two weeks from now and explain more.

**[01:01:38] Alex Carlin**
> But that's it.

**[01:01:40] Alex Carlin**
> All right.

**[01:01:41] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you so much, John.

**[01:01:43] Alex Carlin**
> This is really exciting.

**[01:01:44] Alex Carlin**
> Oh, just in the first week of August, we're going to film it with stars.

**[01:01:47] Alex Carlin**
> Like we are the world where they had cameo, like, you know, Michael Jackson sang a line in Bruce Spring.

**[01:01:53] Alex Carlin**
> We're having African stars singing lines.

**[01:01:55] Alex Carlin**
> So if any of you guys out there know some African singing stars.

**[01:01:59] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> We want out.

**[01:02:00] Alex Carlin**
> Many of them just thing one line in our video.

**[01:02:03] Alex Carlin**
> making August and early August and then editing and putting it out all over Africa Alex, please would please put your email in the chat so we can follow up.

**[01:02:13] Alex Carlin**
> We'll see you in two weeks.

**[01:02:14] Alex Carlin**
> Thank you Don't thank you so much.

**[01:02:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's been great Sorry, I hit the mute button a moment too soon.

**[01:02:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see you in two weeks Alex Okay, back to Sierra, Georgia.

**[01:02:32] David Ross**
> are you next?

**[01:02:33] David Ross**
> Yes, I'm next.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Yeah.

**[01:02:34] David Ross**
> Thank you very much Alex for that great great music and Congratulations to the Africa team for their great work.

**[01:02:41] David Ross**
> So I'm going to follow up on the presentation by Roberto Pidrasa and explain in a little more detail the financing Mechanisms that are being used that could perhaps be used directly or

**[01:03:00] David Ross**
> adapted for the Equal Restoration Alliance initiative in Panama.

**[01:03:07] David Ross**
> So the state with support of the group at the local Sierra Gorda and in others, the state of Colorado in Mexico adopted adopted a greenhouse gas tax that businesses that operate in the state have to pay.

**[01:03:30] David Ross**
> And it is based upon their emissions of greenhouse gases under what was referred to as scope one emissions which are direct emissions from the businesses that operate within the state as well as scope two emissions emissions that result from their use of electricity and and other power.

**[01:03:53] David Ross**
> And so the businesses have an obligation to quantify what their emissions agree.

**[01:04:00] David Ross**
> greenhouse gases are from their operations within the state of Coratero.

**[01:04:06] David Ross**
> And the state of Coratero has imposed a greenhouse gas tax that those businesses have to pay.

**[01:04:18] David Ross**
> And this is others at a national level and some other states have also had some greenhouse gas taxes.

**[01:04:25] David Ross**
> What was really unique about the state of Coratero is that it adopted a compensation system, which allows those businesses to reduce their tax obligation, their greenhouse gas obligation, up to 20% by obtaining carbon offsets, carbon concessions from approved projects.

**[01:04:54] David Ross**
> And they have given priority to the

**[01:05:00] David Ross**
> project of biodiverse carbon of the group of logical chiaragorna.

**[01:05:06] David Ross**
> Other projects can also enter, but they have given priority to that project.

**[01:05:12] David Ross**
> And so as part of their, so their tasks just to give you an idea, this year it will be equivalent to approximately $35 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.

**[01:05:27] David Ross**
> And so, and the sort of businesses have the option of obtaining carbon compensations from an approved project to reduce their tax obligation by up to 20%.

**[01:05:40] David Ross**
> And as part of their, of this emission compensation system, the state of collateral identified carbon programs or protocols that will be considered eligible.

**[01:05:57] David Ross**
> And in addition to their traditional internships,

**[01:06:00] David Ross**
> national carbon offset programs and protocols, they also explicitly accept the local protocol of sub-national actions for the regeneration of landscapes that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and developed as part of a nationally appropriate mitigation action.

**[01:06:23] David Ross**
> So for those of you who know about these carbon offsets that are being used in international carbon markets, you may know that they have some advantages and that they have some disadvantages.

**[01:06:38] David Ross**
> I am on the disadvantages is that sometimes a very large amount of the money never winds up in the hands of the landowners but winds up in the hands of intermediates and there are other characteristics that the group of echolopecosia are ignored and they term were not appropriate for rural areas of poverty in

**[01:07:00] David Ross**
> Mexico.

**[01:07:01] David Ross**
> And so we developed a local protocol that we believe is better.

**[01:07:07] David Ross**
> And the state of Caratrol was fully cooperative with the development of that local protocol and accepts it for its compensation system.

**[01:07:17] David Ross**
> So I'm just going to give just a brief description of what the key characteristics are about local protocol and how it differs from international carbon credit projects.

**[01:07:27] David Ross**
> One is that the local protocol requires that the project be operated by a non-government organization that has at least three years of experience working in the area, working on the ground with the local with the local communities.

**[01:07:49] David Ross**
> Or if it's a new NGO, they should have personnel, they should have people working for them that have at least

**[01:08:00] David Ross**
> three years of experience working in the area and working on the ground with the local people and the local community.

**[01:08:09] David Ross**
> Also, the local protocol requires that the project component operate with a maximum of 20% of the income from the sale of the carbon offsets, meaning that at least 80% of the income must, it should be dedicated to the landowners, to the local people, to the local communities.

**[01:08:39] David Ross**
> And so this is very different from international protocols where sometimes, you know, only 20% or in some cases in the first years none of it goes to the local people.

**[01:08:50] David Ross**
> But under our protocol, it is a requirement that 80% of that money at least must go to the local people.

**[01:09:00] David Ross**
> In addition, so some of the key eligibility requirements.

**[01:09:07] David Ross**
> In addition, we also have adopted measures to reduce the costs because international protocols have good intention, but sometimes it results in very high costs for implementing and monitoring.

**[01:09:26] David Ross**
> And so under the local protocol, we permit the use of default removal factors that are accepted and published internationally or nationally, or you can develop your own local removal factors based upon the implementation of local monitoring.

**[01:09:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And what does removal factor mean, David?

**[01:09:56] David Ross**
> It, that means when.

**[01:10:00] David Ross**
> in a forest, how much carbon dioxide equivalent is being removed from the atmosphere per hectare per year.

**[01:10:15] David Ross**
> That's the removal factor.

**[01:10:19] David Ross**
> And so we permit, as I mentioned, international default factors, national default factors, or the development of local default factors.

**[01:10:28] David Ross**
> And if you will, and also permitting the establishment of monitoring sites to improve those factors.

**[01:10:40] David Ross**
> And that is less expensive than the very intensive and very expensive monitoring requirements of the international protocols.

**[01:10:52] David Ross**
> So that's just a brief summary of the financial mechanism.

**[01:10:56] David Ross**
> It's the greenhouse gas tax with a compensation.

**[01:11:00] David Ross**
> system in combination with a local protocol that's designed specifically for the conditions of rural areas in areas of poverty.

**[01:11:11] David Ross**
> And we are now adapting this local protocol so that it can be used by others.

**[01:11:20] David Ross**
> And so if any of you in your initiative in Panama or in other parts of the world are interested in using this local protocol as an alternative to those expensive international carbon credit protocols, this is going to be an option.

**[01:11:41] David Ross**
> And we are establishing an official registry for the registration of projects that are going to use this local protocol.

**[01:11:53] David Ross**
> And I'm going to pass the pass the word to Alexander Watson from

**[01:12:00] David Ross**
> open forest who is helping us to develop their registry who can explain that in a little more detail.

**[01:12:07] Alexander Watson**
> Thank you, Ross, and thank you for the invitation to this very interesting forum.

**[01:12:15] Alexander Watson**
> In the next five to six minutes, I will be again a little bit deeper so we started quite broad and now we're getting more specifically and I will explain the technicalities of such a registry.

**[01:12:36] Alexander Watson**
> So I'm going to share my screen now.

**[01:12:43] Alexander Watson**
> I think you can see it now.

**[01:12:47] Alexander Watson**
> If that's the case.

**[01:12:50] Alexander Watson**
> Yes, okay, perfect.

**[01:12:53] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, so I will run you now through the registry and the technicalities but

**[01:13:00] Alexander Watson**
> just a few slides before.

**[01:13:02] Alexander Watson**
> He's again a summary also of what Ross mentioned, so the protocol is complementary to existing standards.

**[01:13:13] Alexander Watson**
> It is inclusive because it gives access to the local communities, and I think what's also interesting is that it has a landscape design possibility, I call it here, because often standards are designed for one project, certain systematic, and it basically allows to onboard every year, a new project.

**[01:13:41] Alexander Watson**
> Also, as Robert showed you very nicely on the map, how the project is growing, and you don't need to start from scratch, so you can onboard continuously in your land owners to it.

**[01:14:00] Alexander Watson**
> this out because I just want to show how large it is.

**[01:14:03] Alexander Watson**
> So 380 hectares, just the project region and it might grow beyond.

**[01:14:09] Alexander Watson**
> So this is really a huge potential that it has for an initiative that's just starting.

**[01:14:19] Alexander Watson**
> I put this screen here to show also the effect the project already has on the landscape.

**[01:14:26] Alexander Watson**
> Basically on the left side in the white polygon you see the Sierra Gorda location and outside.

**[01:14:35] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, basically this is an area that's not under this management or not influenced by this management and we activate here the tree cover loss and you see that there's a significant difference between inside the project and outside.

**[01:14:50] Alexander Watson**
> So yeah, also these are the carbon-fixing sections.

**[01:15:00] Alexander Watson**
> Extrasion factors, so there's not just one factor for the entire Sierra Gorda, so there are different forest types which have different carbon uptake potential, which work as a proxy in the first stage, but of course there's on the ground monitoring here by Java and others from the Sierra Gorda team who really do sample plot based monitoring in the field.

**[01:15:29] Alexander Watson**
> So how it actually works is that a farmer or landowner is onboarded to their property, and a property can include different land use types, forest types with different carbon sequestration rates, then basically the carbon storage per year, per property is calculated, so which is a quite consistent methodology to build up.

**[01:16:00] Alexander Watson**
> this calm inventory, which then might be eligible for a transaction.

**[01:16:09] Alexander Watson**
> To administrate it and make it very transparent, there is an inventory block serial code, so each inventory has a unique code, so consisting of the last store, the country, ID, state ID, the property ID, the vintage year, and then the amount of calm that has been stored, so that there's a very transparent and clear administration of how to manage the calm stock in a database.

**[01:16:41] Alexander Watson**
> And after such an inventory has been calculated, and there's a company that has these obligations to either pay taxes or buy calm offsets to compensate for their emissions, they can

**[01:17:00] Alexander Watson**
> do a transaction and I think what's also attractive or let's say from the methodological point of view is that it's an on-the-side compensation.

**[01:17:11] Alexander Watson**
> So as a company inside of Kereitaro, you compensate inside of Kereitaro and not as I brought in in other webinars.

**[01:17:21] Alexander Watson**
> So you have like a Pete land in basically you destroy the land, the wetland of a frog and then you can compensate with carbon credits in a dry land forest in So I think that's also quite important as back to have local on-site compensation.

**[01:17:40] Alexander Watson**
> Yeah, this is just a screenshot with some blurred information because it's already operational.

**[01:17:46] Alexander Watson**
> transaction already have happened and it's currently built out towards a full professional grade registry with an later stage also.

**[01:18:00] Alexander Watson**
> will connect it or has a possibility to connect to other databases and systems, so such as the state directly.

**[01:18:10] Alexander Watson**
> This is just an example of how it works, so we have these transaction map in the database, and I will not go into details how that works, but what's also planned is beside, let's say, the factors, the underground monitoring, that there's also a continuous remote sensing based monitoring, so what you see here, here the transaction in this box down here, and they are associated to a property, so the car is linked to a property, then can be of course monitored in remote sensing activity, so with different data layers through exploit.land, and this is just an example, so this is a property that's under the management and

**[01:19:00] Alexander Watson**
> And you see satellite imagery from 2017.

**[01:19:05] Alexander Watson**
> And if you go back and forth where you see the arrow, so there has been some deforestation happening there.

**[01:19:13] Alexander Watson**
> And even more deforestation happening to 2023.

**[01:19:18] Alexander Watson**
> And this deforestation then could also be confirmed through the data layer.

**[01:19:22] Alexander Watson**
> So fortunately, not inside of the area.

**[01:19:26] Alexander Watson**
> But it's a very simple but quite effective way to monitor such projects with this existing data.

**[01:19:37] Alexander Watson**
> So again, not causing a lot of additional costs because the data is already available.

**[01:19:43] Alexander Watson**
> In this case, it comes from Global Forest Watch and the planet.

**[01:19:48] Alexander Watson**
> That's it.

**[01:19:49] Alexander Watson**
> I will send around the presentation here in the chat.

**[01:19:54] Alexander Watson**
> So because there's also a video due to the little time we had.

**[01:21:00] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> to issue you implemented this project.

**[01:21:03] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I just want to know maybe we are doing something because we have a city forest project that we are doing whereby within the city we create a forest within the city and with plant trees in the indigenous tree.

**[01:21:16] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I want to I'm trying to put like this something similar or just something that's looking like different aspects.

**[01:21:22] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> What's the uniqueness of these two things.

**[01:21:25] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:21:27] David Ross**
> Roberto, would you like to answer that about how we identify the lands to participate in the project?

**[01:21:34] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure.

**[01:21:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thanks for your question.

**[01:21:36] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, we are locals.

**[01:21:38] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know the landscape and we're part of the local society.

**[01:21:42] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So we know who are the real forest owners, the type of ecosystem, the diversity there.

**[01:21:50] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it's a matter of having a matter of being part of this project for almost four years.

**[01:21:56] robertopedrazaruiz**
> When since it was began then the people is approaching.

**[01:22:00] robertopedrazaruiz**
> ourselves to get these kind of payments because the characteristics of it, they're making far more money than the traditional activities.

**[01:22:07] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So you are fact in poverty, you are fact in climate change, and you are delaying the sixth wave of extinction.

**[01:22:13] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So why not go into it?

**[01:22:16] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So they have to prove the ownership of the land title, and in many cases they don't have one, because it's expensive to have one of those.

**[01:22:25] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So just with an equation of the local authority and the county, and because we know the folks and the neighbors, that's enough to get inside the project.

**[01:22:35] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So easy rules with the local protocol.

**[01:22:39] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> Thank you.

**[01:22:40] Folorunsho Dayo Oluwafemi**
> I believe I think you have an email address is already there, so under the presentation as well.

**[01:22:47] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Thank you so much.

**[01:22:48] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Sure, I will share it.

**[01:22:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I hope as these connections develop, people begin exploring these in other regions, let us know.

**[01:22:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is what we're here for.

**[01:23:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments on Sierra Gorda, I assure you, the Panama team will be following up because what you've done in in Mexico really seems like a great model for us.

**[01:23:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think it would be.

**[01:23:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very helpful to stand on your shoulders as we try to develop something in Panama.

**[01:23:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael.

**[01:23:23] Michael Mayer**
> I'm wondering whether ownership is a baseline requirement or whether, for instance, government.

**[01:23:37] Michael Mayer**
> Having some influence over vast private property holders is there a way Even if title is not held by those who are necessarily benefiting, I'm just, there's such vast potential here just wondering.

**[01:24:00] Michael Mayer**
> How can this be done in maybe non-traditional ways?

**[01:24:05] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Well, the state government was smart enough to understand this situation and just with this kind of local paper you can ensure that you are the owner.

**[01:24:15] robertopedrazaruiz**
> That doesn't happen in the big international protocols.

**[01:24:19] robertopedrazaruiz**
> Or even when the federal government had the money for the payment for environmental services, knew an actual land title, many land owners were left outside.

**[01:24:28] robertopedrazaruiz**
> But it has been a really unique situation in Sierra Gordon in my state, because we have a nice state government, we have the local capacities, and we're like the bridge between the local forest owners and these new attacks and the rules of the state government.

**[01:24:44] robertopedrazaruiz**
> So it has been a tailor made soot for this situation, but it's not happening in any other state in Mexico.

**[01:24:56] Michael Mayer**
> You would be good to follow up to see how that might be applied.

**[01:25:00] Michael Mayer**
> and in other areas, particularly in Africa.

**[01:25:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, it's interesting to note that in Sierra Gorda, the land ownership is a requirement of land ownership is a feature that ensures that the right people actually get the compensation.

**[01:25:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In other contexts, that might actually be a missed opportunity.

**[01:25:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll see what we can do.

**[01:25:26] Thilo**
> Yeah, thank you, John.

**[01:25:28] Thilo**
> This is Tilo, also from open forests involved in the Sierra Gorda project.

**[01:25:34] Thilo**
> I wanted to add or to mention is that since it's such a unique situation that we have here in Kereitawa, where the state has passed the law, where you need to track your carbon emissions and forces with the companies to pay taxes and to invest into environmental projects.

**[01:25:56] Thilo**
> And we have Sierra Gorda as a project that

**[01:26:00] Thilo**
> this, you know, has implemented in the course of the last 35 years, all these measures, and they're now being tracked digitally and monitored.

**[01:26:09] Thilo**
> And all of this is, you know, in the process of being integrated digitally.

**[01:26:15] Thilo**
> This, what we want to do, or what we are in the course of doing together with this group, or also in the government, is to create like a blueprint of this ecosystem.

**[01:26:27] Thilo**
> We call it the carbon, carbon ecosystem, right, that has been developed here, or it's in the process of being developed here in Sierra Guada.

**[01:26:35] Thilo**
> And we are advancing the technical integration about, from, you know, different systems that are involved in the system.

**[01:26:46] Thilo**
> And our plan is to bring it to the climate week in New York, to the climate nest.

**[01:26:52] Thilo**
> And we will offer workshops there, because we already have interest from different governments and organizations.

**[01:27:00] Thilo**
> patients who are seeking to use the model as a reference to implement in other locations and our plan is to bring it to climate week and we invite you to get in touch.

**[01:27:11] Thilo**
> We're happy to share the basis of this and also invite you to get in touch in order to arrange for a workshop meeting to discuss in more detail what the situation is and how this can potentially be adopted to wherever you might be and whatever the three requisites might be at that place.

**[01:27:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's great.

**[01:27:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It also raises the question of how will the ERA participate in climate week.

**[01:27:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's around time for us to really begin focusing on that because it's in September.

**[01:27:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Lynn.

**[01:27:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:28:02] sustainavistas**
> But I obviously I'd like to say if you're going to be doing stuff in climate week and also for Alex's band, next year from, actually this year from October 24 to October 25, Amsterdam is celebrating the 750 year anniversary.

**[01:28:18] sustainavistas**
> So we definitely should be get the carbon band and some of these projects.

**[01:28:22] sustainavistas**
> there's a group, a very famous group called the Bilderberg Convention, which is all the high level politicians and business people.

**[01:28:34] sustainavistas**
> we'd love to sort of get some of them on a practitioner and some of their money in their texts, euros and dollars to come down to the community level.

**[01:28:43] sustainavistas**
> But I'll give you one example, I'll post it in the chat now.

**[01:28:46] sustainavistas**
> Amsterdam is going to close the circuit of Freeway for a day or two and then we're going have the biggest street party, block party.

**[01:28:51] sustainavistas**
> And I think it's the 23rd of June 2025.

**[01:28:58] sustainavistas**

**[01:29:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> His email is in the chat.

**[01:29:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm serious.

**[01:29:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Someone needs to start pulling this together.

**[01:29:32] sustainavistas**
> Bye everyone.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cheers guys.

**[01:29:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have a good one.

**[01:29:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob has asked for as much time as he can possibly have to prepare his presentation.

**[01:29:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I see his lips are moving as if he's he's he's preparing.

**[01:29:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to say let's take a few minutes and just introduce ourselves if we haven't already.

**[01:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My top row, everyone has been introduced.

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Look at that.

**[01:30:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ananda, would you like to say hello?

**[01:30:09] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Hi, everyone.

**[01:30:11] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> We did an old spiel here or just hi, everyone.

**[01:30:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Just hello and who you are so that people want to get in touch with the chair of the steering committee or our new vice president or Ananda, the author of several books on water, they know how to associate your face with your name.

**[01:30:32] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> How's that?

**[01:30:33] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> All right.

**[01:30:34] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Thank you for doing all that for me, John.

**[01:30:39] Ananda Fitzsimmons**
> Philip.

**[01:30:50] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I heard my name.

**[01:30:52] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I have a back and president of the board of biographical climate and former in crime and other creative projects with

**[01:31:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> John on many many other things.

**[01:31:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There we go.

**[01:31:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And a member of our board as is Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:11] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> Yeah, I'm Fred Jennings.

**[01:31:13] Frederic Jennings, www.bio4climate.org**
> I'm I'm an ecological economist who works with biophor climate and I am, as John said, a member of the ERA Board and could might be to be involved with this organization.

**[01:31:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Russ Spear, who brought us, Alex Carlin and our musical interlude, say hello.

**[01:31:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Or not.

**[01:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Marius.

**[01:31:47] Russ Speer**
> Hello.

**[01:31:49] Russ Speer**
> Hi, sorry.

**[01:31:50] Russ Speer**
> I was pushing a bunch of buttons there.

**[01:31:52] Russ Speer**
> I just I just passed the invitation to come to Amsterdam on to Alex and his band.

**[01:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So wonderful.

**[01:32:01] Russ Speer**
> I mean, this is so amazing.

**[01:32:03] Russ Speer**
> All the different reports on the different projects.

**[01:32:07] Russ Speer**
> I think we got climate change, excuse me, not climate change, global warming on the run.

**[01:32:15] Russ Speer**
> There are actually several companies full, all of whom make great returns on the investment, and all of them who bring down huge amounts of carbon and mostly turn it into repurpose it into living carbon.

**[01:32:33] Russ Speer**
> Which, of course, we get enough living carbon off, things start cooling off, gets reasonable again.

**[01:32:41] Russ Speer**
> So lots of reasons for optimism.

**[01:32:44] Russ Speer**
> I should probably give a presentation in about a month or two.

**[01:32:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I look forward to that, Russ.

**[01:32:50] Russ Speer**
> Thank you.

**[01:32:51] Russ Speer**
> So find the next victim.

**[01:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:32:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Arias, that would be you from Uganda.

**[01:32:57] Russ Speer**
> Are you with us?

**[01:33:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then it will be sending and then it will be with you see him.

**[01:33:06] Ir Marius**
> Hello, Marius.

**[01:33:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:33:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:08:03] Rob De Laet**
> Hello everybody.

**[00:08:05] Rob De Laet**
> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.

**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.

**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.

**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning.

**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning, everybody.

**[00:09:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Pierre, associated with Alex by this is my memory test, my mental status exam.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.

**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been following you on social media.

**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.

**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.

**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ali bin Shahid.

**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think is also on the Bezos grant.

**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.

**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.

**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.

**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.

**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.

**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.

**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.

**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.

**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**
> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.

**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.

**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**
> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.

**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**
> And then went on to do biology.

**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**
> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.

**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**
> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.

**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**
> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.

**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.

**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**
> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.

**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.

**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**
> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.

**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.

**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**
> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.

**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**
> So living material is an agential material.

**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**
> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.

**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**
> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.

**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**
> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.

**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**
> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.

**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**
> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.

**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**
> And specifically, want to emphasize

**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**
> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.

**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**
> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.

**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**
> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.

**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**
> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.

**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**
> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.

**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**
> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.

**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**
> And I will talk about that.

**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**
> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.

**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**
> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.

**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**
> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.

**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**
> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.

**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**
> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.

**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**
> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.

**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**
> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.

**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**
> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.

**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**
> I also think that this can.

**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**
> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.

**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**
> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.

**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**
> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.

**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**
> It actually gets much weirder than that.

**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**
> So let's begin.

**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.

**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**
> So there are a couple of things going on here.

**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**
> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.

**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**
> we know where

**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**
> all the animals are here.

**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**
> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.

**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**
> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.

**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**
> We know where all the minds are here.

**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**
> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.

**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**
> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.

**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**
> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?

**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't God do it?

**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?

**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**
> Why did Adam have to name the animals?

**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**
> I think there are two interesting things here.

**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**
> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.

**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**
> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.

**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**
> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.

**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**
> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have

**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**
> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.

**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**
> so that part we should stick with.

**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**
> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.

**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**
> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.

**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**
> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.

**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**
> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.

**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**
> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?

**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**
> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?

**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**
> How far back here would you like to extend it?

**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**
> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.

**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**
> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.

**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**
> How did you get from here to here.

**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**
> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.

**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**
> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.

**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**
> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.

**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**
> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.

**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**
> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.

**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**
> And you will have other kinds of beings.

**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**
> So we'll get to that.

**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**
> So I'm working on a framework.

**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**
> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.

**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**
> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.

**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**
> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.

**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**
> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.

**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**
> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.

**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**
> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.

**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**
> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.

**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**
> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?

**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**
> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.

**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**
> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.

**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**
> It has to be experimentally valuable.

**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**
> It has to move discovery forward.

**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**
> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.

**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.

**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**
> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...

**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**
> or pleasant or whatever.

**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**
> It actually has very practical consequences.

**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**
> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.

**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**
> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.

**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**
> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.

**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**
> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.

**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**
> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.

**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**
> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.

**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**
> and are trainable by experiences.

**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**
> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.

**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**
> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.

**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**
> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?

**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**
> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.

**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.

**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**
> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.

**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**
> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.

**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**
> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically

**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**
> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.

**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**
> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.

**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**
> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.

**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**
> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.

**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**
> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> scaling?

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?

**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**
> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.

**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**
> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?

**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**
> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.

**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**
> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked

**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**
> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems

**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**
> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.

**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**
> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**
> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.

**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**
> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.

**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**
> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.

**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**
> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.

**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**
> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.

**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**
> These kinds of systems navigate.

**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**
> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.

**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**
> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.

**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.

**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**
> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.

**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**
> and so on.

**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**
> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.

**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**
> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.

**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**
> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**
> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.

**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**
> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.

**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**
> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.

**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**
> Michael.

**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?

**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**
> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.

**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this works in real life.

**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**
> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**
> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.

**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**
> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.

**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**
> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.

**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**
> It really doesn't take much.

**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**
> And so going to,

**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**
> beyond the single cell level.

**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**
> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.

**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**
> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.

**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**
> This is a cross-section through an adult human.

**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**
> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.

**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**
> Where does this come from?

**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**
> How do these cells know to build all of this?

**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**
> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.

**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**
> We have this genome.

**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**
> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.

**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**
> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.

**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**
> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**
> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.

**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**
> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.

**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are the results of...

**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**
> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.

**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**
> So now we need to know a few things.

**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**
> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?

**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**
> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?

**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**
> How do they know when to stop?

**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**
> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?

**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**
> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?

**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**
> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?

**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**
> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.

**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**
> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.

**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**
> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?

**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**
> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.

**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**
> Now, the obvious biomedical.

**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**
> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.

**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**
> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.

**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**
> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.

**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**
> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.

**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**
> You're not going to try to micromanage this.

**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**
> This is a communications device.

**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**
> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.

**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**
> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.

**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**
> What is it capable of doing?

**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**
> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.

**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**
> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.

**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**
> let's get it back.

**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**
> And why is that?

**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**
> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.

**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**
> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.

**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**
> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.

**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**
> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.

**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**
> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.

**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**
> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.

**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**
> But all of this has not yet been exploited.

**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**
> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.

**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**
> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> some sense.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.

**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**
> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.

**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**
> So let's do a definition first.

**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**
> I like William James's definition of intelligence.

**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**
> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**
> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.

**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**
> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.

**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**
> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.

**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**
> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the

**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**
> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.

**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**
> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.

**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**
> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?

**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.

**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**
> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.

**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**
> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.

**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**
> What we have here is something different, which is that

**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**
> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.

**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**
> That's because the system can do something quite clever.

**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**
> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.

**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**
> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.

**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**
> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.

**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**
> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.

**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**
> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.

**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**
> And this is how these twins are naturally born.

**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**
> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.

**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**
> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.

**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**
> And if you amputate anywhere along this.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> this limb.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.

**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**
> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?

**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**
> So at any position, you can do this.

**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**
> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.

**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**
> That's the most amazing part of all of this.

**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**
> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> When does it stop?

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**
> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.

**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**
> You're here.

**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**
> It immediately recognizes the delta.

**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**
> It starts to reduce that error.

**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**
> So you've got an error minimization scheme.

**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**
> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.

**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**
> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.

**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**
> And this is how you recognize goals.

**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**
> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is

**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**
> its emergent complexity.

**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**
> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.

**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**
> That's not intelligence.

**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**
> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.

**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**
> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.

**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**
> And that's what happens here.

**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**
> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.

**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**
> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.

**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**
> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.

**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**
> Human livers are highly regenerative.

**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**
> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.

**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**
> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.

**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**
> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.

**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**
> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> things.

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.

**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**
> Here's where every cell goes.

**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**
> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.

**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**
> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?

**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**
> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?

**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**
> I'll show you both of those things.

**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**
> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?

**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**
> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.

**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**
> are they cooperating?

**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**
> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.

**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**
> So just imagine you've got this rat.

**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**
> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.

**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**
> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.

**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**
> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.

**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**
> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.

**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**
> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.

**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**
> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that

**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**
> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.

**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**
> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.

**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**
> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.

**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?

**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**
> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?

**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**
> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.

**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**
> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.

**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**
> It's the electrical network.

**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,

**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**
> is implemented by electrical networks.

**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**
> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**
> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.

**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**
> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.

**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**
> It's quite amazing.

**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**
> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.

**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**
> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.

**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**
> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.

**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**
> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.

**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**
> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.

**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**
> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> it turns

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.

**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**
> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.

**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**
> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.

**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**
> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.

**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**
> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.

**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**
> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.

**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**
> What were these networks thinking about?

**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**
> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?

**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.

**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**
> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.

**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**
> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.

**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**
> So this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**
> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.

**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**
> So this is not a simulation.

**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**
> This is real animal.

**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**
> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.

**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**
> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.

**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**
> I want to show you what they look like.

**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**
> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**
> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.

**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**
> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.

**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**
> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.

**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**
> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.

**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**
> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.

**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**
> This is where the mouth is going to go.

**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**
> There's some other placode structures that come out here.

**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**
> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.

**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**
> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.

**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**
> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.

**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**
> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop

**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**
> on it and to try to decode it.

**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**
> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.

**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**
> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.

**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**
> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.

**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**
> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.

**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**
> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.

**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**
> And we now have the tools.

**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**
> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.

**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**
> So now we can finally answer the question.

**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**
> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> How do they know?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.

**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**
> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.

**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**
> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?

**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**
> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.

**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**
> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.

**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**
> So from this, we learn three things.

**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**
> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.

**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**
> If you use those same

**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**
> signals elsewhere in the body.

**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**
> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.

**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**
> I could show you lots of other organs.

**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**
> Second, it's modular.

**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**
> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**
> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.

**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**
> We spoke to them at a very high level.

**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**
> We said, build an eye here.

**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**
> That is a very high level subroutine call.

**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**
> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.

**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**
> This is not micromanagement.

**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the genes.

**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the cells.

**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**
> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.

**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.

**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk later.

**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**
> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.

**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk about how you might do that.

**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**
> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...

**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**
> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.

**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**
> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?

**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**
> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.

**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**
> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.

**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**
> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.

**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**
> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of

**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**
> participants and so on.

**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**
> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about

**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**
> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.

**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**
> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.

**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**
> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.

**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**
> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us

**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**
> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.

**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**
> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.

**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**
> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.

**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**
> They are immortal.

**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**
> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.

**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**
> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.

**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**
> They've been around for 400 million years.

**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**
> These are them.

**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**
> They do not age and die.

**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**
> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.

**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**
> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.

**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**
> It's supposed to be the other way around.

**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**
> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.

**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**
> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.

**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**
> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.

**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**
> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?

**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**
> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.

**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**
> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.

**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**
> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?

**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**
> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.

**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**
> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.

**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**
> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.

**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**
> You can say, no, you should have two heads.

**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**
> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.

**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.

**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**
> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.

**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**
> This is not AI or Photoshop.

**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**
> These are real animals.

**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**
> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.

**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**
> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.

**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**
> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.

**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**
> Yep

**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.

**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> can do that.

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**
> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.

**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.

**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.

**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**
> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.

**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**
> This is this is their only now.

**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.

**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**
> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yep.

**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**
> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.

**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**
> Why?

**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**
> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could

**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**
> continuously cut them in plain water.

**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**
> No more manipulation of any kind.

**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**
> They remain two-headed.

**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**
> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.

**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**
> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.

**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**
> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.

**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**
> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.

**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**
> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?

**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**
> And the genomes are exactly identical.

**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing wrong with them.

**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**
> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?

**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**
> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.

**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**
> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.

**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**

**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**
> So these are derocephalus.

**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**
> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.

**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**
> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.

**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**
> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.

**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**
> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.

**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**
> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?

**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**
> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.

**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**
> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.

**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**
> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.

**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**
> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.

**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**
> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.

**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**
> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.

**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**
> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.

**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**
> We would have never known that.

**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**
> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.

**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**
> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.

**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**
> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.

**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**
> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.

**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**
> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?

**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**
> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.

**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**
> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.

**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**
> So lots of evolution going on.

**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**
> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.

**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**
> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.

**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**
> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.

**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**
> They're put in a little depression.

**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**
> They could have done many things.

**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**
> They could have died.

**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**
> They could have spread away from each other.

**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**
> They could have formed a flat monolayer.

**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**
> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.

**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**
> We call it a xenobot.

**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**
> Xenobot because Xenopus later.

**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**
> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.

**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**
> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.

**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**
> So they're coordinated to swim.

**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**
> They can go in circles like this.

**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**
> They can go back and forth like this.

**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**
> And remember, this is just skin.

**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**
> There's no, these are epithelial cells.

**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**
> There is no neurons here.

**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing else.

**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**
> They have collective behaviors.

**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**
> They can interact with each other.

**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**
> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.

**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**
> They can have individual behaviors and so on.

**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**
> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.

**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**
> So it floats down here.

**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**
> It's swimming along.

**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**
> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.

**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**
> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.

**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**
> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff

**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**
> here are just the dissociated skin cells.

**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**
> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.

**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**
> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.

**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**
> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?

**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**
> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.

**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**
> This is called kinematic replication.

**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**
> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.

**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**
> This is completely novel.

**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**
> We did not teach them to do this.

**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**
> We did not have to force them to do this.

**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**
> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**
> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.

**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**
> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.

**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?

**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**
> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.

**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**
> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.

**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**
> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.

**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**
> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.

**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**
> They do have a developmental sequence.

**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**
> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.

**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**
> I have no idea.

**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**
> And they have these behaviors.

**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**
> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.

**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any xenobots.

**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.

**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any kinematic replication.

**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**
> All of this emerges spontaneously.

**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**
> It's not just complexity.

> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.

**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.

**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**
> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.

**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**
> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings

**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**
> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.

**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**
> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.

**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**
> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.

**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**
> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.

**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**
> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for

**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**
> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.

**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**
> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.

**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**
> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.

**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are possible.

**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**
> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.

**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**
> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.

**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**
> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.

**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**
> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.

**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**

**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**
> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.

**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**
> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.

**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**
> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.

**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**
> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.

**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**
> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.

**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**
> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.

**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**
> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.

**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**
> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.

**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**
> I was looking for...

**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**
> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.

**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**
> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.

**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**
> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.

**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**
> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.

**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**
> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.

**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**
> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.

**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...

**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**
> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.

**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**
> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.

**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**
> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.

**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**
> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.

**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**
> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.

**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**
> imagine something.

**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**
> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.

**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**
> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.

**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**
> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.

**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**
> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.

**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**
> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.

**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**
> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.

**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**
> It's like a plasmode.

**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**
> very rarefied plasma.

**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**
> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.

**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**
> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.

**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**
> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.

**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**
> And we don't even see it.

**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of information.

**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**
> They're not real, like us.

**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**
> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.

**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**
> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.

**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**
> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.

**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**
> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.

**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**
> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.

**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**
> And the others say, well, that's crazy.

**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**
> We're real organisms.

**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**
> We're solid.

**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**
> Patterns in gas can't be agents.

**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**
> What do you mean patterns?

**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**
> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?

**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**
> says, well, about 100 years.

**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**
> But that's crazy.

**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**
> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.

**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**
> That's too short.

**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**
> so what I think

**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**
> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.

**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**
> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.

**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**
> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.

**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**
> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.

**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**
> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.

**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**
> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.

**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**
> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.

**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**
> these systems.

**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**
> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.

**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**
> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?

**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**
> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.

**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**
> So here's where I'll end.

**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**
> What I tried to tell you today is this.

**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**
> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.

**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**
> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.

**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**
> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.

**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**
> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.

**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**
> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.

**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**
> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.

**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**
> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.

**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**
> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.

**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.

**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**
> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.

**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**
> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.

**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**
> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.

**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**
> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.

**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**
> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.

**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**

**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**

**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**

**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**
> Alex.

**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.

**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**
> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.

**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**
> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.

**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**
> So that's what takes me into biology.

**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**
> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.

**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**
> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.

**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**
> I think that's exactly right.

**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**
> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.

**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**
> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.

**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**
> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.

**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**
> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?

**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**
> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?

**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**
> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.

**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**
> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.

**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**
> But they can access these things.

**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**
> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.

**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**
> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?

**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**
> So last question, are we machines ourselves?

**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**

**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**
> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.

**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**
> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.

**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**
> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.

**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**
> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.

**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**
> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.

**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**
> like this.

**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**
> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.

**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**
> Let's take that last example.

**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**
> So they donate their lung and their trachea.

**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**
> We buy those cells from a company.

**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**
> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.

**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**
> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.

**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**
> They look kind of like xenobots.

**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**
> They have some different behaviors.

**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**
> They have some amazing capabilities.

**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**
> They can heal neural wounds.

**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**
> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?

**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**
> So the original patient is perhaps dead.

**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**
> Their cells are not dead.

**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**
> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.

**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**
> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?

**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Where is this supposed to go?

**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**
> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,

**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**
> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.

**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**
> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.

**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**
> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.

**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**
> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.

**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**
> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.

**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**
> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.

**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**
> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.

**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**
> For example, we get tissue from smokers.

**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**
> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?

**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**
> You know, it's about a million questions.

**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**
> death is, yeah, I don't know.

**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**
> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.

**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> And if so,

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?

**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**
> How are they being generated?

**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, great question.

**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**
> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.

**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**
> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.

**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**
> OK, let's say they don't.

**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**
> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.

**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**
> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.

**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**
> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?

**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**
> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.

**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**
> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?

**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.

**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**
> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?

**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**
> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.

**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**
> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.

**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**
> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**
> They get to the bottom.

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> What do they do?

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> make a beautiful bell curve, right?

**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**
> They make a Gaussian distribution.

**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**
> So now you can ask a simple question.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Okay, that's a nice shape.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Where did that come from?

**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**
> So you're looking at the marbles.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the nails.

**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the wood.

**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**
> Also not there.

**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**
> Where did it come from, right?

**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**
> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.

**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**
> Where is that?

**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**
> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.

**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**
> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.

**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**
> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?

**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**
> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.

**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**
> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> And that's great.

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> Well, guess what?

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> You don't need to look for the third angle.

**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**
> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.

**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**
> So where is that?

**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**
> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?

**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**
> This is not some philosophical fluff.

**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**
> This is super practical.

**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**
> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.

**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**
> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.

**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**
> there are three things we need to track.

**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.

**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.

**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**

**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> doesn't have to be.

**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?

**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.

**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**
> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.

**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**
> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?

**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**
> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.

**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**
> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.

**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**
> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.

**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**

**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**

**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**

**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**

**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.

**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.

**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a

**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.

**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.

**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.

**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.

**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.

**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.

**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.

**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Like currently, basically the characteristics.

**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.

**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.

**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.

**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so

**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.

**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.

**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.

**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.

**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.

**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.

**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.

**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.

**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.

**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.

**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.

**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is

**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.

**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.

**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.

**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.

**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.

**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.

**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.

**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> It can be

**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.

**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.

**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.

**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.

**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.

**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> culture, but you're doing other things.

**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.

**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.

**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.

**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.

**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.

**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar

**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> the region.

**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.

**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.

**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.

**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.

**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.

**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> because the number of land to be exploited.

**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.

**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.

**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.

**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.

**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.

**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.

**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's it.

**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.

**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.

**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...

**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.

**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.

**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after you command to national forest.

**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> that's why my last slide.

**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.

**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Before, make sure our dream comes true.

**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.

**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.

**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.

**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.

**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.

**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.

**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.

**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.

**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.

**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?

**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.

**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.

**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?

**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The cover trees and which one should be planted?

**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yes, as we're also making

**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.

**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.

**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.

**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.

**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob.

**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**
> I thank you for great work.

**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**
> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.

**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**
> The 2nd 1.

**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**
> You can ask that straight away.

**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will create.

**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> will.

**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.

**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.

**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the short answer to your question.

**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**
> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.

**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**
> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.

**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**
> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.

**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**
> I am certainly not an expert.

**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.

**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.

**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that is something.

**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a timely question.

**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.

**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.

**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin.

**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yes.

**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**
> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.

**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**
> That's very inspiring.

**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**
> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.

**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.

**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.

**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**
> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.

**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**
> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.

**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**
> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.

**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**
> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.

**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?

**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**
> What would a long-term region be for that?

**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.

**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.

**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some

**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so we will proceed with this.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.

**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.

**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the work here?

**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the actual planting?

**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do they get paid and so on?

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How does the labor component figure into this?

**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're

**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.

**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.

**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.

**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?

**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Okay.

**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.

**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.

**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.

**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> in our planning, we have

**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.

**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.

**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.

**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.

**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.

**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.

**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.

**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.

**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.

**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.

**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.

**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.

**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.

**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.

**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.

**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.

**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.

**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**
> I just have a question.

**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.

**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**
> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?

**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**
> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.

**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,

**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.

**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.

**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.

**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.

**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.

**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.

**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that would be one of the story.

**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they

**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.

**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.

**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.

**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.

**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, this is our website You

**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.

**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.

**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is the test.

**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If I search for Colombo, there he is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is the information we have.

**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.

**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.

**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.

**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.

**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There will be basically a member space and a public space.

**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.

**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.

**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.

**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.

**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will also say that once we have a directory.

**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to start encouraging members to become.

**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.

**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.

**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.

**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.

**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.

**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.

**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's 10.56.

**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have no other items that I really want to get to.

**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you everybody.

**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for being here.

**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, John.

**[00:07:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you.

**[00:07:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, I'm delighted you're here.

**[00:07:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be I'm going to make a note to follow up so that I can invite you to tell your story to us because as you know, Michael may not this is both our town hall meeting ongoing seminar and.

**[00:07:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Initiation ritual where it's an opportunity for mutual discernment where for people who might like to be affiliated with the restoration Alliance introduced themselves and then when there are no objections as has been the case, they become full fledged members of the or a well the rights and responsibilities there to.

**[00:07:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:07:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob delay.

**[00:07:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who actually pronounces his name, Rob the left, but what does he know.

**[00:07:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is where you.

**[00:08:01] Rob De Laet**
> I'm in Amsterdam.

**[00:08:03] Rob De Laet**
> Hello everybody.

**[00:08:05] Rob De Laet**
> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.

**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.

**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.

**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, hello, Kwaki.

**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning.

**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning, everybody.

**[00:09:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Pierre, associated with Alex by this is my memory test, my mental status exam.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.

**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been following you on social media.

**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.

**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.

**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ali bin Shahid.

**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think is also on the Bezos grant.

**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.

**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.

**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.

**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.

**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.

**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.

**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.

**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.

**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**
> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.

**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.

**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**
> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.

**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**
> And then went on to do biology.

**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**
> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.

**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**
> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.

**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**
> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.

**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.

**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**
> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.

**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.

**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**
> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.

**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.

**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**
> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.

**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**
> So living material is an agential material.

**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**
> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.

**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**
> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.

**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**
> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.

**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**
> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.

**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**
> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.

**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**
> And specifically, want to emphasize

**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**
> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.

**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**
> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.

**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**
> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.

**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**
> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.

**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**
> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.

**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**
> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.

**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**
> And I will talk about that.

**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**
> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.

**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**
> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.

**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**
> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.

**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**
> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.

**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**
> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.

**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**
> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.

**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**
> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.

**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**
> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.

**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**
> I also think that this can.

**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**
> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.

**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**
> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.

**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**
> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.

**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**
> It actually gets much weirder than that.

**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**
> So let's begin.

**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.

**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**
> So there are a couple of things going on here.

**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**
> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.

**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**
> we know where

**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**
> all the animals are here.

**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**
> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.

**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**
> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.

**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**
> We know where all the minds are here.

**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**
> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.

**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**
> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.

**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**
> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?

**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't God do it?

**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?

**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**
> Why did Adam have to name the animals?

**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**
> I think there are two interesting things here.

**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**
> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.

**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**
> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.

**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**
> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.

**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**
> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have

**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**
> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.

**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**
> so that part we should stick with.

**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**
> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.

**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**
> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.

**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**
> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.

**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**
> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.

**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**
> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?

**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**
> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?

**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**
> How far back here would you like to extend it?

**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**
> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.

**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**
> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.

**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**
> How did you get from here to here.

**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**
> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.

**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**
> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.

**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**
> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.

**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**
> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.

**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**
> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.

**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**
> And you will have other kinds of beings.

**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**
> So we'll get to that.

**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**
> So I'm working on a framework.

**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**
> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.

**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**
> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.

**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**
> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.

**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**
> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.

**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**
> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.

**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**
> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.

**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**
> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.

**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**
> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?

**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**
> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.

**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**
> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.

**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**
> It has to be experimentally valuable.

**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**
> It has to move discovery forward.

**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**
> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.

**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.

**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**
> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...

**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**
> or pleasant or whatever.

**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**
> It actually has very practical consequences.

**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**
> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.

**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**
> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.

**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**
> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.

**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**
> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.

**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**
> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.

**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**
> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.

**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**
> and are trainable by experiences.

**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**
> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.

**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**
> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.

**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**
> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?

**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**
> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.

**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.

**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**
> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.

**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**
> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.

**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**
> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically

**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**
> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.

**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**
> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.

**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**
> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.

**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**
> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.

**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**
> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> scaling?

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?

**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**
> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.

**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**
> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?

**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**
> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.

**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**
> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked

**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**
> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems

**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**
> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.

**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**
> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**
> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.

**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**
> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.

**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**
> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.

**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**
> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.

**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**
> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.

**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**
> These kinds of systems navigate.

**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**
> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.

**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**
> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.

**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.

**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**
> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.

**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**
> and so on.

**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**
> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.

**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**
> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.

**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**
> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**
> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.

**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**
> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.

**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**
> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.

**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**
> Michael.

**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?

**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**
> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.

**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this works in real life.

**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**
> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**
> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.

**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**
> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.

**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**
> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.

**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**
> It really doesn't take much.

**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**
> And so going to,

**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**
> beyond the single cell level.

**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**
> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.

**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**
> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.

**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**
> This is a cross-section through an adult human.

**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**
> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.

**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**
> Where does this come from?

**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**
> How do these cells know to build all of this?

**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**
> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.

**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**
> We have this genome.

**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**
> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.

**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**
> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.

**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**
> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**
> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.

**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**
> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.

**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are the results of...

**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**
> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.

**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**
> So now we need to know a few things.

**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**
> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?

**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**
> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?

**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**
> How do they know when to stop?

**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**
> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?

**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**
> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?

**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**
> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?

**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**
> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.

**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**
> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.

**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**
> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?

**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**
> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.

**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**
> Now, the obvious biomedical.

**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**
> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.

**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**
> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.

**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**
> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.

**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**
> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.

**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**
> You're not going to try to micromanage this.

**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**
> This is a communications device.

**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**
> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.

**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**
> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.

**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**
> What is it capable of doing?

**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**
> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.

**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**
> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.

**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**
> let's get it back.

**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**
> And why is that?

**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**
> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.

**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**
> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.

**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**
> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.

**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**
> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.

**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**
> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.

**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**
> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.

**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**
> But all of this has not yet been exploited.

**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**
> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.

**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**
> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> some sense.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.

**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**
> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.

**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**
> So let's do a definition first.

**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**
> I like William James's definition of intelligence.

**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**
> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**
> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.

**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**
> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.

**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**
> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.

**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**
> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the

**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**
> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.

**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**
> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.

**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**
> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?

**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.

**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**
> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.

**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**
> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.

**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**
> What we have here is something different, which is that

**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**
> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.

**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**
> That's because the system can do something quite clever.

**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**
> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.

**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**
> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.

**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**
> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.

**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**
> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.

**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**
> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.

**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**
> And this is how these twins are naturally born.

**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**
> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.

**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**
> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.

**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**
> And if you amputate anywhere along this.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> this limb.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.

**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**
> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?

**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**
> So at any position, you can do this.

**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**
> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.

**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**
> That's the most amazing part of all of this.

**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**
> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> When does it stop?

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**
> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.

**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**
> You're here.

**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**
> It immediately recognizes the delta.

**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**
> It starts to reduce that error.

**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**
> So you've got an error minimization scheme.

**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**
> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.

**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**
> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.

**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**
> And this is how you recognize goals.

**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**
> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is

**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**
> its emergent complexity.

**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**
> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.

**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**
> That's not intelligence.

**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**
> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.

**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**
> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.

**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**
> And that's what happens here.

**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**
> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.

**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**
> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.

**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**
> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.

**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**
> Human livers are highly regenerative.

**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**
> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.

**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**
> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.

**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**
> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.

**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**
> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> things.

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.

**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**
> Here's where every cell goes.

**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**
> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.

**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**
> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?

**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**
> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?

**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**
> I'll show you both of those things.

**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**
> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?

**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**
> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.

**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**
> are they cooperating?

**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**
> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.

**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**
> So just imagine you've got this rat.

**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**
> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.

**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**
> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.

**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**
> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.

**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**
> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.

**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**
> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.

**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**
> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that

**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**
> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.

**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**
> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.

**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**
> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.

**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?

**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**
> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?

**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**
> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.

**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**
> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.

**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**
> It's the electrical network.

**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,

**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**
> is implemented by electrical networks.

**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**
> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**
> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.

**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**
> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.

**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**
> It's quite amazing.

**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**
> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.

**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**
> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.

**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**
> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.

**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**
> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.

**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**
> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.

**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**
> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> it turns

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.

**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**
> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.

**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**
> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.

**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**
> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.

**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**
> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.

**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**
> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.

**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**
> What were these networks thinking about?

**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**
> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?

**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.

**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**
> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.

**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**
> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.

**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**
> So this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**
> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.

**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**
> So this is not a simulation.

**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**
> This is real animal.

**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**
> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.

**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**
> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.

**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**
> I want to show you what they look like.

**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**
> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**
> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.

**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**
> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.

**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**
> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.

**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**
> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.

**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**
> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.

**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**
> This is where the mouth is going to go.

**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**
> There's some other placode structures that come out here.

**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**
> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.

**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**
> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.

**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**
> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.

**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**
> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop

**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**
> on it and to try to decode it.

**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**
> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.

**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**
> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.

**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**
> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.

**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**
> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.

**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**
> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.

**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**
> And we now have the tools.

**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**
> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.

**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**
> So now we can finally answer the question.

**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**
> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> How do they know?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.

**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**
> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.

**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**
> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?

**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**
> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.

**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**
> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.

**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**
> So from this, we learn three things.

**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**
> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.

**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**
> If you use those same

**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**
> signals elsewhere in the body.

**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**
> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.

**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**
> I could show you lots of other organs.

**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**
> Second, it's modular.

**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**
> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**
> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.

**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**
> We spoke to them at a very high level.

**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**
> We said, build an eye here.

**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**
> That is a very high level subroutine call.

**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**
> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.

**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**
> This is not micromanagement.

**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the genes.

**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the cells.

**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**
> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.

**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.

**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk later.

**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**
> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.

**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk about how you might do that.

**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**
> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...

**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**
> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.

**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**
> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?

**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**
> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.

**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**
> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.

**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**
> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.

**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**
> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of

**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**
> participants and so on.

**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**
> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about

**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**
> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.

**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**
> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.

**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**
> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.

**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**
> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us

**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**
> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.

**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**
> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.

**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**
> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.

**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**
> They are immortal.

**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**
> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.

**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**
> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.

**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**
> They've been around for 400 million years.

**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**
> These are them.

**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**
> They do not age and die.

**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**
> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.

**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**
> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.

**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**
> It's supposed to be the other way around.

**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**
> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.

**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**
> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.

**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**
> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.

**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**
> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?

**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**
> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.

**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**
> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.

**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**
> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?

**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**
> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.

**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**
> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.

**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**
> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.

**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**
> You can say, no, you should have two heads.

**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**
> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.

**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.

**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**
> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.

**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**
> This is not AI or Photoshop.

**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**
> These are real animals.

**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**
> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.

**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**
> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.

**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**
> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.

**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**
> Yep

**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.

**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> can do that.

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**
> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.

**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.

**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.

**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**
> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.

**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**
> This is this is their only now.

**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.

**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**
> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yep.

**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**
> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.

**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**
> Why?

**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**
> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could

**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**
> continuously cut them in plain water.

**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**
> No more manipulation of any kind.

**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**
> They remain two-headed.

**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**
> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.

**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**
> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.

**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**
> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.

**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**
> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.

**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**
> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?

**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**
> And the genomes are exactly identical.

**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing wrong with them.

**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**
> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?

**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**
> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.

**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**
> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.

**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**
> Not only can you, not only can you

**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**
> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.

**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**
> So these are derocephalus.

**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**
> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.

**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**
> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.

**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**
> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.

**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**
> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.

**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**
> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?

**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**
> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.

**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**
> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.

**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**
> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.

**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**
> You don't have to even be

**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**
> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.

**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**
> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.

**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**
> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.

**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**
> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.

**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**
> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.

**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**
> We would have never known that.

**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**
> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.

**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**
> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.

**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**
> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.

**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**
> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.

**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**
> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?

**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**
> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.

**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**
> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.

**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**
> So lots of evolution going on.

**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**
> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.

**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**
> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.

**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**
> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.

**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**
> They're put in a little depression.

**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**
> They could have done many things.

**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**
> They could have died.

**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**
> They could have spread away from each other.

**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**
> They could have formed a flat monolayer.

**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**
> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.

**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**
> We call it a xenobot.

**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**
> Xenobot because Xenopus later.

**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**
> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.

**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**
> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.

**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**
> So they're coordinated to swim.

**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**
> They can go in circles like this.

**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**
> They can go back and forth like this.

**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**
> And remember, this is just skin.

**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**
> There's no, these are epithelial cells.

**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**
> There is no neurons here.

**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing else.

**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**
> They have collective behaviors.

**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**
> They can interact with each other.

**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**
> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.

**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**
> They can have individual behaviors and so on.

**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**
> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.

**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**
> So it floats down here.

**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**
> It's swimming along.

**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**
> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.

**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**
> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**

**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**
> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.

**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**
> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.

**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**
> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?

**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**
> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.

**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**
> This is called kinematic replication.

**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**
> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.

**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**
> This is completely novel.

**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**
> We did not teach them to do this.

**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**
> We did not have to force them to do this.

**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**
> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**
> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.

**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**
> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.

**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?

**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**
> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.

**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**
> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.

**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**
> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.

**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**
> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.

**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**
> They do have a developmental sequence.

**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**
> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.

**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**
> I have no idea.

**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**
> And they have these behaviors.

**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**
> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.

**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any xenobots.

**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.

**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any kinematic replication.

**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**
> All of this emerges spontaneously.

**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**
> It's not just complexity.

> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.

**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.

**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**
> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.

**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**
> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings

**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**
> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.

**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**
> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.

**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**
> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.

**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**
> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.

**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**
> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for

**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**
> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.

**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**
> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.

**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**
> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.

**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are possible.

**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**
> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.

**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**
> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.

**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**
> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.

**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**
> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.

**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**
> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.

**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**
> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.

**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**
> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.

**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**
> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.

**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**
> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.

**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**
> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.

**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**
> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.

**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**
> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.

**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**
> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.

**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**
> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.

**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**
> I was looking for...

**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**
> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.

**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**
> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.

**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**
> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.

**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**
> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.

**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**
> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.

**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**
> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.

**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...

**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**
> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.

**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**
> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.

**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**
> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.

**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**
> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.

**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**
> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.

**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**
> imagine something.

**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**
> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.

**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**
> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.

**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**
> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.

**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**
> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.

**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**
> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.

**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**
> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.

**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**
> It's like a plasmode.

**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**
> very rarefied plasma.

**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**
> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.

**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**
> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.

**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**
> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.

**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**
> And we don't even see it.

**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of information.

**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**
> They're not real, like us.

**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**
> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.

**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**
> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.

**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**
> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.

**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**
> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.

**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**
> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.

**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**
> And the others say, well, that's crazy.

**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**
> We're real organisms.

**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**
> We're solid.

**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**
> Patterns in gas can't be agents.

**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**
> What do you mean patterns?

**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**
> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?

**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**
> says, well, about 100 years.

**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**
> But that's crazy.

**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**
> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.

**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**
> That's too short.

**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**
> so what I think

**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**
> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.

**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**
> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.

**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**
> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.

**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**
> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.

**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**
> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.

**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**
> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.

**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**
> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.

**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**
> these systems.

**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**
> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.

**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**
> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?

**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**
> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.

**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**
> So here's where I'll end.

**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**
> What I tried to tell you today is this.

**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**
> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.

**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**
> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.

**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**
> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.

**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**
> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.

**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**
> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.

**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**
> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.

**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**
> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.

**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**
> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.

**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.

**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**
> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.

**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**
> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.

**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**
> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.

**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**
> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.

**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**
> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.

**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**
> These are two companies that support this work.

**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**
> So I thank you.

**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Wow.

**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could- Thank you.

**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?

**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**
> I have a few minutes.

**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.

**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Really nice.

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to let other people go first.

**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm loaded with questions.

**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**
> Alex.

**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.

**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**
> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.

**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**
> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.

**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**
> So that's what takes me into biology.

**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**
> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.

**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**
> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.

**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**
> I think that's exactly right.

**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**
> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.

**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**
> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.

**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**
> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.

**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**
> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?

**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**
> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?

**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**
> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.

**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**
> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.

**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**
> But they can access these things.

**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**
> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.

**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**
> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?

**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**
> So last question, are we machines ourselves?

**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**
> Are we technologies of the natural world?

**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**
> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.

**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**
> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.

**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**
> This is not what machines are.

**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**
> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?

**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**
> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.

**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**
> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.

**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**
> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and

**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**

**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Good question.

**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**
> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.

**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**
> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.

**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**
> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.

**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**
> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.

**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**
> like this.

**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**
> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.

**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**
> Let's take that last example.

**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**
> So they donate their lung and their trachea.

**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**
> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.

**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**
> So the original patient is perhaps dead.

**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**
> Their cells are not dead.

**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**
> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.

**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Where is this supposed to go?

**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**
> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,

**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**
> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.

**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**
> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.

**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**
> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.

**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**
> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.

**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**
> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.

**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**
> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.

**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**
> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.

**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**
> For example, we get tissue from smokers.

**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**
> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?

**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**

**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**
> death is, yeah, I don't know.

**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**

**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks.

**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.

**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**
> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.

**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> And if so,

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?

**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**
> How are they being generated?

**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, great question.

**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**
> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.

**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**
> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.

**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**
> OK, let's say they don't.

**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**
> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.

**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**
> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.

**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**
> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?

**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**
> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.

**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**
> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?

**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.

**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**
> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?

**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**
> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.

**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**
> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.

**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**
> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**
> They get to the bottom.

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> What do they do?

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> make a beautiful bell curve, right?

**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**
> They make a Gaussian distribution.

**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**
> So now you can ask a simple question.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Okay, that's a nice shape.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Where did that come from?

**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**
> So you're looking at the marbles.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the nails.

**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the wood.

**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**
> Also not there.

**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**
> Where did it come from, right?

**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**
> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.

**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**
> Where is that?

**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**
> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.

**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**
> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.

**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**
> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?

**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**
> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.

**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**
> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> And that's great.

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> Well, guess what?

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> You don't need to look for the third angle.

**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**
> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.

**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**
> So where is that?

**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**
> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?

**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**
> This is not some philosophical fluff.

**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**
> This is super practical.

**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**
> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.

**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**
> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.

**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**
> there are three things we need to track.

**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.

**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.

**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**
> I'm not sure.

**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**
> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.

**[01:24:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They come from wherever the laws of mathematics come from.

**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My turn.

**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.

**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.

**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.

**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.

**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.

**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.

**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> doesn't have to be.

**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?

**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.

**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**
> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.

**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**
> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?

**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**
> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.

**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**
> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.

**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**
> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.

**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**
> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.

**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**
> So, you know,

**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**
> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.

**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**
> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.

**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**
> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.

**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**
> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?

**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**
> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?

**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**
> Does it do anticipation?

**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**
> Does it do generalization?

**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**
> Does it do associative learning?

**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**
> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.

**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**
> We could start with models.

**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**
> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.

**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**
> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.

**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**
> And I think you can learn a lot from that.

**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.

**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.

**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.

**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**
> Sure, cool.

**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, thank you so much.

**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**
> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.

**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**
> you.

**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**
> All right, bye bye.

**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Deep breath.

**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for hanging in.

**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.

**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.

**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.

**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.

**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The steering committee looked at his proposal.

**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.

**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's really making progress.

**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.

**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.

**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He needs a mere another $4,500.

**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can we help him go over the edge?

**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.

**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.

**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.

**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.

**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The floor is yours.

**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.

**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.

**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah.

**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Thank you, John, and everyone.

**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I think my network is okay.

**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.

**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I know we are all exhausted.

**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to

**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.

**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.

**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.

**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a

**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.

**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.

**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.

**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.

**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.

**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.

**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.

**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Like currently, basically the characteristics.

**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.

**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.

**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.

**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so

**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.

**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.

**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.

**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.

**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.

**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.

**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.

**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.

**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.

**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.

**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.

**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is

**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.

**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.

**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.

**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.

**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.

**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.

**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.

**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> It can be

**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.

**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.

**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.

**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.

**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.

**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> culture, but you're doing other things.

**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.

**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.

**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.

**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.

**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.

**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar

**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> the region.

**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.

**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.

**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.

**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.

**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.

**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> because the number of land to be exploited.

**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.

**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.

**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.

**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.

**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.

**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.

**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's it.

**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.

**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.

**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...

**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.

**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.

**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after you command to national forest.

**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> that's why my last slide.

**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.

**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Before, make sure our dream comes true.

**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.

**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.

**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.

**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.

**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.

**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.

**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.

**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.

**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.

**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?

**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.

**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.

**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?

**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The cover trees and which one should be planted?

**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yes, as we're also making

**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.

**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.

**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.

**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.

**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob.

**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**
> I thank you for great work.

**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**
> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.

**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**
> The 2nd 1.

**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**
> You can ask that straight away.

**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will create.

**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> will.

**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.

**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.

**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the short answer to your question.

**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**
> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.

**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**
> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.

**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**
> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.

**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**
> I am certainly not an expert.

**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.

**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.

**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that is something.

**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a timely question.

**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.

**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.

**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin.

**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yes.

**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**
> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.

**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**
> That's very inspiring.

**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**
> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.

**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.

**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.

**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**
> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.

**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**
> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.

**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**
> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.

**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**
> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.

**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?

**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**
> What would a long-term region be for that?

**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.

**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.

**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some

**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so we will proceed with this.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.

**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.

**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the work here?

**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the actual planting?

**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do they get paid and so on?

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How does the labor component figure into this?

**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're

**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.

**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.

**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.

**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?

**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Okay.

**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.

**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.

**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.

**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> in our planning, we have

**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.

**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.

**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.

**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.

**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.

**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.

**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.

**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.

**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.

**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.

**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.

**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.

**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.

**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.

**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.

**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.

**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.

**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**
> I just have a question.

**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.

**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**
> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?

**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**
> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.

**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,

**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.

**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.

**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.

**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.

**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.

**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.

**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that would be one of the story.

**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they

**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.

**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.

**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.

**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.

**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, this is our website You

**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.

**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.

**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is the test.

**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If I search for Colombo, there he is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is the information we have.

**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.

**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.

**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.

**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.

**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There will be basically a member space and a public space.

**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.

**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.

**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.

**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.

**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will also say that once we have a directory.

**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to start encouraging members to become.

**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.

**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.

**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.

**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.

**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.

**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.

**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's 10.56.

**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have no other items that I really want to get to.

**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you everybody.

**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for being here.

**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, John.

> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.

**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.

**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.

**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**
> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.

**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.

**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**
> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.

**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**
> And then went on to do biology.

**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**
> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.

**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**
> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.

**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**
> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.

**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.

**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**
> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.

**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.

**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**
> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.

**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.

**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**
> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.

**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**
> So living material is an agential material.

**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**
> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.

**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**
> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.

**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**
> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.

**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**
> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.

**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**
> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.

**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**
> And specifically, want to emphasize

**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**
> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.

**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**
> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.

**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**
> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.

**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**
> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.

**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**
> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.

**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**
> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.

**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**
> And I will talk about that.

**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**
> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.

**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**
> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.

**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**
> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.

**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**
> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.

**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**
> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.

**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**
> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.

**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**
> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.

**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**
> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.

**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**
> I also think that this can.

**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**
> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.

**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**
> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.

**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**
> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.

**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**
> It actually gets much weirder than that.

**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**
> So let's begin.

**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.

**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**
> So there are a couple of things going on here.

**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**
> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.

**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**
> we know where

**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**
> all the animals are here.

**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**
> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.

**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**
> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.

**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**
> We know where all the minds are here.

**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**
> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.

**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**
> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.

**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**
> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?

**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't God do it?

**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?

**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**
> Why did Adam have to name the animals?

**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**
> I think there are two interesting things here.

**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**
> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.

**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**
> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.

**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**
> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.

**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**
> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have

**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**
> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.

**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**
> so that part we should stick with.

**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**
> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.

**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**
> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.

**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**
> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.

**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**
> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.

**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**
> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?

**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**
> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?

**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**
> How far back here would you like to extend it?

**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**
> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.

**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**
> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.

**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**
> How did you get from here to here.

**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**
> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.

**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**
> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.

**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**
> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.

**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**
> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.

**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**
> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.

**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**
> And you will have other kinds of beings.

**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**
> So we'll get to that.

**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**
> So I'm working on a framework.

**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**
> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.

**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**
> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.

**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**
> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.

**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**
> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.

**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**
> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.

**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**
> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.

**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**
> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.

**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**
> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?

**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**
> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.

**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**
> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.

**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**
> It has to be experimentally valuable.

**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**
> It has to move discovery forward.

**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**
> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.

**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.

**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**
> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...

**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**
> or pleasant or whatever.

**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**
> It actually has very practical consequences.

**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**
> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.

**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**
> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.

**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**
> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.

**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**
> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.

**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**
> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.

**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**
> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.

**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**
> and are trainable by experiences.

**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**
> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.

**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**
> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.

**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**
> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?

**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**
> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.

**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.

**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**
> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.

**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**
> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.

**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**
> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically

**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**
> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.

**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**
> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.

**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**
> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.

**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**
> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.

**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**
> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> scaling?

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?

**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**
> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.

**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**
> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?

**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**
> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.

**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**
> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked

**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**
> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems

**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**
> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.

**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**
> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**
> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.

**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**
> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.

**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**
> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.

**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**
> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.

**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**
> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.

**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**
> These kinds of systems navigate.

**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**
> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.

**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**
> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.

**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.

**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**
> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.

**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**
> and so on.

**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**
> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.

**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**
> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.

**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**
> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**
> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.

**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**
> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.

**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**
> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.

**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**
> Michael.

> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?

**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**
> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.

**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this works in real life.

**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**
> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**
> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.

**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**
> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.

**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**
> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.

**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**
> It really doesn't take much.

**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**
> And so going to,

**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**
> beyond the single cell level.

**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**
> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.

**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**
> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.

**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**
> This is a cross-section through an adult human.

**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**
> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.

**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**
> Where does this come from?

**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**
> How do these cells know to build all of this?

**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**
> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.

**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**
> We have this genome.

**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**
> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.

**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**
> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.

**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**
> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**
> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.

**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**
> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.

**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are the results of...

**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**
> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.

**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**
> So now we need to know a few things.

**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**
> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?

**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**
> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?

**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**
> How do they know when to stop?

**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**
> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?

**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**
> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?

**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**
> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?

**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**
> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.

**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**
> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.

**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**
> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?

**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**
> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.

**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**
> Now, the obvious biomedical.

**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**
> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.

**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**
> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.

**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**
> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.

**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**
> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.

**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**
> You're not going to try to micromanage this.

**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**
> This is a communications device.

**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**
> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.

**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**
> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.

**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**
> What is it capable of doing?

**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**
> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.

**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**
> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.

**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**
> let's get it back.

**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**
> And why is that?

**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**
> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.

**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**
> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.

**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**
> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.

**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**
> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.

**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**
> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.

**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**
> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.

**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**
> But all of this has not yet been exploited.

**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**
> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.

**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**
> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> some sense.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.

**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**
> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.

**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**
> So let's do a definition first.

**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**
> I like William James's definition of intelligence.

**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**
> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**
> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.

**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**
> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.

**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**
> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.

**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**
> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the

**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**
> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.

**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**
> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.

**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**
> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?

**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.

**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**
> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.

**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**
> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.

**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**
> What we have here is something different, which is that

**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**
> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.

**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**
> That's because the system can do something quite clever.

**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**
> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.

**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**
> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.

**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**
> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.

**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**
> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.

**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**
> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.

**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**
> And this is how these twins are naturally born.

**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**
> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.

**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**
> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.

**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**
> And if you amputate anywhere along this.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> this limb.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.

**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**
> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?

**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**
> So at any position, you can do this.

**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**
> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.

**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**
> That's the most amazing part of all of this.

**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**
> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> When does it stop?

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**
> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.

**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**
> You're here.

**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**
> It immediately recognizes the delta.

**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**
> It starts to reduce that error.

**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**
> So you've got an error minimization scheme.

**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**
> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.

**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**
> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.

**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**
> And this is how you recognize goals.

**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**
> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is

**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**
> its emergent complexity.

**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**
> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.

**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**
> That's not intelligence.

**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**
> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.

**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**
> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.

**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**
> And that's what happens here.

**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**
> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.

**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**
> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.

**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**
> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.

**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**
> Human livers are highly regenerative.

**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**
> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.

**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**
> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.

**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**
> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.

**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**
> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> things.

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.

**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**
> Here's where every cell goes.

**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**
> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.

**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**
> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?

**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**
> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?

**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**
> I'll show you both of those things.

**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**
> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?

**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**
> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.

**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**
> are they cooperating?

**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**
> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.

**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**
> So just imagine you've got this rat.

**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**
> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.

**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**
> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.

**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**
> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.

**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**
> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.

**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**
> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.

**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**
> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that

**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**
> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.

**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**
> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.

**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**
> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.

**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?

**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**
> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?

**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**
> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.

**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**
> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.

**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**
> It's the electrical network.

**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,

**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**
> is implemented by electrical networks.

**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**
> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**
> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.

**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**
> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.

**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**
> It's quite amazing.

**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**
> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.

**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**
> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.

**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**
> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.

**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**
> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.

**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**
> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.

**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**
> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> it turns

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.

**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**
> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.

**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**
> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.

**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**
> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.

**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**
> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.

**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**
> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.

**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**
> What were these networks thinking about?

**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**
> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?

**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.

**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**
> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.

**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**
> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.

**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**
> So this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**
> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.

**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**
> So this is not a simulation.

**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**
> This is real animal.

**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**
> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.

**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**
> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.

**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**
> I want to show you what they look like.

**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**
> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**
> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.

**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**
> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.

**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**
> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.

**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**
> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.

**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**
> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.

**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**
> This is where the mouth is going to go.

**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**
> There's some other placode structures that come out here.

**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**
> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.

**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**
> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.

**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**
> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.

**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**
> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop

**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**
> on it and to try to decode it.

**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**
> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.

**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**
> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.

**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**
> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.

**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**
> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.

**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**
> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.

**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**
> And we now have the tools.

**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**
> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.

**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**
> So now we can finally answer the question.

**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**
> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> How do they know?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.

**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**
> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.

**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**
> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?

**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**
> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.

**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**
> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.

**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**
> So from this, we learn three things.

**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**
> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.

**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**
> If you use those same

**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**
> signals elsewhere in the body.

**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**
> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.

**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**
> I could show you lots of other organs.

**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**
> Second, it's modular.

**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**
> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**
> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.

**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**
> We spoke to them at a very high level.

**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**
> We said, build an eye here.

**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**
> That is a very high level subroutine call.

**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**
> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.

**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**
> This is not micromanagement.

**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the genes.

**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the cells.

**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**
> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.

**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.

**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk later.

**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**
> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.

**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk about how you might do that.

**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**
> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...

**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**
> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.

**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**
> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?

**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**
> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.

**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**
> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.

**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**
> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.

**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**
> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of

**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**
> participants and so on.

**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**
> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about

**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**
> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.

**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**
> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.

**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**
> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.

**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**
> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us

**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**
> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.

**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**
> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.

**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**
> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.

**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**
> They are immortal.

**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**
> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.

**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**
> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.

**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**
> They've been around for 400 million years.

**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**
> These are them.

**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**
> They do not age and die.

**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**
> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.

**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**
> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.

**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**
> It's supposed to be the other way around.

**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**
> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.

**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**
> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.

**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**
> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.

**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**
> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?

**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**
> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.

**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**
> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.

**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**
> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?

**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**
> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.

**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**
> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.

**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**
> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.

**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**
> You can say, no, you should have two heads.

**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**
> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.

**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.

**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**
> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.

**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**
> This is not AI or Photoshop.

**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**
> These are real animals.

**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**
> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.

**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**
> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.

**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**
> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.

**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**
> Yep

**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.

**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> can do that.

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**
> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.

**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.

**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.

**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**
> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.

**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**
> This is this is their only now.

**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.

**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**
> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yep.

**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**
> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.

**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**
> Why?

**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**
> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could

**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**
> continuously cut them in plain water.

**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**
> No more manipulation of any kind.

**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**
> They remain two-headed.

**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**
> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.

**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**
> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.

**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**
> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.

**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**
> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.

**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**
> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?

**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**
> And the genomes are exactly identical.

**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing wrong with them.

**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**
> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?

**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**
> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.

**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**
> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.

**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**
> Not only can you, not only can you

**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**
> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.

**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**
> So these are derocephalus.

**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**
> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.

**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**
> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.

**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**
> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.

**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**
> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.

**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**
> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?

**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**
> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.

**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**
> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.

**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**
> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.

**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**
> You don't have to even be

**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**
> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.

**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**
> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.

**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**
> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.

**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**
> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.

**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**
> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.

**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**
> We would have never known that.

**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**
> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.

**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**
> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.

**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**
> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.

**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**
> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.

**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**
> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?

**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**
> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.

**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**
> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.

**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**
> So lots of evolution going on.

**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**
> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.

**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**
> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.

**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**
> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.

**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**
> They're put in a little depression.

**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**
> They could have done many things.

**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**
> They could have died.

**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**
> They could have spread away from each other.

**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**
> They could have formed a flat monolayer.

**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**
> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.

**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**
> We call it a xenobot.

**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**
> Xenobot because Xenopus later.

**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**
> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.

**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**
> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.

**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**
> So they're coordinated to swim.

**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**
> They can go in circles like this.

**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**
> They can go back and forth like this.

**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**
> And remember, this is just skin.

**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**
> There's no, these are epithelial cells.

**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**
> There is no neurons here.

**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing else.

**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**
> They have collective behaviors.

**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**
> They can interact with each other.

**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**
> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.

**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**
> They can have individual behaviors and so on.

**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**
> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.

**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**
> So it floats down here.

**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**
> It's swimming along.

**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**
> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.

**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**
> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.

**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**
> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff

**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**
> here are just the dissociated skin cells.

**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**
> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.

**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**
> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.

**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**
> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?

**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**
> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.

**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**
> This is called kinematic replication.

**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**
> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.

**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**
> This is completely novel.

**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**

**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**
> We did not have to force them to do this.

**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**
> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**
> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.

**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**
> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.

**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?

**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**
> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.

**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**
> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.

**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**
> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.

**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**
> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.

**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**
> They do have a developmental sequence.

**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**
> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.

**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**
> I have no idea.

**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**
> And they have these behaviors.

**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**
> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.

**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any xenobots.

**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.

**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**

**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.

**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**
> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.

**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**
> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings

> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.

**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**
> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.

**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**
> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.

**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**
> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.

**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**
> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for

**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**

> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.

**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**

**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are possible.

**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**
> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.

**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**
> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.

**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**

**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**
> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.

**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**
> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.

**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**
> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.

**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**
> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.

**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**
> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.

**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**
> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.

**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**
> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.

**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**
> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.

**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**
> I was looking for...

**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**
> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.

**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**
> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.

**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**
> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.

**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**
> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.

**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**
> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.

**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**
> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.

**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...

**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**
> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.

**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**
> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.

**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**
> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.

**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**
> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.

**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**
> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.

**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**
> imagine something.

**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**
> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.

**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**
> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.

**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**
> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.

**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**
> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.

**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**
> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.

**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**
> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.

**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**
> It's like a plasmode.

**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**
> very rarefied plasma.

**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**
> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.

**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**
> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.

**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**
> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.

**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**
> And we don't even see it.

**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of information.

**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**
> They're not real, like us.

**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**
> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.

**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**
> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.

**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**
> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.

**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**
> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.

**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**
> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.

**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**
> And the others say, well, that's crazy.

**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**
> We're real organisms.

**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**
> We're solid.

**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**
> Patterns in gas can't be agents.

**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**
> What do you mean patterns?

**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**
> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?

**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**
> says, well, about 100 years.

**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**
> But that's crazy.

**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**
> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.

**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**
> That's too short.

**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**
> so what I think

**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**
> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.

**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**
> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.

**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**
> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.

**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**
> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.

**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**
> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.

**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**
> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.

**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**
> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.

**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**
> these systems.

**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**
> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.

**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**
> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?

**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**
> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.

**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**
> So here's where I'll end.

**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**
> What I tried to tell you today is this.

**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**
> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.

**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**
> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.

**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**
> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.

**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**
> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.

**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**
> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.

**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**
> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.

**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**
> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.

**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**
> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.

**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.

**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**
> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.

**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**
> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.

**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**
> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.

**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**
> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.

**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**
> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.

**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**
> These are two companies that support this work.

**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**
> So I thank you.

**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Wow.

**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could- Thank you.

**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?

**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**
> I have a few minutes.

**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.

**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Really nice.

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to let other people go first.

**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm loaded with questions.

**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**
> Alex.

**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.

**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**
> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.

**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**
> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.

**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**
> So that's what takes me into biology.

**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**
> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.

**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**
> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.

**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**
> I think that's exactly right.

**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**
> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.

**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**
> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.

**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**
> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.

**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**
> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?

**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**
> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?

**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**
> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.

**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**
> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.

**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**
> But they can access these things.

**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**
> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.

**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**
> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?

**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**
> So last question, are we machines ourselves?

**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**
> Are we technologies of the natural world?

**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**
> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.

**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**
> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.

**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**
> This is not what machines are.

**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**
> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?

**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**
> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.

**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**
> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.

**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**
> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and

**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**
> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.

**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Both of those are true.

**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob?

**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**
> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.

**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, wonderful.

**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**
> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.

**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**
> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.

**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**
> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?

**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Good.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Good question.

**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**
> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.

**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**
> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.

**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**
> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.

**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**
> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.

**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**
> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.

**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**
> like this.

**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**
> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.

**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**
> Let's take that last example.

**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**
> So they donate their lung and their trachea.

**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**
> We buy those cells from a company.

**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**
> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.

**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**
> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.

**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**
> They look kind of like xenobots.

**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**
> They have some different behaviors.

**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**
> They have some amazing capabilities.

**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**
> They can heal neural wounds.

**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**
> do all kinds of wild stuff.

**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**
> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?

**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**
> So the original patient is perhaps dead.

**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**
> Their cells are not dead.

**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**
> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.

**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**
> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?

**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Where is this supposed to go?

**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**
> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,

**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**
> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.

**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**
> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.

**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**
> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.

**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**
> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.

**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**
> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.

**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**
> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.

**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**
> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.

**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**
> For example, we get tissue from smokers.

**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**
> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?

**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**
> You know, it's about a million questions.

**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**
> death is, yeah, I don't know.

**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**
> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.

**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**
> Wonderful, thank you.

**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks.

**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**
> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.

**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> And if so,

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?

**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**
> How are they being generated?

**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, great question.

**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**
> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.

**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**
> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.

**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**
> OK, let's say they don't.

**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**
> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.

**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**
> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.

**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**
> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?

**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**
> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.

**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**
> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?

**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.

**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**
> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?

**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**
> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.

**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**
> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.

**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**
> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**
> They get to the bottom.

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> What do they do?

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> make a beautiful bell curve, right?

**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**
> They make a Gaussian distribution.

**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**
> So now you can ask a simple question.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Okay, that's a nice shape.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Where did that come from?

**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**
> So you're looking at the marbles.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the nails.

**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the wood.

**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**
> Also not there.

**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**
> Where did it come from, right?

**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**
> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.

**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**
> Where is that?

**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**
> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.

**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**
> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.

**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**
> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?

**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**
> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.

**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> And that's great.

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> Well, guess what?

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> You don't need to look for the third angle.

**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**
> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.

**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**
> So where is that?

**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**
> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?

**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**
> This is not some philosophical fluff.

**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**
> This is super practical.

**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**
> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.

**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**
> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.

**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**

**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.

> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.

**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**
> I'm not sure.

**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**
> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.

**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My turn.

**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.

**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.

**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so bioelectric fields are dynamite.

**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.

**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.

**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.

**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> doesn't have to be.

**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?

**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.

**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**
> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.

**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**
> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?

**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**
> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.

**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**
> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.

**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**
> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.

**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**
> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.

**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**
> So, you know,

**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**
> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.

**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**
> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.

**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**
> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.

**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**
> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?

**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**
> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?

**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**
> Does it do anticipation?

**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**
> Does it do generalization?

**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**
> Does it do associative learning?

**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**
> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.

**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**
> We could start with models.

**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**
> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.

**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**
> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.

**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**
> And I think you can learn a lot from that.

**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.

**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.

**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.

**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**
> Sure, cool.

**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, thank you so much.

**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**
> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.

**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**
> you.

**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**
> All right, bye bye.

**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Deep breath.

**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for hanging in.

**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.

**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.

**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.

**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.

**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The steering committee looked at his proposal.

**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.

**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's really making progress.

**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.

**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.

**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He needs a mere another $4,500.

**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can we help him go over the edge?

**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.

**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.

**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.

**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.

**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The floor is yours.

**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.

**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.

**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah.

**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Thank you, John, and everyone.

**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I think my network is okay.

**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.

**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I know we are all exhausted.

**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to

**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.

**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.

**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.

**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a

**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.

**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.

**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.

**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.

**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.

**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.

**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.

**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Like currently, basically the characteristics.

**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.

**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.

**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.

**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so

**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.

**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.

**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.

**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.

**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.

**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.

**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.

**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.

**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.

**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.

**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.

**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is

**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.

**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.

**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.

**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.

**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.

**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.

**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.

**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> It can be

**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.

**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.

**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.

**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.

**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.

**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> culture, but you're doing other things.

**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.

**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.

**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.

**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.

**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.

**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar

**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> the region.

**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.

**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.

**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.

**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.

**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.

**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> because the number of land to be exploited.

**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.

**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.

**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.

**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.

**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.

**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.

**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's it.

**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.

**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.

**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...

**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.

**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.

**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after you command to national forest.

**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> that's why my last slide.

**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.

**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Before, make sure our dream comes true.

**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.

**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.

**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.

**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.

**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.

**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.

**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.

**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.

**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.

**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?

**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.

**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.

**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?

**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The cover trees and which one should be planted?

**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yes, as we're also making

**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.

**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.

**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.

**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.

**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob.

**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**
> I thank you for great work.

**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**
> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.

**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**
> The 2nd 1.

**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**
> You can ask that straight away.

**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will create.

**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> will.

**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.

**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.

**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the short answer to your question.

**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**
> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.

**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**
> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.

**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**
> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.

**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**
> I am certainly not an expert.

**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.

**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.

**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that is something.

**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a timely question.

**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.

**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.

**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin.

**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yes.

**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**
> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.

**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**
> That's very inspiring.

**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**
> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.

**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.

**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.

**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**
> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.

**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**
> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.

**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**
> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.

**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**
> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.

**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?

**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**
> What would a long-term region be for that?

**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.

**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.

**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some

**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so we will proceed with this.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.

**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.

**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the work here?

**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the actual planting?

**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do they get paid and so on?

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How does the labor component figure into this?

**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're

**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.

**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.

**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.

**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?

**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Okay.

**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.

**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.

**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.

**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> in our planning, we have

**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.

**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.

**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.

**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.

**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.

**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.

**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.

**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.

**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.

**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.

**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.

**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.

**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.

**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.

**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.

**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.

**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.

**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**
> I just have a question.

**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.

**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**
> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?

**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**
> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.

**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,

**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.

**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.

**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.

**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.

**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.

**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.

**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that would be one of the story.

**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they

**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.

**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.

**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.

**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.

**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, this is our website You

**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.

**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.

**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is the test.

**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If I search for Colombo, there he is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is the information we have.

**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.

**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.

**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.

**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.

**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There will be basically a member space and a public space.

**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.

**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.

**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.

**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.

**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will also say that once we have a directory.

**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to start encouraging members to become.

**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.

**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.

**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.

**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.

**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.

**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.

**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's 10.56.

**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have no other items that I really want to get to.

**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you everybody.

**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for being here.

**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, John.

> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.

**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.

**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.

**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been following you on social media.

**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.

**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.

**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.

**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.

**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.

**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**
> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.

**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.

**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**
> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.

**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**
> And then went on to do biology.

**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**
> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.

**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**
> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.

**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**
> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.

**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.

**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**
> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.

**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.

**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**
> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.

**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.

**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**
> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.

**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**
> So living material is an agential material.

**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**
> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.

**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**
> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.

**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**
> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.

**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**
> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.

**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**
> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.

**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**
> And specifically, want to emphasize

**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**
> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.

**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**
> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.

**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**
> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.

**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**
> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.

**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**
> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.

**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**
> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.

**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**
> And I will talk about that.

**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**
> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.

**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**
> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.

**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**
> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.

**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**
> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.

**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**
> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.

**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**
> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.

**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**
> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.

**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**
> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.

**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**
> I also think that this can.

**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**
> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.

**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**
> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.

**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**
> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.

**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**
> It actually gets much weirder than that.

**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**
> So let's begin.

**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.

**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**
> So there are a couple of things going on here.

**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**
> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.

**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**
> we know where

**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**
> all the animals are here.

**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**
> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.

**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**
> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.

**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**
> We know where all the minds are here.

**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**
> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.

**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**
> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.

**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**
> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?

**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't God do it?

**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?

**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**
> Why did Adam have to name the animals?

**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**
> I think there are two interesting things here.

**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**
> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.

**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**
> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.

**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**
> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.

**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**
> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have

**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**
> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.

**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**
> so that part we should stick with.

**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**
> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.

**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**
> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.

**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**
> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.

**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**
> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.

**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**
> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?

**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**
> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?

**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**
> How far back here would you like to extend it?

**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**
> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.

**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**
> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.

**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**
> How did you get from here to here.

**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**
> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.

**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**
> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.

**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**
> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.

**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**
> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.

**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**
> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.

**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**
> And you will have other kinds of beings.

**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**
> So we'll get to that.

**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**
> So I'm working on a framework.

**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**
> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.

**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**
> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.

**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**
> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.

**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**
> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.

**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**
> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.

**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**
> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.

**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**
> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.

**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**
> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?

**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**
> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.

**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**
> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.

**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**
> It has to be experimentally valuable.

**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**
> It has to move discovery forward.

**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**
> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.

**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.

**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**
> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...

**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**
> or pleasant or whatever.

**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**
> It actually has very practical consequences.

**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**
> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.

**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**
> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.

**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**
> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.

**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**
> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.

**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**
> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.

**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**
> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.

**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**
> and are trainable by experiences.

**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**
> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.

**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**
> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.

**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**
> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?

**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**
> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.

**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.

**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**
> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.

**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**
> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.

**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**
> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically

**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**
> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.

**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**
> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.

**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**
> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.

**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**
> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.

**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**
> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> scaling?

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?

**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**
> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.

**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**
> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?

**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**
> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.

**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**
> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked

**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**
> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems

**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**
> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.

**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**
> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**
> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.

**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**
> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.

**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**
> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.

**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**
> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.

**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**
> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.

**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**
> These kinds of systems navigate.

**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**
> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.

**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**
> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.

**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.

**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**
> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.

**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**
> and so on.

**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**
> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.

**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**
> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.

**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**
> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**
> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.

**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**
> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.

**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**
> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.

**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**
> Michael.

**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?

**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**
> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.

**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this works in real life.

**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**
> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**
> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.

**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**
> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.

**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**
> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.

**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**
> It really doesn't take much.

**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**
> And so going to,

**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**
> beyond the single cell level.

**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**
> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.

**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**
> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.

**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**
> This is a cross-section through an adult human.

**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**
> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.

**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**
> Where does this come from?

**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**
> How do these cells know to build all of this?

**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**
> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.

**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**
> We have this genome.

**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**
> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.

**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**
> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.

**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**
> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**
> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.

**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**
> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.

**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are the results of...

**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**
> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.

**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**
> So now we need to know a few things.

**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**
> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?

**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**
> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?

**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**
> How do they know when to stop?

**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**
> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?

**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**
> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?

**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**
> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?

**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**
> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.

**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**
> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.

**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**
> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?

**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**
> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.

**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**

**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**
> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.

**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**
> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.

**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**

**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**
> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.

**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**
> You're not going to try to micromanage this.

**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**
> This is a communications device.

**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**
> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.

**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**
> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.

**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**
> What is it capable of doing?

**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**
> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.

**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**
> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.

**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**
> let's get it back.

**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**
> And why is that?

**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**
> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.

**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**
> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.

**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**
> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.

**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**
> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.

**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**
> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.

**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**
> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.

**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**
> But all of this has not yet been exploited.

**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**
> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.

**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**
> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> some sense.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.

**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**
> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.

**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**
> So let's do a definition first.

**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**
> I like William James's definition of intelligence.

**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**
> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**
> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.

**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**
> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.

**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**
> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.

**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**
> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the

**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**
> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.

**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**
> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.

**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**
> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?

**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.

**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**
> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.

**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**
> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.

**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**
> What we have here is something different, which is that

**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**
> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.

**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**
> That's because the system can do something quite clever.

**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**
> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.

**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**
> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.

**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**
> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.

**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**
> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.

**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**
> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.

**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**
> And this is how these twins are naturally born.

**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**
> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.

**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**
> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.

**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**
> And if you amputate anywhere along this.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> this limb.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.

**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**
> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?

**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**
> So at any position, you can do this.

**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**
> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.

**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**
> That's the most amazing part of all of this.

**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**
> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> When does it stop?

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**
> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.

**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**
> You're here.

**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**
> It immediately recognizes the delta.

**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**
> It starts to reduce that error.

**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**
> So you've got an error minimization scheme.

**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**
> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.

**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**
> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.

**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**
> And this is how you recognize goals.

**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**
> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is

**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**
> its emergent complexity.

**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**
> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.

**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**
> That's not intelligence.

**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**
> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.

**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**
> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.

**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**
> And that's what happens here.

**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**
> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.

**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**
> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.

**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**
> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.

**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**
> Human livers are highly regenerative.

**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**
> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.

**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**
> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.

**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**
> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.

**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**
> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> things.

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.

**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**
> Here's where every cell goes.

**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**
> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.

**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**
> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?

**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**
> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?

**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**
> I'll show you both of those things.

**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**
> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?

**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**
> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.

**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**
> are they cooperating?

**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**
> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.

**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**
> So just imagine you've got this rat.

**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**
> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.

**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**
> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.

**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**
> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.

**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**
> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.

**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**
> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.

**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**
> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that

**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**
> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.

**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**
> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.

**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**
> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.

**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?

**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**
> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?

**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**
> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.

**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**
> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.

**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**
> It's the electrical network.

**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,

**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**
> is implemented by electrical networks.

**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**
> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**
> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.

**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**
> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.

**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**
> It's quite amazing.

**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**
> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.

**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**
> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.

**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**
> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.

**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**
> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.

**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**
> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.

**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**
> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> it turns

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.

**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**
> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.

**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**
> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.

**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**
> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.

**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**
> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.

**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**
> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.

**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**
> What were these networks thinking about?

**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**
> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?

**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.

**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**
> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.

**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**
> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.

**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**
> So this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**
> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.

**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**
> So this is not a simulation.

**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**
> This is real animal.

**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**
> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.

**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**
> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.

**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**
> I want to show you what they look like.

**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**
> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**
> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.

**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**
> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.

**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**
> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.

**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**
> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.

**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**
> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.

**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**
> This is where the mouth is going to go.

**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**
> There's some other placode structures that come out here.

**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**
> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.

**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**
> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.

**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**
> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.

**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**
> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop

**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**
> on it and to try to decode it.

**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**
> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.

**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**
> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.

**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**
> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.

**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**
> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.

**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**
> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.

**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**
> And we now have the tools.

**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**
> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.

**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**
> So now we can finally answer the question.

**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**
> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> How do they know?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.

**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**
> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.

**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**
> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?

**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**
> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.

**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**
> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.

**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**
> So from this, we learn three things.

**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**
> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.

**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**
> If you use those same

**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**
> signals elsewhere in the body.

**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**
> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.

**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**
> I could show you lots of other organs.

**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**
> Second, it's modular.

**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**
> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**
> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.

**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**
> We spoke to them at a very high level.

**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**
> We said, build an eye here.

**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**
> That is a very high level subroutine call.

**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**
> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.

**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**
> This is not micromanagement.

**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the genes.

**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the cells.

**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**
> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.

**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.

**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk later.

**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**
> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.

**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk about how you might do that.

**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**
> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...

**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**
> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.

**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**
> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?

**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**
> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.

**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**
> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.

**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**
> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.

**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**
> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of

**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**
> participants and so on.

**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**
> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about

**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**
> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.

**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**
> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.

**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**
> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.

**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**
> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us

**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**
> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.

**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**
> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.

**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**
> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.

**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**
> They are immortal.

**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**

**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**
> They've been around for 400 million years.

**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**
> These are them.

**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**
> They do not age and die.

**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**
> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.

**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**
> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.

**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**
> It's supposed to be the other way around.

**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**
> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.

**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**
> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.

**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**
> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.

**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**
> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?

**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**
> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.

**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**
> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.

**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**
> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?

**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**
> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.

**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**
> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.

**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**
> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.

**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**
> You can say, no, you should have two heads.

**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**
> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.

**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.

**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**
> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.

**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**
> This is not AI or Photoshop.

**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**
> These are real animals.

**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**
> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.

**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**
> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.

**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**
> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.

**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**
> Yep

**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.

**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> can do that.

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**
> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.

**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.

**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.

**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**
> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.

**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**
> This is this is their only now.

**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.

**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**
> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yep.

**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**
> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.

**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**
> Why?

**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**
> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could

**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**
> continuously cut them in plain water.

**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**
> No more manipulation of any kind.

**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**
> They remain two-headed.

**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**
> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.

**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**
> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.

**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**
> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.

**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**
> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.

**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**
> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?

**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**
> And the genomes are exactly identical.

**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing wrong with them.

**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**
> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?

**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**
> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.

**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**
> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.

**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**
> Not only can you, not only can you

**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**
> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.

**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**
> So these are derocephalus.

**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**
> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.

**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**
> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.

**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**
> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.

**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**
> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.

**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**
> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?

**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**
> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.

**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**
> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.

**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**
> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.

> You don't have to even be

**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**
> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.

**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**
> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.

**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**
> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.

**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**
> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.

**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**
> We would have never known that.

**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**
> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.

> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.

**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**
> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.

**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**
> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.

**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**
> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?

**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**
> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.

**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**
> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.

**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**
> So lots of evolution going on.

**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**
> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.

**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**
> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.

**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**
> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.

**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**
> They're put in a little depression.

**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**
> They could have done many things.

**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**
> They could have died.

**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**
> They could have spread away from each other.

**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**
> They could have formed a flat monolayer.

**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**
> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.

**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**
> We call it a xenobot.

**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**
> Xenobot because Xenopus later.

**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**
> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.

**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**
> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.

**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**
> So they're coordinated to swim.

**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**
> They can go in circles like this.

**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**
> They can go back and forth like this.

**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**
> And remember, this is just skin.

**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**
> There's no, these are epithelial cells.

**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**
> There is no neurons here.

**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing else.

**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**
> They have collective behaviors.

**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**
> They can interact with each other.

**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**
> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.

**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**
> They can have individual behaviors and so on.

**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**
> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.

**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**
> So it floats down here.

**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**
> It's swimming along.

**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**
> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.

**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**
> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.

**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**
> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff

**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**
> here are just the dissociated skin cells.

**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**
> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.

**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**
> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.

**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**
> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?

**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**
> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.

**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**
> This is called kinematic replication.

**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**
> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.

**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**
> This is completely novel.

**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**

**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**
> We did not have to force them to do this.

**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**
> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**
> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.

**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**
> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.

**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?

**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**
> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.

**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**
> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.

**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**
> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.

**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**
> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.

**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**
> They do have a developmental sequence.

**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**
> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.

**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**
> I have no idea.

**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**
> And they have these behaviors.

**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**
> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.

**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any xenobots.

**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**

**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**
> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.

**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**
> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings

**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**
> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.

**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**
> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.

**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**

**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**

**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**

**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**
> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.

**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**

> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.

**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**
> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.

**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**
> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.

**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**
> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.

**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**
> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.

**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**
> these systems.

**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**
> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.

**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**
> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?

**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**
> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.

**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**
> So here's where I'll end.

**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**
> What I tried to tell you today is this.

**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**
> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.

**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**
> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.

**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**
> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.

**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**
> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.

**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**
> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.

**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**
> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.

**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**
> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.

**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**
> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.

**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.

**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**
> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.

**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**
> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.

**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**
> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.

**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**
> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.

**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**
> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.

**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**
> These are two companies that support this work.

**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**
> So I thank you.

**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Wow.

**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could- Thank you.

**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?

**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**
> I have a few minutes.

**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.

**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Really nice.

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to let other people go first.

**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm loaded with questions.

**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**
> Alex.

**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.

**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**
> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.

**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**
> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.

**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**
> So that's what takes me into biology.

**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**
> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.

**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**
> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.

**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**
> I think that's exactly right.

**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**
> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.

**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**
> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.

**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**
> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.

**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**
> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?

**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**
> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?

**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**
> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.

**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**
> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.

**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**
> But they can access these things.

**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**
> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.

**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**
> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?

**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**
> So last question, are we machines ourselves?

**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**
> Are we technologies of the natural world?

**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**
> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.

**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**
> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.

**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**
> This is not what machines are.

**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**
> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?

**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**
> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.

**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**
> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.

**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**
> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and

**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**
> function, at the same time we have very high levels of agency in our perspective and so on.

**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Both of those are true.

**[01:18:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob?

**[01:18:12] Rob De Laet**
> Oh, yeah, thank you, Michael.

**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, wonderful.

**[01:18:16] Rob De Laet**
> I have to call my hair after this because of the storm of information that you let loose on us.

**[01:18:22] Rob De Laet**
> however, I'm still sitting in my chair.

**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**
> I just have a one question I could have had many, and it is how would you describe individual death in in your way of thinking?

**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Good.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Good question.

**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**
> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.

**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**
> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.

**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**
> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.

**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**
> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.

**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**
> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.

**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**
> like this.

**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**
> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.

**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**
> Let's take that last example.

**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**
> So they donate their lung and their trachea.

**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**
> We buy those cells from a company.

**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**
> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.

**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**
> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.

**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**
> They look kind of like xenobots.

**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**
> They have some different behaviors.

**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**
> They have some amazing capabilities.

**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**
> They can heal neural wounds.

**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**
> do all kinds of wild stuff.

**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**
> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?

**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**
> So the original patient is perhaps dead.

**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**
> Their cells are not dead.

**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**
> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.

**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**
> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?

**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Where is this supposed to go?

**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**
> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,

**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**
> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.

**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**
> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.

**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**
> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.

**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**
> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.

**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**
> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.

**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**
> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.

**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**
> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.

**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**
> For example, we get tissue from smokers.

**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**
> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?

**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**
> You know, it's about a million questions.

**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**
> death is, yeah, I don't know.

**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**
> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.

**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**
> Wonderful, thank you.

**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks.

**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**
> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.

**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> And if so,

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?

**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**
> How are they being generated?

**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, great question.

**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**
> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.

**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**
> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.

**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**
> OK, let's say they don't.

**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**
> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.

**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**
> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.

**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**
> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?

**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**
> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.

**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**
> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?

**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.

**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**
> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?

**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**
> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.

**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**
> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.

**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**
> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**
> They get to the bottom.

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> What do they do?

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> make a beautiful bell curve, right?

**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**
> They make a Gaussian distribution.

**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**
> So now you can ask a simple question.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Okay, that's a nice shape.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Where did that come from?

**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**
> So you're looking at the marbles.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the nails.

**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the wood.

**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**
> Also not there.

**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**
> Where did it come from, right?

**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**
> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.

**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**
> Where is that?

**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**
> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.

**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**
> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.

**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**
> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?

**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**
> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.

**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**
> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> And that's great.

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> Well, guess what?

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> You don't need to look for the third angle.

**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**
> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.

**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**
> So where is that?

**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**
> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?

**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**
> This is not some philosophical fluff.

**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**
> This is super practical.

**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**
> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.

**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**
> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.

**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**

**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.

**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**

**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.

**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**

**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**
> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?

**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**

**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for hanging in.

**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't even know how to, how to transition from that.

**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.

**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.

**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.

**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The steering committee looked at his proposal.

**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.

**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's really making progress.

**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.

**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.

**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He needs a mere another $4,500.

**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can we help him go over the edge?

**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.

**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.

**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.

**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.

**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The floor is yours.

**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.

**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.

**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah.

**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Thank you, John, and everyone.

**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I think my network is okay.

**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.

**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I know we are all exhausted.

**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to

**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.

**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.

**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.

**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a

**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.

**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.

**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.

**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.

**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.

**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.

**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.

**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Like currently, basically the characteristics.

**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.

**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.

**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.

**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so

**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.

**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.

**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.

**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.

**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.

**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.

**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.

**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.

**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.

**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.

**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.

**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is

**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.

**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.

**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.

**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.

**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.

**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.

**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.

**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> It can be

**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.

**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.

**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.

**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.

**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.

**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> culture, but you're doing other things.

**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.

**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.

**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.

**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.

**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.

**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar

**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> the region.

**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.

**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.

**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.

**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.

**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.

**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> because the number of land to be exploited.

**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.

**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.

**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.

**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.

**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.

**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.

**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's it.

**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.

**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.

**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...

**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.

**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.

**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after you command to national forest.

**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> that's why my last slide.

**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.

**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Before, make sure our dream comes true.

**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.

**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.

**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.

**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.

**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.

**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.

**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.

**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.

**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.

**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?

**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.

**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.

**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?

**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The cover trees and which one should be planted?

**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yes, as we're also making

**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.

**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.

**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.

**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.

**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob.

**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**
> I thank you for great work.

**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**
> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.

**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**
> The 2nd 1.

**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**
> You can ask that straight away.

**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will create.

**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> will.

**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.

**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.

**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the short answer to your question.

**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**
> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.

**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**
> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.

**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**
> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.

**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**
> I am certainly not an expert.

**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.

**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.

**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that is something.

**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a timely question.

**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.

**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.

**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin.

**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yes.

**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**
> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.

**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**
> That's very inspiring.

**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**
> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.

**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.

**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.

**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**
> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.

**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**
> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.

**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**
> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.

**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**
> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.

**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?

**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**
> What would a long-term region be for that?

**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.

**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.

**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some

**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so we will proceed with this.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.

**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.

**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the work here?

**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the actual planting?

**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do they get paid and so on?

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How does the labor component figure into this?

**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're

**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.

**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.

**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.

**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?

**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Okay.

**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.

**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.

**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.

**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> in our planning, we have

**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.

**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.

**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.

**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.

**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.

**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.

**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.

**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.

**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.

**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.

**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.

**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.

**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.

**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.

**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.

**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.

**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.

**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**
> I just have a question.

**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.

**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**
> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?

**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**
> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.

**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,

**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.

**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.

**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.

**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.

**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.

**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.

**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that would be one of the story.

**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they

**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.

**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.

**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.

**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.

**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, this is our website You

**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.

**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.

**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is the test.

**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If I search for Colombo, there he is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is the information we have.

**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.

**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.

**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.

**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.

**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There will be basically a member space and a public space.

**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.

**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.

**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.

**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.

**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will also say that once we have a directory.

**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to start encouraging members to become.

**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.

**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.

**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.

**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.

**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.

**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.

**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's 10.56.

**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have no other items that I really want to get to.

**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you everybody.

**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for being here.

**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, John.

**[00:07:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is where you.

**[00:08:01] Rob De Laet**
> I'm in Amsterdam.

**[00:08:03] Rob De Laet**
> Hello everybody.

**[00:08:05] Rob De Laet**
> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.

**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.

**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.

**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, hello, Kwaki.

**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning.

**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning, everybody.

**[00:09:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Pierre, associated with Alex by this is my memory test, my mental status exam.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.

**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been following you on social media.

**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.

**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.

**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ali bin Shahid.

**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.

**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.

**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.

**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.

**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.

**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.

**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.

**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.

**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**
> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.

**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.

**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**
> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.

**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**
> And then went on to do biology.

**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**
> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.

**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**
> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.

**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**
> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.

**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.

**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**
> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.

**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.

**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**
> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.

**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.

**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**
> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.

**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**
> So living material is an agential material.

**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**
> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.

**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**
> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.

**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**
> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.

**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**
> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.

**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**
> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.

**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**
> And specifically, want to emphasize

**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**
> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.

**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**
> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.

**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**
> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.

**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**
> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.

**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**
> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.

**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**
> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.

**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**
> And I will talk about that.

**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**
> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.

**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**
> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.

**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**
> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.

**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**
> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.

**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**
> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.

**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**
> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.

**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**
> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.

**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**
> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.

**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**
> I also think that this can.

**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**
> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.

**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**
> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.

**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**
> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.

**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**
> It actually gets much weirder than that.

**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**
> So let's begin.

**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.

**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**
> So there are a couple of things going on here.

**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**
> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.

**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**
> we know where

**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**
> all the animals are here.

**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**
> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.

**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**
> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.

**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**
> We know where all the minds are here.

**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**
> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.

**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**
> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.

**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**
> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?

**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't God do it?

**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?

**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**
> Why did Adam have to name the animals?

**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**
> I think there are two interesting things here.

**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**
> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.

**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**
> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.

**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**
> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.

**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**
> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have

**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**
> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.

**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**
> so that part we should stick with.

**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**
> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.

**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**
> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.

**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**
> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.

**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**
> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.

**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**
> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?

**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**
> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?

**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**
> How far back here would you like to extend it?

**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**
> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.

**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**
> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.

**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**
> How did you get from here to here.

**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**
> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.

**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**
> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.

**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**
> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.

**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**
> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.

**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**
> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.

**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**
> And you will have other kinds of beings.

**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**
> So we'll get to that.

**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**
> So I'm working on a framework.

**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**
> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.

**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**
> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.

**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**
> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.

**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**
> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.

**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**
> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.

**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**
> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.

**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**
> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.

**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**
> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?

**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**
> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.

**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**
> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.

**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**
> It has to be experimentally valuable.

**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**
> It has to move discovery forward.

**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**
> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.

**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.

**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**
> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...

**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**
> or pleasant or whatever.

**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**
> It actually has very practical consequences.

**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**
> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.

**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**
> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.

**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**
> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.

**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**
> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.

**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**
> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.

**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**
> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.

**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**
> and are trainable by experiences.

**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**
> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.

**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**
> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.

**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**
> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?

**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**
> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.

**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.

**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**
> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.

**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**
> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.

**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**
> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically

**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**
> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.

**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**
> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.

**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**
> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.

**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**
> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.

**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**
> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> scaling?

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?

**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**
> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.

**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**
> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?

**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**
> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.

**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**
> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked

**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**
> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems

**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**
> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.

**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**
> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**
> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.

**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**
> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.

**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**
> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.

**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**
> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.

**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**
> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.

**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**
> These kinds of systems navigate.

**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**
> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.

**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**
> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.

**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.

**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**
> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.

**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**
> and so on.

**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**
> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.

**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**
> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.

**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**
> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**
> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.

**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**
> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.

**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**
> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.

**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**
> Michael.

**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?

**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**
> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.

**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this works in real life.

**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**
> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**
> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.

**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**
> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.

**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**
> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.

**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**
> It really doesn't take much.

**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**
> And so going to,

**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**
> beyond the single cell level.

**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**
> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.

**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**
> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.

**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**
> This is a cross-section through an adult human.

**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**
> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.

**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**
> Where does this come from?

**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**
> How do these cells know to build all of this?

**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**
> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.

**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**
> We have this genome.

**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**
> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.

**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**
> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.

**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**
> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**
> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.

**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**
> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.

**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are the results of...

**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**
> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.

**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**
> So now we need to know a few things.

**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**
> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?

**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**
> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?

**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**
> How do they know when to stop?

**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**
> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?

**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**
> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?

**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**
> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?

**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**
> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.

**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**
> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.

**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**
> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?

**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**
> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.

**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**
> Now, the obvious biomedical.

**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**
> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.

**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**
> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.

**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**
> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.

**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**
> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.

**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**
> You're not going to try to micromanage this.

**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**
> This is a communications device.

**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**
> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.

**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**
> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.

**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**
> What is it capable of doing?

**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**
> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.

**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**
> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.

**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**
> let's get it back.

**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**
> And why is that?

**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**
> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.

**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**
> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.

**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**
> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.

**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**
> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.

**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**
> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.

**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**
> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.

**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**
> But all of this has not yet been exploited.

**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**
> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.

**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**
> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> some sense.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.

**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**
> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.

**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**
> So let's do a definition first.

**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**
> I like William James's definition of intelligence.

**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**
> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**
> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.

**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**
> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.

**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**
> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.

**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**
> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the

**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**
> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.

**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**
> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.

**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**
> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?

**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.

**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**
> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.

**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**
> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.

**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**
> What we have here is something different, which is that

**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**
> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.

**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**
> That's because the system can do something quite clever.

**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**
> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.

**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**
> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.

**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**
> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.

**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**
> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.

**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**
> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.

**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**
> And this is how these twins are naturally born.

**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**
> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.

**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**
> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.

**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**
> And if you amputate anywhere along this.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> this limb.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.

**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**
> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?

**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**
> So at any position, you can do this.

**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**
> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.

**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**
> That's the most amazing part of all of this.

**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**
> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> When does it stop?

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**
> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.

**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**
> You're here.

**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**
> It immediately recognizes the delta.

**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**
> It starts to reduce that error.

**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**
> So you've got an error minimization scheme.

**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**
> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.

**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**
> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.

**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**
> And this is how you recognize goals.

**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**
> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is

**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**
> its emergent complexity.

**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**
> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.

**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**
> That's not intelligence.

**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**
> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.

**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**
> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.

**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**
> And that's what happens here.

**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**
> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.

**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**
> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.

**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**
> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.

**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**
> Human livers are highly regenerative.

**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**
> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.

**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**
> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.

**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**
> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.

**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**
> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> things.

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.

**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**
> Here's where every cell goes.

**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**
> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.

**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**
> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?

**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**
> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?

**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**
> I'll show you both of those things.

**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**
> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?

**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**
> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.

**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**
> are they cooperating?

**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**
> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.

**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**
> So just imagine you've got this rat.

**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**
> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.

**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**
> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.

**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**
> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.

**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**
> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.

**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**
> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.

**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**
> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that

**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**
> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.

**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**
> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.

**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**
> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.

**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?

**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**
> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?

**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**
> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.

**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**
> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.

**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**
> It's the electrical network.

**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,

**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**
> is implemented by electrical networks.

**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**
> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**
> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.

**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**
> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.

**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**
> It's quite amazing.

**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**
> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.

**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**
> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.

**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**
> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.

**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**
> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.

**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**
> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.

**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**
> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> it turns

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.

**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**
> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.

**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**
> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.

**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**
> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.

**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**
> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.

**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**
> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.

**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**
> What were these networks thinking about?

**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**
> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?

**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.

**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**
> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.

**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**
> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.

**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**
> So this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**
> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.

**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**
> So this is not a simulation.

**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**
> This is real animal.

**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**
> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.

**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**
> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.

**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**
> I want to show you what they look like.

**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**
> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**
> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.

**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**
> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.

**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**
> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.

**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**
> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.

**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**
> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.

**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**
> This is where the mouth is going to go.

**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**
> There's some other placode structures that come out here.

**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**
> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.

**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**
> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.

**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**
> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.

**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**
> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop

**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**
> on it and to try to decode it.

**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**
> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.

**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**
> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.

**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**
> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.

**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**
> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.

**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**
> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.

**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**
> And we now have the tools.

**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**
> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.

**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**
> So now we can finally answer the question.

**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**
> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> How do they know?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.

**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**
> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.

**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**
> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?

**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**
> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.

**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**
> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.

**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**
> So from this, we learn three things.

**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**
> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.

**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**
> If you use those same

**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**
> signals elsewhere in the body.

**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**
> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.

**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**
> I could show you lots of other organs.

**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**
> Second, it's modular.

**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**
> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**
> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.

**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**
> We spoke to them at a very high level.

**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**
> We said, build an eye here.

**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**
> That is a very high level subroutine call.

**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**
> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.

**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**
> This is not micromanagement.

**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the genes.

**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the cells.

**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**
> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.

**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.

**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk later.

**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**
> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.

**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk about how you might do that.

**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**
> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...

**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**
> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.

**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**
> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?

**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**
> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.

**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**
> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.

**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**
> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.

**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**
> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of

**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**
> participants and so on.

**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**
> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about

**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**
> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.

**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**
> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.

**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**
> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.

**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**
> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us

**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**
> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.

**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**
> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.

**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**
> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.

**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**
> They are immortal.

**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**
> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.

**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**
> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.

**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**
> They've been around for 400 million years.

**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**
> These are them.

**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**
> They do not age and die.

**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**
> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.

**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**
> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.

**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**
> It's supposed to be the other way around.

**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**
> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.

**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**
> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.

**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**
> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.

**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**
> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?

**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**
> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.

**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**
> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.

**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**
> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?

**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**
> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.

**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**
> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.

**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**
> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.

**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**
> You can say, no, you should have two heads.

**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**
> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.

**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.

**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**
> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.

**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**
> This is not AI or Photoshop.

**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**
> These are real animals.

**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**
> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.

**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**
> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.

**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**
> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.

**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**
> Yep

**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.

**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> can do that.

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**
> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.

**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.

**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.

**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**
> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.

**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**
> This is this is their only now.

**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.

**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**
> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yep.

**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**
> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.

**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**
> Why?

**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**
> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could

**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**
> continuously cut them in plain water.

**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**
> No more manipulation of any kind.

**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**
> They remain two-headed.

**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**
> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.

**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**
> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.

**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**
> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.

**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**
> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.

**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**
> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?

**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**
> And the genomes are exactly identical.

**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing wrong with them.

**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**
> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?

**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**
> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.

**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**
> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.

**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**
> Not only can you, not only can you

**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**
> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.

**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**
> So these are derocephalus.

**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**
> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.

**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**
> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.

**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**
> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.

**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**
> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.

**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**
> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?

**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**
> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.

**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**
> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.

**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**
> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.

**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**
> You don't have to even be

**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**
> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.

**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**
> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.

**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**
> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.

**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**
> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.

**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**
> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.

**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**
> We would have never known that.

**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**
> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.

**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**
> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.

**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**
> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.

**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**
> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.

**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**
> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?

**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**
> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.

**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**
> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.

**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**
> So lots of evolution going on.

**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**
> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.

**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**
> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.

**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**
> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.

**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**
> They're put in a little depression.

**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**
> They could have done many things.

**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**
> They could have died.

**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**
> They could have spread away from each other.

**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**
> They could have formed a flat monolayer.

**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**
> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.

**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**
> We call it a xenobot.

**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**
> Xenobot because Xenopus later.

**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**
> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.

**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**
> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.

**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**
> So they're coordinated to swim.

**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**
> They can go in circles like this.

**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**
> They can go back and forth like this.

**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**
> And remember, this is just skin.

**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**
> There's no, these are epithelial cells.

**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**
> There is no neurons here.

**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing else.

**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**
> They have collective behaviors.

**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**
> They can interact with each other.

**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**
> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.

**[01:01:36] Michael Levin**
> They can have individual behaviors and so on.

**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**
> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.

**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**
> So it floats down here.

**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**
> It's swimming along.

**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**
> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.

**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**
> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.

**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**
> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff

**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**
> here are just the dissociated skin cells.

**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**
> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.

**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**
> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.

**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**
> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?

**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**
> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.

**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**
> This is called kinematic replication.

**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**
> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.

**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**
> This is completely novel.

**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**
> We did not teach them to do this.

**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**
> We did not have to force them to do this.

**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**
> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**
> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.

**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**
> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.

**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?

**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**
> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.

**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**
> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.

**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**
> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.

**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**
> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.

**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**
> They do have a developmental sequence.

**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**
> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.

**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**
> I have no idea.

**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**
> And they have these behaviors.

**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**
> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.

**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any xenobots.

**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.

**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any kinematic replication.

**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**
> All of this emerges spontaneously.

**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**
> It's not just complexity.

**[01:03:46] Michael Levin**
> It's the ability to put together a coherent organism with adaptive behaviors that functions in novel circumstances you've never seen before.

> really have to understand, and by the way, we're studying their cognitive capacities, you know, can learn, can they remember, stay tuned, we have a paper coming on that in a few months.

**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.

**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**
> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.

**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**
> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings

**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**
> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.

**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**
> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.

**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**
> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.

**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**
> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.

**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**
> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for

**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**
> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.

**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**
> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.

**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**
> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.

**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are possible.

**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**
> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.

**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**
> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.

**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**
> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.

**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**
> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.

**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**
> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.

**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**
> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.

**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**
> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.

**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**
> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.

**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**
> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.

**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**
> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.

**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**
> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.

**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**
> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.

**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**
> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.

**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**
> I was looking for...

**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**
> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.

**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**
> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.

**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**
> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.

**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**
> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.

**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**
> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.

**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**
> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.

**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...

**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**
> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.

**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**
> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.

**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**
> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.

**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**
> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.

**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**
> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.

**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**
> imagine something.

**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**
> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.

**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**
> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.

**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**
> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.

**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**
> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.

**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**
> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.

**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**
> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.

**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**
> It's like a plasmode.

**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**
> very rarefied plasma.

**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**
> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.

**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**
> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.

**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**
> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.

**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**
> And we don't even see it.

**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of information.

**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**
> They're not real, like us.

**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**
> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.

**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**
> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.

**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**
> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.

**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**
> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.

**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**
> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.

**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**
> And the others say, well, that's crazy.

**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**
> We're real organisms.

**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**
> We're solid.

**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**
> Patterns in gas can't be agents.

**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**
> What do you mean patterns?

**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**
> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?

**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**
> says, well, about 100 years.

**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**
> But that's crazy.

**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**
> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.

**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**
> That's too short.

**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**
> so what I think

**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**
> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.

**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**
> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.

**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**
> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.

**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**
> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.

**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**
> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.

**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**
> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.

**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**
> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.

**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**
> these systems.

**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**
> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.

**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**
> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?

**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**
> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.

**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**
> So here's where I'll end.

**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**
> What I tried to tell you today is this.

**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**
> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.

**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**
> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.

**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**
> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.

**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**
> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.

**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**
> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.

**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**
> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.

**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**
> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.

**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**
> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.

**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.

**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**
> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.

**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**
> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.

**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**
> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.

**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**
> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.

**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**

**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**

**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**
> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.

**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**
> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?

**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**
> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?

**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**
> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.

**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**
> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.

**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**
> But they can access these things.

**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**

**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**
> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?

**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**
> So last question, are we machines ourselves?

**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**
> Are we technologies of the natural world?

**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**
> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.

**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**
> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.

**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**
> This is not what machines are.

**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**
> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?

**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**
> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.

**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**
> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.

**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**
> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and

**[01:18:00] Michael Levin**

**[01:18:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:18:24] Rob De Laet**

**[01:18:39] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Good.

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**
> Good question.

**[01:18:41] Michael Levin**
> If you email me, I'll send you a link to a blog post I wrote about this topic.

**[01:18:45] Michael Levin**
> So, so let me let me give you just just one example of death.

**[01:18:49] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:18:50] Michael Levin**
> I've shown you I've shown you Xenobots.

**[01:18:52] Michael Levin**
> What I haven't shown you is the data that we have on Anthrobots.

**[01:18:55] Michael Levin**
> So, Anthrobots are Biobots made of adult human cells and the way it works.

**[01:19:00] Michael Levin**
> like this.

**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**
> An adult patient, young, maybe in their 80s, maybe still alive, maybe this is a tissue donation after death.

**[01:19:08] Michael Levin**
> Let's take that last example.

**[01:19:10] Michael Levin**
> So they donate their lung and their trachea.

**[01:19:13] Michael Levin**
> We buy those cells from a company.

**[01:19:15] Michael Levin**
> We have a protocol in which those cells get to reboot their multicellularity.

**[01:19:20] Michael Levin**
> And what they do is they form into little proto organisms.

**[01:19:22] Michael Levin**
> They look kind of like xenobots.

**[01:19:23] Michael Levin**
> They have some different behaviors.

**[01:19:25] Michael Levin**
> They have some amazing capabilities.

**[01:19:26] Michael Levin**
> They can heal neural wounds.

**[01:19:28] Michael Levin**
> do all kinds of wild stuff.

**[01:19:30] Michael Levin**
> Now the question, who died and who's still alive?

**[01:19:35] Michael Levin**
> So the original patient is perhaps dead.

**[01:19:39] Michael Levin**
> Their cells are not dead.

**[01:19:41] Michael Levin**
> in fact, there's a whole field of research on the Thanato transcriptome, which are the genes that get turned on at death.

**[01:19:48] Michael Levin**
> And so you might ask yourself, why are cells turning on genes at death?

**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Where is this supposed to go?

**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**
> And I think what this is, is the realization that, at least in the case of aquatic organisms,

**[01:20:00] Michael Levin**
> If the organism dies, the cells don't need to die.

**[01:20:02] Michael Levin**
> When a frog or fish dies, most of the cells are fine.

**[01:20:04] Michael Levin**
> They could go off and they could live as amoebas, as xenobots, whatever.

**[01:20:09] Michael Levin**
> In mammals, that doesn't work too well because in the absence of a bioengineer like us, it's dry air and you're not gonna live.

**[01:20:15] Michael Levin**
> But we sort of midwife them into a new world.

**[01:20:18] Michael Levin**
> so now you have the cells and they're kind of alive.

**[01:20:21] Michael Levin**
> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.

**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**
> For example, we get tissue from smokers.

**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**
> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?

**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**
> You know, it's about a million questions.

**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**
> death is, yeah, I don't know.

**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**
> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.

**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**
> Wonderful, thank you.

**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks.

**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> And if so,

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?

**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**
> How are they being generated?

**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, great question.

**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**
> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.

**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**
> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.

**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**
> OK, let's say they don't.

**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**
> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.

**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**
> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.

**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**
> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?

**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**
> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.

**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**
> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?

**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.

**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**
> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?

**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**
> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.

**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**
> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.

**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**
> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**
> They get to the bottom.

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> What do they do?

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> make a beautiful bell curve, right?

**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**
> They make a Gaussian distribution.

**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**
> So now you can ask a simple question.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Okay, that's a nice shape.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Where did that come from?

**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**
> So you're looking at the marbles.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the nails.

**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the wood.

**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**
> Also not there.

**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**
> Where did it come from, right?

**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**
> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.

**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**
> Where is that?

**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**
> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.

**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**
> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.

**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**
> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?

**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**
> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.

**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**
> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> And that's great.

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> Well, guess what?

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> You don't need to look for the third angle.

**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**
> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.

**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**
> So where is that?

**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**
> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?

**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**
> This is not some philosophical fluff.

**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**
> This is super practical.

**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**
> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.

**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**
> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.

**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**
> there are three things we need to track.

**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.

**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.

**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**
> I'm not sure.

**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**

**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> doesn't have to be.

**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?

**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.

**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**
> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.

**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**
> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?

**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**
> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.

**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**
> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.

**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**
> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.

**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**

**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**

> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.

**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.

**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.

**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Like currently, basically the characteristics.

**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.

**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.

**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.

**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so

**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.

**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.

**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.

**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.

**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.

**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.

**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.

**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.

**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.

**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.

**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.

**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is

**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.

**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.

**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.

**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.

**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.

**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.

**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.

**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> It can be

**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.

**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.

**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.

**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.

**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.

**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> culture, but you're doing other things.

**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.

**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.

**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.

**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.

**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.

**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar

**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> the region.

**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.

**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.

**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.

**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.

**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.

**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> because the number of land to be exploited.

**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.

**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.

**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.

**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.

**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.

**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.

**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's it.

**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.

**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.

**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...

**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.

**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.

**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after you command to national forest.

**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> that's why my last slide.

**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.

**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Before, make sure our dream comes true.

**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.

**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.

**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.

**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.

**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.

**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.

**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.

**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.

**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.

**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?

**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.

**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.

**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?

**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The cover trees and which one should be planted?

**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yes, as we're also making

**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.

**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.

**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.

**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.

**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob.

**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**
> I thank you for great work.

**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**
> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.

**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**
> The 2nd 1.

**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**
> You can ask that straight away.

**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will create.

**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> will.

**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.

**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.

**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the short answer to your question.

**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**
> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.

**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**
> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.

**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**
> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.

**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**
> I am certainly not an expert.

**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.

**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.

**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that is something.

**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a timely question.

**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.

**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.

**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin.

**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yes.

**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**
> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.

**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**
> That's very inspiring.

**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**
> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.

**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.

**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.

**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**
> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.

**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**
> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.

**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**
> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.

**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**
> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.

**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?

**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**
> What would a long-term region be for that?

**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.

**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.

**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some

**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so we will proceed with this.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.

**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.

**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the work here?

**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the actual planting?

**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do they get paid and so on?

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How does the labor component figure into this?

**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're

**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.

**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.

**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.

**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?

**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Okay.

**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.

**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.

**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.

**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> in our planning, we have

**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.

**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.

**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.

**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.

**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.

**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.

**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.

**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.

**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.

**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.

**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.

**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.

**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.

**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.

**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.

**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.

**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.

**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**
> I just have a question.

**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.

**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**
> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?

**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**
> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.

**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,

**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.

**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.

**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.

**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.

**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.

**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.

**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that would be one of the story.

**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they

**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.

**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.

**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.

**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.

**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, this is our website You

**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.

**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.

**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is the test.

**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If I search for Colombo, there he is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is the information we have.

**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.

**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.

**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.

**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.

**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There will be basically a member space and a public space.

**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.

**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.

**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.

**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.

**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will also say that once we have a directory.

**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to start encouraging members to become.

**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.

**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.

**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.

**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.

**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.

**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.

**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's 10.56.

**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have no other items that I really want to get to.

**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you everybody.

**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for being here.

**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, John.

**[00:07:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob delay.

**[00:07:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:07:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is where you.

**[00:08:01] Rob De Laet**
> I'm in Amsterdam.

**[00:08:03] Rob De Laet**
> Hello everybody.

**[00:08:05] Rob De Laet**
> I call myself a climate strategist and I've been doing extensive work to and telling the story that we can actually stop the planet from heating up within 20 years with nature-based solutions and I think we're sort of all doing a little part of that but I think the overall story is very important so that's what I'm pushing whenever I can.

**[00:08:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:08:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've just put the link to the agenda into the chat and in the agenda are links to two recent proposals that Robin and I both worked on in the last few weeks.

**[00:08:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One to the Bezos Earth Fund and one to the Templeton Foundation.

**[00:08:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Kwaki is also on the application to the Templeton Foundation and he is indeed a student of World Views.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, hello, Kwaki.

**[00:09:03] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning.

**[00:09:05] Coakee Wildcat**
> Good morning, everybody.

**[00:09:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Pierre, associated with Alex by this is my memory test, my mental status exam.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I've seen that you've done some interesting new work on 3d printed reefs and things like that.

**[00:09:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been following you on social media.

**[00:09:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm doing a quick round of presentations.

**[00:09:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that by let's say 907 Michael can begin his presentation.

**[00:09:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ali bin Shahid.

**[00:09:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think is also on the Bezos grant.

**[00:09:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's been doing an amazing round of publication and writing and on this unifying theme for our group, which is basically that we can heal the planet by restoring healthy ecosystems because the planet is a complex adaptive system with intelligence.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and many other properties which are usually ignored but not by Michael Levin who will be speaking soon.

**[00:10:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Samuel Ombeni joins us from Nakavali as does Colombo Imbilisi whose proposal we will be discussing a little bit later and Colombo I hope that you can walk us through your proposal.

**[00:10:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll notice in the agenda Samuel that we have a recommendation from the Steering Committee to help you cross your funding goal.

**[00:10:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So take a look at the agenda which is in the chat and you are on the agenda for a little bit later.

**[00:10:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we have Sean Patterson one of my earliest students at RIT Rochester Institute of Technology now an entrepreneur and working on recycled plastics as an alternative to cutting trees down.

**[00:11:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Alright, I suspect more people will be coming, but a brief introduction to Michael Levin.

**[00:11:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael is a professor at Harvard and Tufts, and he has been working in developmental biology, but also, I note, he's been reading the philosophy of mind and evolution and actually quotes William James, the American philosopher who I wrote several chapters about back in the day, and so he's doing cutting-edge mechanistic science at the same time as he's using 21st century philosophy of science and philosophy to try to expand the scope of the way we think about intelligence, mind, and coordination in nature.

**[00:11:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael can finish his self-introduction saying anything I should have said, and then he's going to give us a presentation.

**[00:12:00] Michael Levin**
> Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to share some thoughts with you.

**[00:12:05] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, my background originally is actually philosophy of mind and computer science.

**[00:12:10] Michael Levin**
> And I was interested in artificial intelligence and things like that.

**[00:12:12] Michael Levin**
> And then went on to do biology.

**[00:12:17] Michael Levin**
> what I'm going to talk about today is a case study in an emerging field called diverse intelligence.

**[00:12:25] Michael Levin**
> Now, I'm not going to talk about ecosystems at all.

**[00:12:28] Michael Levin**
> I know very little about ecosystems for what I am going to talk about are some conceptual tools that you might want to use in exploring this idea that ecosystems and similar kinds of complex systems have a degree of intelligence agency can be targets of communication of relationships and so on.

**[00:12:49] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to talk about a case study of a kind of a much of a much weirder system that in which we have been studying intelligence and I.

**[00:13:00] Michael Levin**
> think a lot of what we've been doing can carry over to what what you guys want to do.

**[00:13:04] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody's interested in all the primary papers, the data sets, the software, absolutely everything that I'm going to talk about is here at the site.

**[00:13:11] Michael Levin**
> And then here at this blog are kind of my own personal views on what some of it actually means.

**[00:13:17] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to try to make three main points today.

**[00:13:21] Michael Levin**
> First of all, we're going to look at the competencies of what I call an agential material.

**[00:13:26] Michael Levin**
> So living material is an agential material.

**[00:13:29] Michael Levin**
> has agendas, my ability to learn and so on.

**[00:13:32] Michael Levin**
> And this comes together into an unconventional mind using some of the same actually mechanisms that are studied by neuroscientists.

**[00:13:42] Michael Levin**
> We end up with beings that are that are very different from the typical brain, the animals in which behavior of science looks for for minds.

**[00:13:50] Michael Levin**
> We're going to talk about how to recognize intelligence and unfamiliar embodiments.

**[00:13:54] Michael Levin**
> I think that will be quite relevant to what you all want to do.

**[00:13:57] Michael Levin**
> And specifically, want to emphasize

**[00:14:00] Michael Levin**
> Just emergent complexity, emergent complexity is easy.

**[00:14:02] Michael Levin**
> I want to emphasize emergent cognition.

**[00:14:04] Michael Levin**
> And we could talk for many hours about that, but I just want to put it on the table.

**[00:14:09] Michael Levin**
> I will also talk about bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive glue, because I think that you will need to identify your cognitive glue in the emergent agents that might exist in the ecosystem.

**[00:14:22] Michael Levin**
> So this is something that part of the research program that you need to find.

**[00:14:26] Michael Levin**
> And this cognitive glue helps deal with the scaling problem of the emergence of larger minds from components.

**[00:14:33] Michael Levin**
> And I will talk about that.

**[00:14:35] Michael Levin**
> And then at the end, we'll just talk about some ethics of diverse intelligence and what this means for, what some of these ideas mean for ethics.

**[00:14:46] Michael Levin**
> So the bottom line to all of this is that I think that we are fundamentally not good at recognizing intelligence beyond familiar scales and familiar problem spaces.

**[00:14:57] Michael Levin**
> And we have to develop conceptual and practical tools.

**[00:15:00] Michael Levin**
> to find, not assume, but find and test the existence of minds within our midst, and then to work out the ethical and effective policies by which we can relate to them.

**[00:15:12] Michael Levin**
> So, this is, I'll boil down my whole philosophical approach in just three points.

**[00:15:19] Michael Levin**
> I think that we, that both ends of the spectrum, which have been strongly supported by various communities, are wrong.

**[00:15:28] Michael Levin**
> We can neither accept the mechanistic worldview, which says that there is mind either nowhere or only in a familiar brain, higher animals, nor a kind of animism which assumes that mind is everywhere and that there's the spirit under every rock.

**[00:15:43] Michael Levin**
> I think each one of these is limited and what we actually have to do is step away from these as assumptions, but instead develop frameworks that allow us to do experiments and actually see what level of agency is appropriate in different unconventional embodiments.

**[00:15:58] Michael Levin**
> I also think that this can.

**[00:16:00] Michael Levin**
> be detected via observational data alone, you have to do perturbative experiments on the system to interact with it and test your hypotheses about what kind of mind you're dealing with.

**[00:16:11] Michael Levin**
> You cannot do this just from observing, passively observing behavioral, behavioral data.

**[00:16:18] Michael Levin**
> And also diverse intelligence research is opening a much wider and stranger world than for example some of the arguments about plant cognition and things like that.

**[00:16:28] Michael Levin**
> It actually gets much weirder than that.

**[00:16:31] Michael Levin**
> So let's begin.

**[00:16:34] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing I want to do is help us break out of this kind of thinking.

**[00:16:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is an old painting of Adam naming the animals in the Garden of Eden.

**[00:16:47] Michael Levin**
> So there are a couple of things going on here.

**[00:16:49] Michael Levin**
> So the part that is wrong here and that we're going to have to radically alter is the idea that there are very specific and discrete natural kinds.

**[00:16:59] Michael Levin**
> we know where

**[00:17:00] Michael Levin**
> all the animals are here.

**[00:17:01] Michael Levin**
> There are specific types, as we might now say, species of animals.

**[00:17:05] Michael Levin**
> Adam is distinct from them, but again, he's a discrete type, and we know where to draw the boundaries, and we know where everything is here.

**[00:17:15] Michael Levin**
> We know where all the minds are here.

**[00:17:16] Michael Levin**
> So that is the story that we're going to have to really change.

**[00:17:19] Michael Levin**
> The part of this story that's I think profoundly true is interesting.

**[00:17:24] Michael Levin**
> If you ask why was it up to Adam to name the animals?

**[00:17:28] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't God do it?

**[00:17:29] Michael Levin**
> Why didn't the angels do it in this biblical story?

**[00:17:32] Michael Levin**
> Why did Adam have to name the animals?

**[00:17:34] Michael Levin**
> I think there are two interesting things here.

**[00:17:36] Michael Levin**
> One is that he's the one that's going to have to live with them.

**[00:17:39] Michael Levin**
> More specifically, those kind of traditions, naming something means that you've discovered the deep nature of it.

**[00:17:48] Michael Levin**
> When you know the name of something, that means that you've discovered its fundamental truth of whatever that is.

**[00:17:56] Michael Levin**
> I think what's interesting about this is that we are going to have

**[00:18:00] Michael Levin**
> to name in this sense, in the sense of deeply understanding a wide variety of creatures, novel creatures that we've never thought about before.

**[00:18:09] Michael Levin**
> so that part we should stick with.

**[00:18:13] Michael Levin**
> the thing about having these discrete kinds, it's really important to understand that we are at the center of a continuum.

**[00:18:20] Michael Levin**
> So on an evolutionary time scale, we were all unicellular organisms at one point in molecular cycles before that.

**[00:18:27] Michael Levin**
> On a developmental time scale, same thing, we all start life as a single cell and eventually become this.

**[00:18:33] Michael Levin**
> a lot of philosophy that goes on about the human minds and humans do this and humans do that.

**[00:18:39] Michael Levin**
> The question is, well, where does this sort of magical agential glow kind of peter out?

**[00:18:45] Michael Levin**
> The things that you want to say about a human in terms of capacities, rights, responsibilities, all that good stuff, how far back here would you like to extend that in what way?

**[00:18:54] Michael Levin**
> How far back here would you like to extend it?

**[00:18:56] Michael Levin**
> This is now both evolutionary biology and developmental biology.

**[00:19:00] Michael Levin**
> If you take them seriously, tell you that this is not a sharp to street natural kind, but all of these are very slow gradual process by which piece by piece you arrive at something like this, but you need a story of the scaling.

**[00:19:12] Michael Levin**
> How did you get from here to here.

**[00:19:14] Michael Levin**
> in fact that continuum that that that idea that you can't draw a sharp line actually gets much worse now because with bioengineering and with a better understanding of the interoperability of biology.

**[00:19:25] Michael Levin**
> We now see that there's another continuum here where both with technological extensions that begin with canes and glasses and things like that and end with more more significant body modifications.

**[00:19:39] Michael Levin**
> only are there technological changes and of course also biological changes that can be made.

**[00:19:45] Michael Levin**
> And again, if you're interested in a human, you better have some kind of story about what that means in terms of, you know, do you think it's a continuum where does it begin and end and what is really important about being a human when all of these kind of superficial.

**[00:20:00] Michael Levin**
> official details start to start to shift as they absolutely will, and you can, you know, anywhere along the levels of organization of our bodies, you can introduce, not just randomly evolved components, but actually design thoughtfully designed and engineered components.

**[00:20:16] Michael Levin**
> And you will have other kinds of beings.

**[00:20:19] Michael Levin**
> So we'll get to that.

**[00:20:20] Michael Levin**
> So I'm working on a framework.

**[00:20:22] Michael Levin**
> It's called TAME technological approach to mind everywhere.

**[00:20:26] Michael Levin**
> The goal of that framework is to be able to recognize, create, and ethically relate to really diverse intelligences.

**[00:20:33] Michael Levin**
> So that means not just the familiar kinds of animals and then maybe a whale and maybe an octopus and those kinds of things, but actually every kind of agent.

**[00:20:41] Michael Levin**
> So really unusual creatures, colonial organisms, swarms engineered new life forms, AI, whether purely software or robotic and someday maybe exobiological agents.

**[00:20:55] Michael Levin**
> so back, you know, as far as the 1940s it was already obvious from the from the cybernetics.

**[00:21:00] Michael Levin**
> kind of the beginnings of cybernetics.

**[00:21:04] Michael Levin**
> People had already tried to form a continuum like this.

**[00:21:08] Michael Levin**
> And so, yes, here, Rosenbluth-Wiener and Bigelow have this in terms of transitions, right?

**[00:21:14] Michael Levin**
> But the idea was that you can get, by telling a story of what's happening here, you can get from passive matter all the way up to slowly different kinds of agency and eventually to human level, you know, metacognition and so on.

**[00:21:28] Michael Levin**
> And so for this framework, requirements are that it is not purely philosophy.

**[00:21:35] Michael Levin**
> It has to be experimentally valuable.

**[00:21:38] Michael Levin**
> It has to move discovery forward.

**[00:21:40] Michael Levin**
> If it's not moving discovery forward, then we've not done our job.

**[00:21:43] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that, and as I'll show you some examples, both in terms of engineering and biomedicine, I think that having a facilitating conceptual perspective on these things leads you to new science.

**[00:21:56] Michael Levin**
> It's not just another way of thinking about things that might be fun or...

**[00:22:00] Michael Levin**
> or pleasant or whatever.

**[00:22:01] Michael Levin**
> It actually has very practical consequences.

**[00:22:03] Michael Levin**
> So in order to do that, I've tried to establish a continuum of different kinds of systems where the emphasis in the continuum is on kind of an engineering approach, which is the idea that any claim that you're going to make about systems, so for this group of claims that are made about ecosystems and so on, are really fundamentally interaction protocol claims.

**[00:22:28] Michael Levin**
> When you say that something, this system has this kind of a mind or is an agent or whatever, what you're really saying is here is my hypothesis about a set of tools that I can bring to bear in relating to that system.

**[00:22:41] Michael Levin**
> So you will have simple mechanical things where your only tools are hardware rewiring.

**[00:22:45] Michael Levin**
> You will have these kind of cybernetic agents like thermostats and various kinds of homeostats where you can actually change the set point, but you don't need to rewire the whole system.

**[00:22:54] Michael Levin**
> You're changing its goals and it has the beginnings of goal directiveness.

**[00:22:57] Michael Levin**
> Then you have more complex systems that have different kinds of learning.

**[00:23:00] Michael Levin**
> and are trainable by experiences.

**[00:23:02] Michael Levin**
> And there you don't directly interact with the memory media at all, but you provide rewards and punishments.

**[00:23:08] Michael Levin**
> And then you get to systems and whatever is beyond this that you can communicate with using fairly complex linguistic arguments and then the system does whatever it is.

**[00:23:19] Michael Levin**
> So again, this is a spectrum of persuadability because the idea is how do I get the system to do something different?

**[00:23:25] Michael Levin**
> Or at this point, how do I benefit from its agency and we have a two directional interaction and so on.

**[00:23:31] Michael Levin**
> And so the idea is that with all of these things, then these claims are not philosophical armchair of commitments, they are experimental hypotheses.

**[00:23:40] Michael Levin**
> And if you say that I think a system is at this level, well then that tells you here as a set of tools from rewiring cybernetics, behavioral science, psychoanalysis, whatever it's gonna be, here are the tools I plan to bring to it.

**[00:23:52] Michael Levin**
> Let's all see how that goes for me and then we compare.

**[00:23:55] Michael Levin**
> And so that means that any systems such as cellular collectives, for example, you can't just automatically

**[00:24:00] Michael Levin**
> assume that it's here the way molecular biology does and you can't just assume that it's somewhere out here the way some animist kinds of cultures do it, you have to do experiments, you have to make hypotheses and see what actually enables you to have a good interaction with it.

**[00:24:18] Michael Levin**
> I like to exercise these kinds of things in the area of developmental biology because in developmental biology you have a remarkable phenomenon.

**[00:24:28] Michael Levin**
> You can see right in front of your eyes, in the case of for example frog embryos, right in front of your eyes you can see this transition from matter to mind.

**[00:24:35] Michael Levin**
> That is you start life as a little blob of of biochemicals, it's a little quiescent oocyte and then slowly but surely you get to something like this and it's a slow gradual process.

**[00:24:46] Michael Levin**
> Developmental biology gives you no place to draw a sharp line that says okay before that you were a chemical physical system but now bang now you're a magical mind, there is no no such sharp distinction and so you go from here to here and what we owe is a story of the scale.

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> scaling?

**[00:25:00] Michael Levin**
> What is it that happened that scaled up the competencies of this and make no mistake cells have all kinds of competencies but into the competencies of things like that?

**[00:25:09] Michael Levin**
> So this a lot of people find is actually disturbing to be reminded that they're basically a bag of cells and that they can't that they developed from a single cell without some sort of magic in between.

**[00:25:21] Michael Levin**
> But at least they think well at least but at least I'm a unified intelligence you know I've got a real brain I'm not like an ant colony or a beehive that you know people say they're collective intelligence but that's that's just a metaphorical way of speaking I'm an actual intelligence right?

**[00:25:35] Michael Levin**
> Well the thing is with that is the thing with that is that we are all collective intelligences.

**[00:25:42] Michael Levin**
> So for example here's here's Renee Descartes he loved this idea of the pineal gland because there's only one of them in the brain and he felt that the unified human experience was well-served by having one discrete organ in the brain that underlies that ability but of course if he had had good microscopy he would have looked

**[00:26:00] Michael Levin**
> he would have looked into the pineal gland and realized that wow there's not one of anything inside the pineal gland is all this stuff these are cells and inside of each one of those tiny cells is all this stuff so we are all in effect collective intelligence is in the story we need to tell us how you get from here to here okay this is what individual cells look like this is that this happens to be a free-living organism but nevertheless it's a single cell it's called a lacrimaria there is no brain there's no nervous system here it is going about its hunting for bacteria and other other food in this environment it has all kinds of competencies at its local level in space so metabolic transcriptional those kinds of things and what we have in our bodies is this amazing multi-scale competency architecture every level from molecular networks to the subcellular components to the network of cells tissues organs of course whole organisms and swarms and colonies all of them solve problems these are not just structural problems

**[00:27:00] Michael Levin**
> for levels, but in their specific spaces, each of these levels is competent to solve and navigate various kinds of spaces.

**[00:27:08] Michael Levin**
> We as humans are okay, we're not great, but we're okay at recognizing intelligent navigation of medium-sized objects, moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

**[00:27:21] Michael Levin**
> birds and other mammals and things like that, we can sort of, we understand how to test those for intelligence more or less.

**[00:27:27] Michael Levin**
> But there are these other spaces which are difficult for us to recognize.

**[00:27:34] Michael Levin**
> So there's the space of all possible gene expression states, space of possible physiological states, and possible anatomical outcomes.

**[00:27:42] Michael Levin**
> And this is the one we're going to talk about mostly today.

**[00:27:46] Michael Levin**
> all of these spaces, these kinds of systems, oops, there we go.

**[00:27:58] Michael Levin**
> These kinds of systems navigate.

**[00:28:00] Michael Levin**
> these spaces and we are not primed to notice this.

**[00:28:03] Michael Levin**
> for example, if we imagine if we had evolved with a sense of directly being able to feel our blood chemistry, the way that we can taste and so on, let's say 20 different parameters of our blood chemistry, I think we have no trouble realizing that we live in a high dimensional space where our liver and our kidneys are some kind of symbiote that traverses these spaces to help us survive.

**[00:28:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, we're just not good at noticing these and so once you open your mind to those possibilities, you can do experiments such as taking gene regulatory networks, not even cells, but just simple networks of chemicals that turn each other on or off and you can ask, well, if I try to treat this as a cognitive agent, for example, stimulate some of the nodes and look at readouts of other nodes, what you find is that actually you can, these kinds of networks have six different kinds of learning.

**[00:28:55] Michael Levin**
> They can do habituation association, associate of conditioning.

**[00:29:00] Michael Levin**
> and so on.

**[00:29:01] Michael Levin**
> And you wouldn't know that if you were to just look at it and say, well, this is a set of dumb chemicals.

**[00:29:06] Michael Levin**
> It's obviously not a cognitive system, but that's a very limiting view.

**[00:29:10] Michael Levin**
> If you actually do the experiments, find out that you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:14] Michael Levin**
> Even below the cell level, you already have baked in to the molecular structure of life.

**[00:29:19] Michael Levin**
> You already have learning capacity long before you even get to be a cell.

**[00:29:22] Michael Levin**
> And this has all kinds of biomedical implications about how we use drugs in terms of drug association and drug conditioning and things like that.

**[00:29:30] Michael Levin**
> Michael.

**[00:29:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah.

**[00:29:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sorry to interrupt, but this system is an intra-cellular system?

**[00:29:36] Michael Levin**
> This doesn't, it doesn't matter.

**[00:29:38] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this works in real life.

**[00:29:40] Michael Levin**
> It works within cells, but the phenomenon, you don't even need cells.

**[00:29:44] Michael Levin**
> You can do this in a completely cell-free system.

**[00:29:46] Michael Levin**
> The minimal network that does this has about four nodes.

**[00:29:50] Michael Levin**
> And so if you set things up correctly for interacting chemicals, you'd already do associative conditioning.

**[00:29:55] Michael Levin**
> It really doesn't take much.

**[00:29:57] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:29:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[00:29:59] Michael Levin**
> And so going to,

**[00:30:00] Michael Levin**
> beyond the single cell level.

**[00:30:02] Michael Levin**
> Let's look at what happens, because I think this is where things get really interesting at the multicellular level.

**[00:30:08] Michael Levin**
> So this is how we start life as a collection of embryonic lastemiers.

**[00:30:13] Michael Levin**
> This is a cross-section through an adult human.

**[00:30:16] Michael Levin**
> So look at the incredible complexity here, all the organs and the structures and everything else.

**[00:30:21] Michael Levin**
> Where does this come from?

**[00:30:22] Michael Levin**
> How do these cells know to build all of this?

**[00:30:25] Michael Levin**
> Now you might think, well, it's in the DNA.

**[00:30:26] Michael Levin**
> We have this genome.

**[00:30:28] Michael Levin**
> But in fact, now that we can read genomes and actually long before that, we knew that the genome doesn't actually specify any of this stuff.

**[00:30:35] Michael Levin**
> What the genome specifies directly is proteins.

**[00:30:38] Michael Levin**
> It specifies the tiny hardware that every cell gets to have.

**[00:30:42] Michael Levin**
> The genome doesn't actually say anything directly about how many limbs you're going to have or eyes or anything like that.

**[00:30:48] Michael Levin**
> Any more than the genome of the termite encodes the shape of the mound or the genome of the spider tells you exactly what the shape of the web is going to be.

**[00:30:57] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are the results of...

**[00:31:00] Michael Levin**
> the physiological software of life playing out on the genetically specified hardware.

**[00:31:05] Michael Levin**
> So now we need to know a few things.

**[00:31:07] Michael Levin**
> We need to know how do these cell groups know what to make?

**[00:31:10] Michael Levin**
> If it's not specified in genome and there's no map in the genome, how do they know what to make?

**[00:31:15] Michael Levin**
> How do they know when to stop?

**[00:31:16] Michael Levin**
> As engineers, we need to ask, how far can we push this?

**[00:31:20] Michael Levin**
> In other words, is this all that these cells can make or could they make something else?

**[00:31:23] Michael Levin**
> And if so, how do we get them to make something else?

**[00:31:26] Michael Levin**
> And so this is how I think about the future of our field.

**[00:31:30] Michael Levin**
> Is this kind of and this thing I call an anatomical compiler.

**[00:31:34] Michael Levin**
> So the idea here is that someday you will be able to sit in front of a system where you can draw the animal, plant, biobot, organ, whatever you want, draw, draw it however, however you want the anatomy to be, OK?

**[00:31:48] Michael Levin**
> And what the system should do if we knew what we were doing, what the system would do is it would compile this description into a set of stimuli that would be given to cells to get them to build exactly this.

**[00:31:58] Michael Levin**
> Now, the obvious biomedical.

**[00:32:00] Michael Levin**
> applications if we had this were that all of this stuff would go away.

**[00:32:03] Michael Levin**
> birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease, all of this would be a non-issue if we could tell cells what to build because you would then just have them build healthy organs.

**[00:32:14] Michael Levin**
> the conceptual thing that's important here is that this is not some kind of 3D printer.

**[00:32:19] Michael Levin**
> The idea here is not that you're going to take individual cells and place them where they go like Legos.

**[00:32:24] Michael Levin**
> You're not going to try to micromanage this.

**[00:32:25] Michael Levin**
> This is a communications device.

**[00:32:27] Michael Levin**
> This is a device to map your goals as the bioengineer or worker and regenerative medicine onto the goal of the cells so that they build exactly what you want them to build.

**[00:32:36] Michael Levin**
> It's an alignment or communications device which requires you to understand the system that you're communicating with.

**[00:32:43] Michael Levin**
> What is it capable of doing?

**[00:32:45] Michael Levin**
> where we stand today is that biology is very good at this kind of stuff, figuring out which molecules interact with which other molecules.

**[00:32:55] Michael Levin**
> We're still a really far away from any anatomical compilers to say somebody lost their limb.

**[00:33:00] Michael Levin**
> let's get it back.

**[00:33:01] Michael Levin**
> And why is that?

**[00:33:02] Michael Levin**
> I think it's because biomedicine has been largely stuck where computer science was in the 1940s and 50s.

**[00:33:10] Michael Levin**
> This is what computer programming looked like back then in order to get the system to do something you physically had to rewire it.

**[00:33:16] Michael Levin**
> You sit there pulling wires because you had to physically rewire it.

**[00:33:19] Michael Levin**
> And while we've been gaining a lot of understanding about the hardware, the wiring, we have not in biology done what computer science has done, which is to move forward to programming by experiences, by signals and stimuli to take advantage of the reprogrammability of the hardware.

**[00:33:36] Michael Levin**
> And I'm here to tell you that the biological hardware is even much more reprogrammable than this.

**[00:33:42] Michael Levin**
> It has additional levels that computer science hasn't even begun to scratch at.

**[00:33:47] Michael Levin**
> But all of this has not yet been exploited.

**[00:33:50] Michael Levin**
> So what's missing is an understanding of the pervasive intelligence in biology.

**[00:33:55] Michael Levin**
> And I don't mean that metaphorically, except in the sense that all we have in science are metaphors.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> some sense.

**[00:34:00] Michael Levin**
> Yes, it's a metaphor because that's what all of this is, including molecular pathways and these little things here that molecular biologists like, they're all metaphors.

**[00:34:09] Michael Levin**
> But I mean this completely seriously and as practical a way as molecular biologists talk about these pathways.

**[00:34:16] Michael Levin**
> So let's do a definition first.

**[00:34:19] Michael Levin**
> I like William James's definition of intelligence.

**[00:34:22] Michael Levin**
> It's the ability to reach the same goal by different means.

**[00:34:25] Michael Levin**
> And what that allows you to do is to again look at a spectrum and say, for example, if I have two magnets and I separate them by a piece of wood, one thing these magnets will never do because they're not smart enough is to go around and get together because that would require them to temporarily get further from their goal and they don't have that ability for delay gratification.

**[00:34:43] Michael Levin**
> Over here you've got Romeo and Juliet and they have some social barriers and physical barriers and they've got long-term planning and language and they have all different ways of navigating their space.

**[00:34:52] Michael Levin**
> And then in between you have cells and mazes and animals and self-driving vehicles and everything else.

**[00:34:57] Michael Levin**
> again, when I say intelligence, I mean and I'm not by the

**[00:35:00] Michael Levin**
> I'm not arguing that this captures everything of interest about intelligence, this does not capture play and those kinds of things.

**[00:35:06] Michael Levin**
> For the purposes of today, what I'm looking at is the ability to reach the same goal by different means when the circumstances demand that that kind of performance, it's a problem solving competency.

**[00:35:17] Michael Levin**
> And so now we can ask, okay, having had this definition, let's just, let's look, what kind of collective intelligence do cellular swarms deploy?

**[00:35:25] Michael Levin**
> So the first thing we know about development is that while it's incredibly robust, so the under almost all circumstances with the exception of rare birth defects, you start with the system and you end up with this, the species specific target morphology.

**[00:35:42] Michael Levin**
> But let's be clear that this, the increase in complexity is not why I'm calling it intelligence.

**[00:35:48] Michael Levin**
> What I mean by intelligence is not simply that this is a system that clockwork like rolls on and you get something complex from a simple starting position that is not what I'm saying.

**[00:35:57] Michael Levin**
> What we have here is something different, which is that

**[00:36:00] Michael Levin**
> If you were to actually split these early embryos into halves or thirds or quarters or whatever, you don't get half bodies, you get perfectly normal monosygotic twins, triplets and so on.

**[00:36:09] Michael Levin**
> That's because the system can do something quite clever.

**[00:36:12] Michael Levin**
> It doesn't just roll on to the same outcome, it can navigate that space towards its goal.

**[00:36:19] Michael Levin**
> So this is the ensemble of states corresponding to normal human anatomy.

**[00:36:23] Michael Levin**
> It can get there in different paths depending on different starting positions.

**[00:36:27] Michael Levin**
> Here I am a whole embryo, here I'm a half embryo.

**[00:36:29] Michael Levin**
> This is the beginning of being able to navigate your space in a way that adapts to initial circumstances and you get your goal met despite something pretty horrible that happened to you, pretty disruptive.

**[00:36:39] Michael Levin**
> And this is how these twins are naturally born.

**[00:36:43] Michael Levin**
> Now some animals can do this throughout their lifespan.

**[00:36:46] Michael Levin**
> So this is an axolotl, and these amphibians can regenerate lots of different organs, so limbs, eyes, jaws, ovaries, spinal cord, portions of the brain and heart.

**[00:36:56] Michael Levin**
> And if you amputate anywhere along this.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> this limb.

**[00:37:00] Michael Levin**
> mean, they bite each other's legs off all the time when they're housed together.

**[00:37:03] Michael Levin**
> And what naturally happens in these natural experiments is that the leg will regrow rapidly exactly what needs to be grown, right?

**[00:37:11] Michael Levin**
> So at any position, you can do this.

**[00:37:13] Michael Levin**
> And it stops when a perfect replica is produced.

**[00:37:17] Michael Levin**
> That's the most amazing part of all of this.

**[00:37:19] Michael Levin**
> What's remarkable is that it knows when to stop.

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> When does it stop?

**[00:37:22] Michael Levin**
> It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed.

**[00:37:26] Michael Levin**
> So you deviate it from its normal position in anatomical space.

**[00:37:29] Michael Levin**
> You're here.

**[00:37:30] Michael Levin**
> It immediately recognizes the delta.

**[00:37:32] Michael Levin**
> It starts to reduce that error.

**[00:37:34] Michael Levin**
> So you've got an error minimization scheme.

**[00:37:35] Michael Levin**
> And then when the error gets to be low acceptable levels, then it stops.

**[00:37:39] Michael Levin**
> That is a goal directed process, aka anatomical.

**[00:37:43] Michael Levin**
> And this is how you recognize goals.

**[00:37:46] Michael Levin**
> So I said at the beginning that you can't just see intelligence by observation because if you were just to look at this, this just repeatedly again and again over, you know, billions of examples, all this looks like is

**[00:38:00] Michael Levin**
> its emergent complexity.

**[00:38:01] Michael Levin**
> It looks like a simple system that will do exactly the same thing and give you a complex outcome.

**[00:38:05] Michael Levin**
> That's not intelligence.

**[00:38:06] Michael Levin**
> And you don't know what's happening here until you do this.

**[00:38:09] Michael Levin**
> This is the perturbative experiment where you realize, oh wait, the system isn't just rolling forward into the same path.

**[00:38:15] Michael Levin**
> And that's what happens here.

**[00:38:16] Michael Levin**
> You realize that you didn't just make a salamander limb, but this is actually the goal.

**[00:38:21] Michael Levin**
> Staying in this anatomical space is actually the set point of the system and it will work really hard to maintain it and then it stops.

**[00:38:28] Michael Levin**
> By the way, this isn't just for salamanders and some other worms that I'm about to show you.

**[00:38:33] Michael Levin**
> Human livers are highly regenerative.

**[00:38:36] Michael Levin**
> Deere are an adult mammal that regenerates these antlers.

**[00:38:39] Michael Levin**
> up to a centimeter and a half of new bone growth per day when they're regenerating and human children can regenerate their fingertips.

**[00:38:46] Michael Levin**
> so this is a pretty generic capability and this is a simple example of this that we discovered some years back is that if you have this tadpole, so this is a tadpole of the frog here, the eyes, the nostrils, the brain, the gut.

**[00:39:00] Michael Levin**
> you have these tadpoles they become frogs and in order to do that they have to rearrange their face so you might think from observation that this is a hard-wired process and this is what people thought that the genetics somehow specifies each organ to move in a particular direction and you get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog so we decided to do the experiment we made so called Picasso tadpoles where everything was mixed up so the eyes on the back of the head the mouth is off to the side everything's just a complete mess and what we found is that these animals still make pretty normal frogs why because all of this stuff will move in an unnatural paths to get to where it needs to go and then it stops this is not a hard-wired process this is an error minimization scheme and so what the genetics actually gives us is this remarkable problem solving system that can can get to where it needs to go despite pretty pretty drastically different things happening to it and I want to introduce here this idea of the cognitive blue because what what you have going on here is lots of cells the cells are doing various

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> things.

**[00:40:00] Michael Levin**
> the goal is not a specific paint by numbers.

**[00:40:05] Michael Levin**
> Here's where every cell goes.

**[00:40:07] Michael Levin**
> The goal is a large-scale anatomical state.

**[00:40:10] Michael Levin**
> So how is it that you get individual cells cooperating towards this goal?

**[00:40:14] Michael Levin**
> So that's the first question and the second question is where where's the information?

**[00:40:17] Michael Levin**
> I'll show you both of those things.

**[00:40:19] Michael Levin**
> we need to understand why are these cells cooperating on this journey?

**[00:40:24] Michael Levin**
> know they're all moving to the same region of anatomical space.

**[00:40:26] Michael Levin**
> are they cooperating?

**[00:40:28] Michael Levin**
> And for that we need the concept of cognitive pool.

**[00:40:30] Michael Levin**
> So just imagine you've got this rat.

**[00:40:32] Michael Levin**
> You've trained him to press on a little petal and he gets a delicious pellet and that's his report.

**[00:40:37] Michael Levin**
> Now one interesting thing about this scenario is that there is no individual cell that has had both experiences.

**[00:40:44] Michael Levin**
> The cell at the bottom of the feet experiences the lever, the cells in the gut get the delicious sugar.

**[00:40:48] Michael Levin**
> No individual cell knows that those two things are linked.

**[00:40:51] Michael Levin**
> In order to know so who owns the associate of memory here.

**[00:40:55] Michael Levin**
> Well it's this it's this thing called the rat and what that is is a system that

**[00:41:00] Michael Levin**
> enables all of these cells to join together into a higher level cognitive intelligence that can store, that can own memories that none of its components own.

**[00:41:09] Michael Levin**
> So that's the definition of cognitive glue.

**[00:41:11] Michael Levin**
> It's a series of mechanisms in this case carried out by bio electricity of the neurons that allow the individual cells to be to store non-local memories that affect them all in specific ways that cannot be seen at the local level of individual cells.

**[00:41:25] Michael Levin**
> Okay, so the policies of cognitive glue is what we're looking for when we ask where does intelligence come from?

**[00:41:31] Michael Levin**
> Why is the intelligence of the rat different and likely bigger in some spaces than the intelligence of the individual cells?

**[00:41:38] Michael Levin**
> So the cognitive glue in this case as studied by neuroscientists on controversially is bio electricity.

**[00:41:45] Michael Levin**
> It's what makes you more than a pile of neurons in your brain.

**[00:41:48] Michael Levin**
> It's the electrical network.

**[00:41:50] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out that this kind of thing where in the brain, that amazing ability to solve problems and to achieve your behavioral goals,

**[00:42:00] Michael Levin**
> is implemented by electrical networks.

**[00:42:03] Michael Levin**
> You have little ion channels on your cell membrane that allow voltage to build up here, and that voltage may or may not propagate to its neighbors through these electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

**[00:42:13] Michael Levin**
> so that kind of network, that electrical network, that's the hardware.

**[00:42:16] Michael Levin**
> The software, which you can see here, this group did this visualization of electrical signaling in the living zebrafish brain.

**[00:42:23] Michael Levin**
> It's quite amazing.

**[00:42:25] Michael Levin**
> The commitment of neuroscience is that all of this animal's memories, its goals, its preferences, its behavioral repertoire, all of that is stored in this electrical activity.

**[00:42:36] Michael Levin**
> real-time electrical activity is the mind of the system.

**[00:42:40] Michael Levin**
> It's the collective intelligence of these cells.

**[00:42:42] Michael Levin**
> There millions of cells in the collective is held together by this electrophysiology.

**[00:42:46] Michael Levin**
> And then there's this project of neural decoding, where you can try to decode this.

**[00:42:54] Michael Levin**
> And if you understand the encoding, you can figure out what is this animal thinking about and what is it going to do next.

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> it turns

**[00:43:00] Michael Levin**
> And this is kind of a deep fundamental symmetry here is that actually this is way older than brains, all cells in your body have these ion channels, most of them have these electrical synapses to your neighbors, to their neighbors and the ability to form electrical networks is extremely ancient.

**[00:43:19] Michael Levin**
> It arose around the time of bacterial biofilms that is not some kind of innovation of brains for neurons.

**[00:43:24] Michael Levin**
> And what we've been studying for some years now is this idea that neuroscience is not about neurons at all.

**[00:43:30] Michael Levin**
> The whole fundamental insight of neuroscience and the idea that you can get higher level cognitive performance and and and inner perspective and so on.

**[00:43:40] Michael Levin**
> So all the way from the molecules of synapses synapses all the way up through whatever it is that psychoanalysis deals with all of those levels are implemented by this by this by electric.

**[00:43:52] Michael Levin**
> So we asked the same question before brains and muscles came on the scene to move you around through three dimensional space.

**[00:44:00] Michael Levin**
> What were these networks thinking about?

**[00:44:01] Michael Levin**
> These electrical networks that were present at the dawn of life and are present from the first cell division of your embryogenesis, what do these networks think about?

**[00:44:10] Michael Levin**
> Well, it turns out what they think about is configuring your body in anatomical space.

**[00:44:15] Michael Levin**
> And what evolution did was simply pivot those skills to three-dimensional space and eventually linguistic space.

**[00:44:20] Michael Levin**
> So we developed some of the first molecular tools to read and write this electrical information in non-neural cells.

**[00:44:28] Michael Levin**
> So this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:44:31] Michael Levin**
> You can see we use voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye.

**[00:44:34] Michael Levin**
> So this is not a simulation.

**[00:44:35] Michael Levin**
> This is real animal.

**[00:44:37] Michael Levin**
> You can see all voltage gradients as these cells figure out who's going to be anterior, who's going to be posterior, left, right, all of that.

**[00:44:46] Michael Levin**
> And then we do a lot of computer simulations to try to understand the change over time of these gradients, where do they come from, we try to simulate them during injury and during other processes.

**[00:44:58] Michael Levin**
> I want to show you what they look like.

**[00:45:01] Michael Levin**
> in organogenesis, this is an early frog embryo.

**[00:45:04] Michael Levin**
> Again, the brightness here is the voltage.

**[00:45:06] Michael Levin**
> And this is a time lapse of this early frog embryo putting its face together.

**[00:45:10] Michael Levin**
> And if you look at this one frame from that video, there's a lot going on, but if you look at this one frame, what you see is that long before the craniofacial organs actually appear, you can catch a memory.

**[00:45:21] Michael Levin**
> And I'm showing you this because this is the most obvious one and easy to decode some of the others we've seen are really, really complicated.

**[00:45:27] Michael Levin**
> But right here, you can already see this is where the animal's gonna put its right eye.

**[00:45:32] Michael Levin**
> This is where the mouth is going to go.

**[00:45:33] Michael Levin**
> There's some other placode structures that come out here.

**[00:45:36] Michael Levin**
> This is a pre-pattern that the cellular collective is driving in the physiology that ultimately directs the gene expression that you need to build these various organs.

**[00:45:49] Michael Levin**
> I'm gonna show you the functional aspect in a minute.

**[00:45:51] Michael Levin**
> But the idea is that what we're doing here when we do these bioelectrical imaging is basically the same thing you do in brain scans for neural decoding.

**[00:46:00] Michael Levin**
> is that you try to understand what is the collective thinking about quite literally what are the physiological data structures that are guiding future behavior but instead of muscle driven motility as you would study in rats or humans what you hear we're studying movement in anatomical space so this is a normal pattern that is required for normal craniofacial development here's a pathological pattern that is induced when we put a human oncogene into the embryo before they make a tumor you can already tell the cells have electrically disconnected from the rest of the tissue and they're going to roll back and become amoebas and metastasize they're going to treat the rest of body it's just external environment it's a it's a they disconnect from the electrical network that keeps them bound to of grandiose goals like building healthy organs and so on so that's the first thing we develop is these tools to listen in on that cognitive glue and I think for the for the whole ecosystem thing I think that's going to be really critical is to make hypotheses about what the cognitive glue is and then develop tools to eavesdrop

**[00:47:00] Michael Levin**
> on it and to try to decode it.

**[00:47:02] Michael Levin**
> And then we developed the other half of this, which is super important, which is the functional tools, because again, it's not enough to just record these patterns.

**[00:47:10] Michael Levin**
> mean, they look fun in a reading, until you can make changes, it doesn't prove anything.

**[00:47:14] Michael Levin**
> And so we develop tools to read and write that electrical information and we do not use, there are no electrodes, there are no waves, no frequencies, no magnets, no electromagnetic radiation.

**[00:47:26] Michael Levin**
> What we do here is we target the native interface that these cells are normally using to hack each other's behavior.

**[00:47:33] Michael Levin**
> The way they do that is through these ion channels on their membrane and these gap junctions that connect them to each other.

**[00:47:39] Michael Levin**
> And we now have the tools.

**[00:47:40] Michael Levin**
> this is both chemical, genetic, and optical light-based tools to open and close these channels, open and close these gap junctions and thus control which cells talk to which cells electrically and also control what are they saying.

**[00:47:55] Michael Levin**
> So now we can finally answer the question.

**[00:47:57] Michael Levin**
> Okay, these patterns, how do we know they're actually functional?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> How do they know?

**[00:48:00] Michael Levin**
> they actually determine anything as opposed to being an epiphenomenon of other stuff that happens.

**[00:48:05] Michael Levin**
> So now the experiment is, you change the bioelectrical state and you see what happens and it's not enough to just poison cells or kill them, you need to actually show how much specificity is there.

**[00:48:15] Michael Levin**
> If we're saying that that eye spot, I showed you here this little thing, if we're saying that this is why the eye forms here and not somewhere else, what happens if we move this?

**[00:48:24] Michael Levin**
> If we bioelectrically induce this pattern somewhere else and what happens is this, if we introduced that pattern elsewhere in the body, let's say on the gut, by injecting RNA and coding a specific potassium channel, these cells get a bioelectric pattern that is very similar to that eye spot I showed you and what that means to them, they interpret it, what it means to them is build an eye here and that is what they do.

**[00:48:49] Michael Levin**
> Those eyes, if you section them, they have the lens, retina, optic nerve, they have all the normal stuff.

**[00:48:54] Michael Levin**
> So from this, we learn three things.

**[00:48:56] Michael Levin**
> First of all, the bioelectric pattern is absolutely instructive.

**[00:48:59] Michael Levin**
> If you use those same

**[00:49:00] Michael Levin**
> signals elsewhere in the body.

**[00:49:01] Michael Levin**
> will make specific organs and I could show you lots of brains, hearts.

**[00:49:05] Michael Levin**
> I could show you lots of other organs.

**[00:49:06] Michael Levin**
> Second, it's modular.

**[00:49:08] Michael Levin**
> We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

**[00:49:11] Michael Levin**
> We didn't say anything about stem cells or gene expression.

**[00:49:13] Michael Levin**
> We spoke to them at a very high level.

**[00:49:16] Michael Levin**
> We said, build an eye here.

**[00:49:18] Michael Levin**
> That is a very high level subroutine call.

**[00:49:22] Michael Levin**
> We reset the path in anatomical space that they're going to take, but not by telling them exactly how to get here.

**[00:49:28] Michael Levin**
> This is not micromanagement.

**[00:49:30] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the genes.

**[00:49:31] Michael Levin**
> We are not talking to the cells.

**[00:49:33] Michael Levin**
> We are talking to the cellular collective and referring to specific locations in anatomical space.

**[00:49:39] Michael Levin**
> So this is the difference between talking to the ecosystem and talking to individual animals or plants within that ecosystem.

**[00:49:45] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk later.

**[00:49:46] Michael Levin**
> We actually had a project about talking to ant colons, not to the individual ants, but the ant colony itself.

**[00:49:52] Michael Levin**
> And we can talk about how you might do that.

**[00:49:55] Michael Levin**
> Okay, the other thing that's really interesting about this is that if we...

**[00:50:00] Michael Levin**
> So this is a cross-section through a lens sitting out in the tail somewhere that we induce.

**[00:50:05] Michael Levin**
> These blue cells are the ones that we actually bi-electrically modified, but the whole lens is made up of a bunch of native cells that were never directly touched by us, and that's because there's not enough of these guys, and so what do they do?

**[00:50:19] Michael Levin**
> They believe they should be making an eye, but part of that is they recruit the rest of these cells, they get their help to say, well, there's not enough of us, let's you guys need to help us and we'll build an eye.

**[00:50:31] Michael Levin**
> All of that is baked in, we didn't tell them how to do that, we didn't have to engineer that, that is automatic.

**[00:50:36] Michael Levin**
> There are of course other collective intelligences that do this, such as ants, right, that recruit their nest mates to help them move heavy objects and so on.

**[00:50:43] Michael Levin**
> So this is all part of being part of an agential material that not only can understand very high level cues, not just micromanage their gene expression, but actually things like build an eye, but also they have internal competencies about solving problems by adjusting to things like the number of

**[00:51:00] Michael Levin**
> participants and so on.

**[00:51:01] Michael Levin**
> So of course we've been we've been exploiting this in a regenerative medicine program so unlike salamanders frogs do not normally regenerate their legs we would like to enable humans to regenerate their organs and so we've developed a a bioelectric intervention that controls the cells at the at the wound site and tells them to head down the leg building path instead of the scarring path and so so here it is if you do this by 45 days there's already some toes there's a toenail there's a pretty good leg forming eventually it's quite quite a respectable leg and the important thing about this is that in the um and here the leg is touch sensitive and motile if you touch it they can certainly feel it and swim away with it uh the uh the the the treatment lasts one day 24 hours in adult frogs the the the growth of the actual leg takes a year and a half during that year and a half we don't touch them at all this is not about scaffolding this is not about 3d printing this is not about uh telling the the thing how to build the leg this is about

**[00:52:00] Michael Levin**
> Convincing it on day one that it should build a leg as opposed to scar over and after that you leave it alone And that's that's a big message here is that when you're dealing with agential materials one of the things that you gain is the ability to communicate at a high level that Enables you to get outcomes that you couldn't possibly micromanage their two to two complex and so Understanding this is the key.

**[00:52:21] Michael Levin**
> And so now of course, we're we're trying for for mammals and eventually hopefully clinical use And I have to do a disclosure here because Dave Kaplan and I have this company more for pseudocals Where we are trying to develop this technology for for humans okay, and The the next quick story that I'm going to tell you has to do with plenaria flatworms because this gets back to this idea of genetics and genomes and and so on this is this is a Very interesting a free-living animal.

**[00:52:51] Michael Levin**
> It has a true brain a true central nervous system.

**[00:52:53] Michael Levin**
> It is similar to our direct ancestors This is not like a flatworm or something and they have a couple of really interesting teachers that are instructive for us

**[00:53:00] Michael Levin**
> One is that they are incredibly regenerative, so you can cut them into pieces.

**[00:53:04] Michael Levin**
> The record is I think 276 pieces or something like that.

**[00:53:08] Michael Levin**
> Every piece will regrow a perfect little worm, but also they are extremely resistant to cancer, so they do not get cancer.

**[00:53:17] Michael Levin**
> They are immortal.

**[00:53:18] Michael Levin**
> They literally, the asexual strains here do not age.

**[00:53:22] Michael Levin**
> There's no such thing as an old plenarium of this type.

**[00:53:25] Michael Levin**
> They've been around for 400 million years.

**[00:53:27] Michael Levin**
> These are them.

**[00:53:28] Michael Levin**
> They do not age and die.

**[00:53:30] Michael Levin**
> They have an incredibly noisy genome for reasons that we can discuss afterwards.

**[00:53:37] Michael Levin**
> Isn't it amazing if you've taken biology, you'll note that in no class did they predict that the animal with the most regenerative capacity, resistance to cancer and immortality, is going to have the messiest genome around.

**[00:53:54] Michael Levin**
> It's supposed to be the other way around.

**[00:53:55] Michael Levin**
> If you want these things, the conventional story is that, well, you better be extremely protected.

**[00:54:00] Michael Levin**
> of your DNA, and this goes in exactly the opposite direction, and no one ever talks about it.

**[00:54:04] Michael Levin**
> And so again, if people have questions, I can talk about why that's the case.

**[00:54:08] Michael Levin**
> But one of the things that we did ask was a kind of a wacky question, which is, okay, once you have this little piece, how do you know how many heads you're supposed to have?

**[00:54:19] Michael Levin**
> Now you have a genome, but the genome doesn't specify the number of heads.

**[00:54:22] Michael Levin**
> The genome specifies a bunch of proteins.

**[00:54:24] Michael Levin**
> So the question is, okay, how do you know how many heads this little piece is supposed to have?

**[00:54:28] Michael Levin**
> And it turns out that there's a bioelectrical gradient, which you can image here, and the gradient says one head.

**[00:54:34] Michael Levin**
> That's how many heads you're supposed to have.

**[00:54:35] Michael Levin**
> So what you can do is you can take this animal and actually change the voltage pattern.

**[00:54:39] Michael Levin**
> You can say, no, you should have two heads.

**[00:54:40] Michael Levin**
> You can see that this is a lot messier than this, and that's because the technology is still being worked out.

**[00:54:44] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is quite clear, you can establish a pattern that says two heads.

**[00:54:48] Michael Levin**
> And if you cut this animal, sure enough, boom, this is what you get.

**[00:54:51] Michael Levin**
> This is not AI or Photoshop.

**[00:54:53] Michael Levin**
> These are real animals.

**[00:54:55] Michael Levin**
> Also, notice that this bioelectrical map is not a map of this two-headed animal.

**[00:55:00] Michael Levin**
> This is a map of this perfectly anatomically and molecularly normal animal, but it's memory of what to do if I get injured in the future is now been altered This is what this animal remembers as the correct planarian, but nothing happens until it gets injured So in a certain sense, this is a counterfactual memory This is not a representation of happening to this what's happening to this body right now This is a memory of what I'm going to do if I get injured in the future So I think that you know, we talk about a mental time travel and this idea that brainy animals Have this this ability to Remember things and predict things that are not true right now.

**[00:55:37] Michael Levin**
> Well, this is where it comes from You do you this is this is the an extremely ancient ability of bioelectrical networks to Have to to store memories that are not true right now and so the memory of this anatomical This collective intelligence in the anatomical space says two heads and when you cut it, that's what it does now the next amazing.

**[00:55:58] Michael Levin**
> Yep

**[00:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> may have interrupt, but I have prerogative here.

**[00:56:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Are you saying that you treat the bio electric, you create those that edited bio electric pattern on the full planarian before you cut out the middle third?

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> can do that.

**[00:56:16] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:17] Michael Levin**
> So it's a little it's a little more complicated than that, but but the bottom line is yes, that's that's correct.

**[00:56:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, this is this is this is what you see in an intact animal.

**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And yet the middle third has somehow encoded the pattern.

**[00:56:31] Michael Levin**
> All of the cells are using this as the as the tar as the set point of their anatomical homeostasis.

**[00:56:36] Michael Levin**
> This is this is their only now.

**[00:56:39] Michael Levin**
> I mean, this is the this is the gold standard of what do we do when we get injured.

**[00:56:44] Michael Levin**
> And once you change that, there's nothing else for them to compare it to and they build whatever it says that this is this is their set point.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yeah.

**[00:56:50] Michael Levin**
> Yep.

**[00:56:51] Michael Levin**
> And so what's what's more important, even than that is the idea that, you know, I keep calling it a memory.

**[00:56:57] Michael Levin**
> Why?

**[00:56:58] Michael Levin**
> Because if you take these two headed animals and you could

**[00:57:00] Michael Levin**
> continuously cut them in plain water.

**[00:57:01] Michael Levin**
> No more manipulation of any kind.

**[00:57:03] Michael Levin**
> They remain two-headed.

**[00:57:05] Michael Levin**
> Every piece of every middle piece here is going to continue to grow two heads.

**[00:57:09] Michael Levin**
> Now there's nothing wrong with their genomes.

**[00:57:11] Michael Levin**
> We have not touched their genomes, we have not edited their genomes.

**[00:57:14] Michael Levin**
> If we were to, we're not going to do this, but if you were to throw these, you know, in the Charles River here in Boston, some scientists would come along, you know, 10 years later, they would scoop up some samples, they would see some one-headed worms and some two-headed worms, they would say, oh, cool, a speciation event.

**[00:57:27] Michael Levin**
> Let's, let's sequence the genomes and see, see what drove it, right?

**[00:57:31] Michael Levin**
> And the genomes are exactly identical.

**[00:57:32] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing wrong with them.

**[00:57:33] Michael Levin**
> So, so the question of how does the planarian know how many heads it should have, this subtle?

**[00:57:38] Michael Levin**
> In a certain sense, it's DNA because the DNA encodes hardware that by default says one head, but it's also, in another sense, it's absolutely not the DNA because it's reprogrammable.

**[00:57:54] Michael Levin**
> It's you can see these two-headed animals hanging around.

**[00:57:58] Michael Levin**
> Not only can you, not only can you

**[00:58:00] Michael Levin**
> change the number of heads, but actually you can change the species of head.

**[00:58:04] Michael Levin**
> So these are derocephalus.

**[00:58:07] Michael Levin**
> you amputate the head and perturb the bioelectrical signaling, you can get flat heads like a Pifelina.

**[00:58:12] Michael Levin**
> You can get round heads like an S-Mediterrania.

**[00:58:14] Michael Levin**
> Not only the head shape, but the distribution of stem cells and the brain shape becomes like these other species, what 100 to 150 million years distance between this guy and the shapes So in anatomical space, there are attractors corresponding to different head shapes, and there are species that naturally live in these attractors, but this hardware can be asked to visit these others because it is reprogrammable.

**[00:58:38] Michael Levin**
> It has no trouble visiting these other data structures and the cells will build what these guys naturally build.

**[00:58:45] Michael Levin**
> You can go further than this and you can ask, well, what are the attractors in that space?

**[00:58:49] Michael Levin**
> We have seen a plan area that we make that are these crazy spiky forms.

**[00:58:54] Michael Levin**
> We've seen these things that aren't even flat.

**[00:58:56] Michael Levin**
> They're sort of cylindrical combination forms.

**[00:58:59] Michael Levin**
> You don't have to even be

**[00:59:00] Michael Levin**
> be a typical flatworm and this ability to hack these cells and push them into novel regions of the anatomical space is not a unique ability to human bioengineers.

**[00:59:13] Michael Levin**
> Here's a gall formed on this oak leaf.

**[00:59:17] Michael Levin**
> Now, if it weren't for this non-human bioengineer, which is this little wasp, if it wasn't for that, we would have absolutely no idea that these flat green cells that normally make extremely reliably make these flat leaves that they were capable of being prompted to make something like this.

**[00:59:34] Michael Levin**
> This gall is made from the plant cells and it is not made from the by the wasp.

**[00:59:39] Michael Levin**
> The wasp drops off some chemicals that are kind of a biopromping exploitation of the competencies of these cells where it convinces them to build something like this.

**[00:59:50] Michael Levin**
> We would have never known that.

**[00:59:52] Michael Levin**
> There's no indication that this is even possible until you see this.

**[00:59:54] Michael Levin**
> The exploration of this morphous space is really important to understand what the material is capable of.

**[01:00:00] Michael Levin**
> of what your agential material is capable of, which is part of understanding how to communicate to it.

**[01:00:05] Michael Levin**
> We are now, for that reason, we are using skin cells from frog embryos to understand the competencies of novel beings.

**[01:00:14] Michael Levin**
> Because typically, you would look at something like this and you would say, OK, where did all these shapes come from?

**[01:00:19] Michael Levin**
> Well, this comes from eons of selection to be a good planarian.

**[01:00:22] Michael Levin**
> This comes from eons of selection on both the plant and the wasp to be able to do this.

**[01:00:28] Michael Levin**
> So lots of evolution going on.

**[01:00:31] Michael Levin**
> OK, so we wanted to see if we could expand that paradigm.

**[01:00:36] Michael Levin**
> And what we did was liberate some skin cells from a frog embryo.

**[01:00:41] Michael Levin**
> skin cells, you see them here, here they are, they're dissociated.

**[01:00:47] Michael Levin**
> They're put in a little depression.

**[01:00:48] Michael Levin**
> They could have done many things.

**[01:00:49] Michael Levin**
> They could have died.

**[01:00:50] Michael Levin**
> They could have spread away from each other.

**[01:00:52] Michael Levin**
> They could have formed a flat monolayer.

**[01:00:55] Michael Levin**
> But instead, what they do is they form this little thing.

**[01:00:57] Michael Levin**
> We call it a xenobot.

**[01:00:59] Michael Levin**
> Xenobot because Xenopus later.

**[01:01:00] Michael Levin**
> this is the name of the frog and bot because we are trying to reprogram their form and function.

**[01:01:08] Michael Levin**
> What you see here is that, first of all, the little hairs that they normally use to distribute mucus down the body of the frog are in fact being used here to swim along.

**[01:01:19] Michael Levin**
> So they're coordinated to swim.

**[01:01:20] Michael Levin**
> They can go in circles like this.

**[01:01:22] Michael Levin**
> They can go back and forth like this.

**[01:01:23] Michael Levin**
> And remember, this is just skin.

**[01:01:25] Michael Levin**

**[01:01:27] Michael Levin**
> There is no neurons here.

**[01:01:28] Michael Levin**
> There's nothing else.

**[01:01:30] Michael Levin**
> They have collective behaviors.

**[01:01:32] Michael Levin**
> They can interact with each other.

**[01:01:33] Michael Levin**
> They can, you know, they can do these little dances.

**[01:01:38] Michael Levin**
> Here's a xenobot traversing a maze.

**[01:01:41] Michael Levin**
> So it floats down here.

**[01:01:42] Michael Levin**
> It's swimming along.

**[01:01:43] Michael Levin**
> It takes the corner without bumping into the opposite wall.

**[01:01:46] Michael Levin**
> And then at this point, something internal kicks in, it turns around and goes backward, came from.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> Okay.

**[01:01:50] Michael Levin**
> So it has a variety of novel behaviors.

**[01:01:54] Michael Levin**
> One amazing thing that they can do is if you provide them with loose skin cells, so this white stuff

**[01:02:00] Michael Levin**
> here are just the dissociated skin cells.

**[01:02:02] Michael Levin**
> happens is that they, by their motion, both collectively and individually, they collect them into little piles.

**[01:02:10] Michael Levin**
> And because they're working with an agential material themselves, just as we were when we made these bots, what they're doing is making the next generation of bots.

**[01:02:18] Michael Levin**
> And these guys, when they mature, guess what they do?

**[01:02:21] Michael Levin**
> They run around and they make the next generation and the next generation.

**[01:02:24] Michael Levin**
> This is called kinematic replication.

**[01:02:26] Michael Levin**
> As far as we know, no other creature on earth does this.

**[01:02:28] Michael Levin**
> This is completely novel.

**[01:02:30] Michael Levin**
> We did not teach them to do this.

**[01:02:31] Michael Levin**
> We did not have to force them to do this.

**[01:02:33] Michael Levin**
> This is something they discovered on their own because we made it impossible for them to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion.

**[01:02:39] Michael Levin**
> is an example of the amazing emergence of competencies that you would not predict from a pile of frog skin cells.

**[01:02:48] Michael Levin**
> So, and so I'm getting to the end of all this.

**[01:02:51] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is this, what did the frog genome actually learn?

**[01:02:56] Michael Levin**
> Well, over the years, yeah, I'd learned to do this, to produce.

**[01:03:00] Michael Levin**
> a very specific path of a sequence of organisms that are fit for specific froggy environments.

**[01:03:06] Michael Levin**
> But amazingly, it turns out that if you liberate these cells away from the rest of the cells that basically bully them into having this boring life as the two-dimensional outer skin of a tadpole, what you find out is what they're really capable of when left to their own devices.

**[01:03:22] Michael Levin**
> What they're capable of is making these xenobots.

**[01:03:24] Michael Levin**
> They do have a developmental sequence.

**[01:03:26] Michael Levin**
> This is an 84-day-old bot who knows what it's turning into.

**[01:03:29] Michael Levin**
> I have no idea.

**[01:03:31] Michael Levin**
> And they have these behaviors.

**[01:03:33] Michael Levin**
> The thing is they have no straightforward evolutionary backstory.

**[01:03:36] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any xenobots.

**[01:03:37] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.

**[01:03:40] Michael Levin**
> There's never been any kinematic replication.

**[01:03:42] Michael Levin**
> All of this emerges spontaneously.

**[01:03:44] Michael Levin**

**[01:04:10] Michael Levin**
> But the bottom line is that we really have to understand our material.

**[01:04:13] Michael Levin**
> When we look out into the biosphere, it is not just the set of things that we know exist, it is all the other aspects of one way to think about this, and we don't have a great way of thinking about this, and I'll be completely transparent here, is that this is not how most of my molecular biology colleagues think about this, but I actually think these kinds of constructs raise a very crisp question about where do these other forms and functions come from.

**[01:04:44] Michael Levin**
> I think there's an enormous but well-structured latent space of possibilities, one way to think about it is a platonic space of affordances, and that what we are doing by creating, when we create biobots, when other beings

**[01:05:00] Michael Levin**
> hack each other when AI, we have some projects on this where we're using AI tools to create some of these things.

**[01:05:07] Michael Levin**
> In all of these cases, what we're making are vehicles for exploring this latent space, whereas each normal embryo and adult are one point of that space, and normally that's all we ever get to see.

**[01:05:18] Michael Levin**
> By using these things, have a kind of exploration vehicle or a little periscope that you get to poke out of the normal bounds of what we see and explore the adjacent and actually maybe quite far distal structures in that space and what else is possible.

**[01:05:35] Michael Levin**
> so this is really, I think, what may be relevant to all of you is that Darwin had this phrase, this endless forms most beautiful, and he was very impressed with the variety of life that's out there.

**[01:05:49] Michael Levin**
> what I want to point out is that everything that you've ever seen or heard of in the biosphere is a tiny corner of this space of possible bodies and minds because, and again, for

**[01:06:00] Michael Levin**
> We can talk about life is incredibly interoperable and pretty much any combination of evolved material, engineered material and software is some kind of possible embodied mind.

**[01:06:11] Michael Levin**
> We're talking about cyborgs, hybrids, chimeras of various types.

**[01:06:15] Michael Levin**
> We make frog allotls in our lab, which is sort of part axolotl.

**[01:06:19] Michael Levin**
> All of these things are possible.

**[01:06:21] Michael Levin**
> I do think it's true that in the future, the next generation is going to be living in a world surrounded by beings that basically completely break all of the old categories about organisms, machines, robots, living beings.

**[01:06:37] Michael Levin**
> All of these are binary categories that are going to be broken down by the appearance of all kinds of novel beings that we are going to have to relate to.

**[01:06:47] Michael Levin**
> But I also think the point isn't that we need to make all of these things.

**[01:06:51] Michael Levin**
> The point is that by thinking about the space of possible beings and what their properties are like and how bad we are at understanding the emergent minds and the content of those minds.

**[01:07:00] Michael Levin**
> helps us to recognize novel beings that are already here.

**[01:07:04] Michael Levin**
> is not just about making a bunch of weird new creatures.

**[01:07:06] Michael Levin**
> This is about saying that diverse intelligence research is about asking how do we recognize and relate to minds and unconventional embodiments.

**[01:07:14] Michael Levin**
> patterns in large scale ecosystems, tiny scale molecular networks, we're just terrible.

**[01:07:21] Michael Levin**
> People are natural, very skeptical about memory and learning and molecular networks in ecosystems.

**[01:07:26] Michael Levin**
> They like a particular scale to roughly the size of a few meters, that's great.

**[01:07:31] Michael Levin**
> And if you can deploy that behavior on the scale of milliseconds to hours, that's fantastic.

**[01:07:37] Michael Levin**
> But if you're much faster or much slower than that, it's really rough for people to catch on.

**[01:07:42] Michael Levin**
> So this is what the field of diverse intelligence is trying to do is to develop tools and frameworks for what I call an ethical synthbiosis.

**[01:07:54] Michael Levin**
> And this word actually was invented for me by GPT-4.

**[01:07:58] Michael Levin**
> I was looking for...

**[01:08:00] Michael Levin**
> something to capture this idea that we want to be in a mutually positive symbiotic relationship, but with things that are not just the product of random evolution, but actually also are part of the expanded biosphere that is going to be here.

**[01:08:13] Michael Levin**
> And so the last thing I wanna talk about is to get even just one step weirder.

**[01:08:20] Michael Levin**
> Hopefully this audience will enjoy it.

**[01:08:23] Michael Levin**
> The thing about this, if you look at all of these things, they're all pretty weird, you know, all these hybrids and cyborgs and everything else, they're strange, but the one thing they all have in common is that they have conventional embodiment in the sense that, yeah, they may navigate some other spaces like physiological space or whatever, fundamentally they're all objects, so to speak.

**[01:08:44] Michael Levin**
> And so, right, they're all physical things and physical things, they're cognitive systems and they are thinkers in that sense.

**[01:08:54] Michael Levin**
> And then they have thoughts and these thoughts are patterns.

**[01:08:57] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of energy and information that go with through...

**[01:09:00] Michael Levin**
> the cognitive apparatus, the brains, or whatever else it is, all of these systems.

**[01:09:07] Michael Levin**
> Well, William James actually had a funny statement that he didn't really dig into it too much, but he had this funny statement that said, thoughts are thinkers.

**[01:09:17] Michael Levin**
> And I wanted to show you a simple example of where I think that goes.

**[01:09:22] Michael Levin**
> Just imagine, this is a science fiction story for a minute.

**[01:09:26] Michael Levin**
> And there's a whole, this thing at this link, you can kind of see the whole piece on this that I wrote that you can see.

**[01:09:32] Michael Levin**
> imagine something.

**[01:09:34] Michael Levin**
> Imagine these creatures come out of the center of the earth.

**[01:09:37] Michael Levin**
> They live somewhere near the core of the earth.

**[01:09:40] Michael Levin**
> They're incredibly dense, just incredibly dense.

**[01:09:43] Michael Levin**
> Their vision is gamma rays, what that means is this.

**[01:09:52] Michael Levin**
> When they come up here, they don't see anything around us.

**[01:09:56] Michael Levin**
> As far as they're concerned, there's a thin gas covering the planet.

**[01:09:59] Michael Levin**
> It's like a plasmode.

**[01:10:00] Michael Levin**
> very rarefied plasma.

**[01:10:01] Michael Levin**
> And everything that we consider as physical objects is our patterns within this gas.

**[01:10:08] Michael Levin**
> They're walking around and they're disturbing these busting holes through the buildings.

**[01:10:15] Michael Levin**
> And it's basically the way that we walk through clouds of chemicals through the ecosystem.

**[01:10:19] Michael Levin**
> And we don't even see it.

**[01:10:20] Michael Levin**
> They're patterns of information.

**[01:10:21] Michael Levin**
> They're not real, like us.

**[01:10:23] Michael Levin**
> And so in this piece, I have a little dialogue.

**[01:10:26] Michael Levin**
> One of them is a scientist, and he's scanning.

**[01:10:28] Michael Levin**
> He's got these tools and he's kind of scanning this stuff.

**[01:10:30] Michael Levin**
> He says, you know, I've been studying this gas and there are patterns moving around in this gas and they kind of look agentially.

**[01:10:37] Michael Levin**
> They almost look like they have behavior and they almost look like they have certain memories and they're trying to do something.

**[01:10:43] Michael Levin**
> And the others say, well, that's crazy.

**[01:10:44] Michael Levin**
> We're real organisms.

**[01:10:47] Michael Levin**
> We're solid.

**[01:10:48] Michael Levin**
> Patterns in gas can't be agents.

**[01:10:49] Michael Levin**
> What do you mean patterns?

**[01:10:51] Michael Levin**
> And by the way, how long do these patterns stick together?

**[01:10:54] Michael Levin**
> says, well, about 100 years.

**[01:10:55] Michael Levin**
> But that's crazy.

**[01:10:56] Michael Levin**
> Nothing interesting can happen in 100 years.

**[01:10:57] Michael Levin**
> That's too short.

**[01:10:58] Michael Levin**
> so what I think

**[01:11:00] Michael Levin**
> think this kind of intuition pump is telling you is that the distinction between real agents, thinkers and patterns of information within those agents, a.k.a.

**[01:11:13] Michael Levin**
> thoughts or patterns within an excitable medium is kind of in the eye of the beholder.

**[01:11:19] Michael Levin**
> This is not some fundamental objective distinction.

**[01:11:23] Michael Levin**
> So there's a whole and so I'm going to stop here in a minute because this would take hours, but this idea of agentic memory patterns.

**[01:11:32] Michael Levin**
> I mean, we are, after all, if you think about us, we are temporary physiological and metabolic dissipative systems.

**[01:11:38] Michael Levin**
> We hold together kind of like a hurricane or something like that for some amount of time and eventually that's it.

**[01:11:45] Michael Levin**
> So we really need to not only to be able to notice intelligence in the unusual objects around us, we really actually need to pay attention to things that don't look like thinkers to us at all, which is patterns in the.

**[01:12:00] Michael Levin**
> these systems.

**[01:12:01] Michael Levin**
> That's maybe if I didn't lose you on all the previous stuff, this is probably where most people decide to drop off.

**[01:12:09] Michael Levin**
> I really think that this is if we really want to understand what ecosystems are telling us, because I think that if some alien observers came down and they have a radically different time scale and size scale, and they start asking themselves, well, who do we want to talk to?

**[01:12:26] Michael Levin**
> The answer might be that they want to talk to the ecosystem, and we are a persistent, hard to get rid of memory pattern in that ecosystem that is kind of a almost like an intrusive thought, the way that some cognitive systems have these persistent, intrusive thoughts that aren't necessarily good for them, but they reinforce their own existence, and they're hard to get rid of.

**[01:12:50] Michael Levin**
> So here's where I'll end.

**[01:12:53] Michael Levin**
> What I tried to tell you today is this.

**[01:12:55] Michael Levin**
> I think that intelligence is potentially everywhere.

**[01:12:58] Michael Levin**
> You can't just assume it's there, you have to do it.

**[01:13:00] Michael Levin**
> experiments and learning to rise above our evolutionary firmware and recognize it in unfamiliar guises is pretty essential for not only biomedical progress for things like regenerative medicine, but also for the ethical flourishing of sentient beings all over the planet.

**[01:13:19] Michael Levin**
> The research agenda here are principal frameworks that avoid the teleophobia that's pervasive in the sciences and also an unquestioning idea that yes, we can just sort of assign high level minds to everything we see.

**[01:13:35] Michael Levin**
> We have to get it right, not skew low and not day dream high, but we have to get it right.

**[01:13:40] Michael Levin**
> And I think a lot of these binary categories that are with us from pre-scientific days do more harm than good and we can now start to test some of these ideas.

**[01:13:49] Michael Levin**
> And in the future, we are going to have models that talk about a continuum of agency, observer relative models, and there's a whole thing.

**[01:14:00] Michael Levin**
> We could talk about about AI tools as universal translators.

**[01:14:03] Michael Levin**
> So if anybody wants to dig into any of this stuff, there are some papers here, and I'll make the slides available later so you can see all this stuff, but there's a bunch of papers here.

**[01:14:10] Michael Levin**
> I mean, I just wanna thank the people who did the work.

**[01:14:13] Michael Levin**
> So Doug Blackiston did all the Xenobot biology and Shariao did the eye experiments.

**[01:14:18] Michael Levin**
> And the planaria work I showed you was Fallon Durant.

**[01:14:23] Michael Levin**
> And here are some of my close collaborators and the funders that have supported this work.

**[01:14:29] Michael Levin**
> Jeremy Gay drew some of the beautiful illustrations and again, disclosures.

**[01:14:33] Michael Levin**
> These are two companies that support this work.

**[01:14:37] Michael Levin**
> So I thank you.

**[01:14:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:14:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:14:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could- Thank you.

**[01:14:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could talk about this for a long time, but first I wanna see, are you able to stick around for a little while and discuss with us?

**[01:14:53] Michael Levin**
> I have a few minutes.

**[01:14:55] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, I'm late to my next thing, but they can wait a little bit.

**[01:14:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:15:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm loaded with questions.

**[01:15:06] Alex Bal**
> Alex.

**[01:15:07] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, loaded with questions and there's not time for it.

**[01:15:09] Alex Bal**
> But just a couple of question related to, I said, I'm doing a deep dive in biology.

**[01:15:15] Alex Bal**
> I'm an information and communication scientist, and I'm really focused on the senses as a mode of communication that is universal.

**[01:15:21] Alex Bal**
> So that's what takes me into biology.

**[01:15:23] Alex Bal**
> In Europe, you have Andreas Wagner, who is out of Zurich, talking about universal libraries, these invisible universal libraries that organism tough into.

**[01:15:34] Alex Bal**
> And as you were presenting this, I mean, I looked at your presentation beforehand, I can't help but wonder, that these libraries where that bioelectricity gets the solutions to problems from, right, according to Wagner, and also according to people out of Oxford, cells are problem solving all the time, and they are accessing these universal, somehow cognitive spaces where some decisions are being made.

**[01:16:02] Michael Levin**
> I think that's exactly right.

**[01:16:05] Michael Levin**
> think Andreas is one of the, I love his work.

**[01:16:07] Michael Levin**
> I think he's one of the only people that's talking about this in the correct fashion.

**[01:16:12] Michael Levin**
> I will make one step, I go slightly further than him in the following idea.

**[01:16:18] Michael Levin**
> Library sort of implies that these are passive structures and what the biologist, right?

**[01:16:24] Michael Levin**
> so I think that not only the living physical machines are active in picking out and going through these libraries, but the data structures in the library itself have an active chemistry with all of their own, right?

**[01:16:40] Alex Bal**
> And then from what they explain is they exist in quantum dimensions.

**[01:16:45] Alex Bal**
> So there are multitudes of dimensions that they don't have everything we saw.

**[01:16:48] Alex Bal**
> But they can access these things.

**[01:16:50] Alex Bal**
> mean, they can actually get answers from these libraries, which is so mind blowing.

**[01:16:55] Alex Bal**
> mean, the world of biology today is incredibly fascinating because where are we going?

**[01:17:00] Alex Bal**
> So last question, are we machines ourselves?

**[01:17:03] Alex Bal**
> Are we technologies of the natural world?

**[01:17:06] Michael Levin**
> so if you send me an email, I'll send you a copy of this.

**[01:17:10] Michael Levin**
> I just wrote something about it, the whole idea of the machine metaphor is really, people are really, when they talk about machines and when they get all worked up about comparing living things to machines, they're imagining some sort of 18th steam engine.

**[01:17:27] Michael Levin**
> This is not what machines are.

**[01:17:29] Michael Levin**
> And I think that a proper continuum of systems will tell you that, yes, from certain perspectives, your orthopedic surgeon better think of you as a mechanical machine, right?

**[01:17:43] Michael Levin**
> But if your psychotherapist thinks of you as a mechanical machine, that's a problem.

**[01:17:47] Michael Levin**
> So different, these framings have utility in different ways.

**[01:17:53] Michael Levin**
> And so yes, we are machines in the sense that there are rational methods to manipulating our form and

**[01:18:40] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:01] Michael Levin**

**[01:19:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:19:53] Michael Levin**

> And now you can ask some interesting questions about whether antherobots retain some of the behavioral properties of the donor.

**[01:20:26] Michael Levin**
> For example, we get tissue from smokers.

**[01:20:30] Michael Levin**
> so now you can ask a simple question, are the antherobots addicted to nicotine?

**[01:20:34] Michael Levin**
> You know, it's about a million questions.

**[01:20:35] Michael Levin**
> death is, yeah, I don't know.

**[01:20:38] Michael Levin**
> That doesn't answer your question at all, but it's definitely not necessarily what we think it is.

**[01:20:44] Michael Levin**
> Wonderful, thank you.

**[01:20:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks.

**[01:20:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, I'm gonna let you go ahead and mean.

**[01:20:49] Michael Levin**
> I just have a couple of minutes and I gotta go.

**[01:20:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Did I understand you correctly that these bioelectrical signals are not being passed down genetically through sperm and egg in our case?

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> And if so,

**[01:21:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> So where are the biogenetic bioelectrical signals for the shaping of certain organs coming from?

**[01:21:07] Michael Levin**
> How are they being generated?

**[01:21:08] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, great question.

**[01:21:11] Michael Levin**
> We don't know if they come through the sperm and egg, actually, that that's still an open question.

**[01:21:15] Michael Levin**
> But let's assume for the moment that they don't.

**[01:21:17] Michael Levin**
> OK, let's say they don't.

**[01:21:19] Michael Levin**
> And let's say that it's generated de novo in each embryo each time.

**[01:21:24] Michael Levin**
> The question of where things come from is a really deep philosophical question, because what you really need to think about is what kind of answer would make you happy.

**[01:21:31] Michael Levin**
> Because pretty much there is no story I can tell you about where it comes from, because then you will ask, well, where does that come from?

**[01:21:38] Michael Levin**
> And so and that's perfectly reasonable.

**[01:21:40] Michael Levin**
> And so we need to ask ourselves, what does it mean when when something comes from somewhere?

**[01:21:45] Michael Levin**
> So I'm going to just give you a very simple analogy for thinking about this.

**[01:21:52] Michael Levin**
> Do you know what a Galton board is every 60 minutes?

**[01:21:55] Michael Levin**
> You can you can you can get a toy of it on Amazon for 20 bucks.

**[01:21:57] Michael Levin**
> It's basically just imagine a vertical wooden board like this.

**[01:22:00] Michael Levin**
> bang a bunch of nails into it, and then you take a bucket of marbles and you dump it in and the marbles go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**[01:22:06] Michael Levin**
> They get to the bottom.

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> What do they do?

**[01:22:07] Michael Levin**
> make a beautiful bell curve, right?

**[01:22:09] Michael Levin**
> They make a Gaussian distribution.

**[01:22:11] Michael Levin**
> So now you can ask a simple question.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Okay, that's a nice shape.

**[01:22:13] Michael Levin**
> Where did that come from?

**[01:22:14] Michael Levin**
> So you're looking at the marbles.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:17] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the nails.

**[01:22:18] Michael Levin**
> It's not there.

**[01:22:19] Michael Levin**
> You're looking at the wood.

**[01:22:20] Michael Levin**
> Also not there.

**[01:22:21] Michael Levin**
> Where did it come from, right?

**[01:22:23] Michael Levin**
> And so somebody says, well, the central limit theorem of calculus, well, that's great.

**[01:22:26] Michael Levin**
> Where is that?

**[01:22:27] Michael Levin**
> And so I think that the question of where it is, is we don't have quite the right vocabulary for it, but I'll tell you overall what I think is happening here.

**[01:22:37] Michael Levin**
> I think that where it is, is the same place where the laws of mathematics come from.

**[01:22:42] Michael Levin**
> if you, you know, like Penrose and other people, if you have a Platonist view of mathematics and you think that there is a space that is not our physical space here, where the laws of mathematics live, where the free gifts of, for example, geometry, right?

**[01:22:54] Michael Levin**
> Evolution, I'd say you're evolving a triangle.

**[01:22:57] Michael Levin**
> know, you could do a bunch of generations and you would get the first angle, right?

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> And that's great.

**[01:23:00] Michael Levin**
> you go by just the generations, you get the second angle.

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> Well, guess what?

**[01:23:02] Michael Levin**
> You don't need to look for the third angle.

**[01:23:04] Michael Levin**
> It's given to you for free because in flat space, you know what the third angle has to be.

**[01:23:07] Michael Levin**
> So where is that?

**[01:23:08] Michael Levin**
> How come evolution gets to save one third of its search time?

**[01:23:12] Michael Levin**
> This is not some philosophical fluff.

**[01:23:14] Michael Levin**
> This is super practical.

**[01:23:16] Michael Levin**
> so I think what is happening here is that in that space, you have really sort of boring, simple things like triangles and levers and the Archimedean machines and things like that.

**[01:23:27] Michael Levin**
> But you also have more complex patterns and that when we build either engineering systems or quote unquote living systems, what you're building is an interface onto some region of Platonic space that uses those affordances and that's what you're going to catch.

**[01:23:42] Michael Levin**
> there are three things we need to track.

**[01:23:44] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the genetics that define the hardware.

**[01:23:47] Michael Levin**
> We need to track the circumstances of the environment because that obviously has an input and we need to track the input, which in the end may be the biggest input of all.

**[01:23:58] Michael Levin**
> I'm not sure.

**[01:24:00] Michael Levin**
> Free lunches, as the physicists would say, because they are neither in the environment nor in the genetics.

**[01:24:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My turn.

**[01:24:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, so this sets the stage for the conversation that's really relevant to this group.

**[01:24:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You, you, you telegraphed that the whole question of cognitive blue was going to be important.

**[01:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:24:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> by the way, it's so nice that you can visualize them and you can sort of it's an emergent phenomenon, which is not magical, and yet, you know, it embodies the system you're talking about, just leaping way ahead, but to make the connection to the concerns of this group.

**[01:24:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a little uncanny how the movement of bioelectric patterns on a spherical cell resembles the move, the movement of weather patterns on the planet.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, this group believes that the planet is an interconnected, or suspects that the planet is this kind of an interconnected system.

**[01:25:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We know that dust from the Sahara is critical for the Amazon, that moisture from the Amazon is critical to weather in the Pacific Northwest, and so on.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's, I mean, may actually, now that you mentioned it, it might include bioelectric fields, but that's probably not the critical mechanism.

**[01:25:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> doesn't have to be.

**[01:25:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Have you given any thought to what it would take to begin to explore these higher-level, multi-organism assemblages, which are probably not stitched together by bioelectric fields, but are clearly stitched together and may have these kinds of unconventional intelligences?

**[01:25:57] Michael Levin**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:58] Michael Levin**
> Okay, yeah, so one of the things that we're working on.

**[01:26:00] Michael Levin**
> out is the properties of the cognitive blue, bi-electricity is not magic, it just it happens to have some cool properties that make it a good cognitive blue, but there are many other kinds of modalities that can do it.

**[01:26:12] Michael Levin**
> And so the question is, what are those properties, right?

**[01:26:14] Michael Levin**
> So this is unfortunate, I gotta go now, but there are aspects of memory anonymization, about stress sharing, about the trust and delegation and offloading.

**[01:26:27] Michael Levin**
> There are some properties that make something a good cognitive blue that enables subunits to bind into larger intelligences.

**[01:26:34] Michael Levin**
> in the case of weather and ecosystems, this is a very common thing, so I'll give my talk, and then somebody says, well, that's, know, that this, this pain psychist view, you know, you might as well say that the weather is, you know, has, is, well, I don't know, if you try to train it, you can't, you can't just say it is, and you can't just say it's not, you need to do experiments.

**[01:26:54] Michael Levin**
> So this is not about having philosophical precommitments to things you have to actually try.

**[01:26:59] Michael Levin**
> So, you know,

**[01:27:00] Michael Levin**
> training actual weather is probably prohibitively expensive, but what we have done is grab various simulators of economic systems of water transportation.

**[01:27:11] Michael Levin**
> We haven't done weather yet, but I think somebody should.

**[01:27:13] Michael Levin**
> if anybody on this call has access to weather simulators, we could collaborate on this.

**[01:27:18] Michael Levin**
> It's pretty straightforward now to actually ask, are the, and I've written papers about this, about just like, how do you study these unconventional systems?

**[01:27:27] Michael Levin**
> Pretty easy now to ask the model whether it predicts that there will be what kind of memory?

**[01:27:35] Michael Levin**
> Does it do anticipation?

**[01:27:36] Michael Levin**
> Does it do generalization?

**[01:27:38] Michael Levin**
> Does it do associative learning?

**[01:27:39] Michael Levin**
> There's a whole, there's a dozen things you would want to check for.

**[01:27:42] Michael Levin**
> We could start with models.

**[01:27:43] Michael Levin**
> And then if you get a strong prediction, then some of it's probably out of, people say stuff about the universe too, the whole universe.

**[01:27:52] Michael Levin**
> Maybe we don't have access to the, we can't do experiments at that scale, but you can do it in models.

**[01:27:58] Michael Levin**
> And I think you can learn a lot from that.

**[01:28:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I know you have people who've been waiting outside your door, but actually with your last answer, you've invited us to follow up with you on what would it take to pursue some of the higher level questions.

**[01:28:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will write you and say, I'd like your papers on what it would take to pursue higher level questions.

**[01:28:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then I'll ask you whether there has been a seminar of some sort that tries to bring together higher level question type people to deal with these larger systems and we'll continue the conversation.

**[01:28:32] Michael Levin**
> Sure, cool.

**[01:28:33] Michael Levin**
> Yeah, thank you so much.

**[01:28:34] Michael Levin**
> Thank you everybody for the opportunity and for your questions.

**[01:28:36] Michael Levin**
> you.

**[01:28:37] Michael Levin**
> All right, bye bye.

**[01:28:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Deep breath.

**[01:28:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for hanging in.

**[01:28:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I appreciate that you all stuck through it, it's abstract, it's fire hose, I think it's deeply relevant but may not be of interest to many people in this group but it's a conversation I'm really glad that we've had and I think it puts some legitimacy and some structure around the fuzzier arguments that we have between meetings, if you will, like it's really just mind-blowing science.

**[01:29:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> turning to the agenda and recognizing that we have 25 minutes, Colombo.

**[01:29:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At a very different scale of being, Colombo is working in Nakavali, he's developing

**[01:30:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's presented it to us, to some extent in the past, and he wrote it up and shared it in the forum.

**[01:30:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The steering committee looked at his proposal.

**[01:30:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We said, you know, this guy is doing really good work.

**[01:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's really making progress.

**[01:30:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's adopting the discipline of writing these things up and responding to these kinds of things.

**[01:30:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He's already raised $15,000 if I remember correctly.

**[01:30:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He needs a mere another $4,500.

**[01:30:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Can we help him go over the edge?

**[01:30:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> with our preliminary review, the steering committee doesn't make decisions, Colombo.

**[01:30:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We are going to be recommending to the community that we support your proposal through a matching grant, which if we can get individuals to donate $1,500.

**[01:31:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will be matching a two for one, which means that would be $3,000 more, which means you would get $4,500.

**[01:31:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First, Colombo, I'm going to ask you if that makes sense, and if it would be acceptable, what you think you should be telling us about your project and your progress that will guide our decision making, or if you want to give us an overview, et cetera.

**[01:31:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The floor is yours.

**[01:31:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just wanted to make you understand that we appreciate your work.

**[01:31:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've been looking at it, and we have sort of a proposition for collaboration with you if you're interested.

**[01:31:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah.

**[01:31:38] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Thank you, John, and everyone.

**[01:31:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I think my network is okay.

**[01:31:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I just have a small presentation, which is very brief.

**[01:31:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I know we are all exhausted.

**[01:31:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The presentation of Mike was being long, but I just wanted to share a few slides to see, to show where the idea of developing this project came from and what we want to

**[01:32:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> to achieve great so yeah so basically to those that say to those that say do not know me I have a background in social work and social administration but I'm a resident of McKeverley since 2005 but my passion is so much in elevating poverty among the agonized communities and improving the system and the diversity.

**[01:32:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I work with different people because I represent the youth at UNHCRA level at the county level yeah I'm also a member of ERRA and I'm a member for valuation of action for part of their youth constituents and the MECO founder and executive director of one of the refugee organization.

**[01:33:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So for us to come up with this proposal, we looked at key things that are affecting the lives of refugees in Naki Valley, and one of them is the framework that the refugee response, most of them have been fashioned because when we look at the history of Naki Valley, it was the Naki Valley was established in 1958 with the status in 1960, and all these framework were drafted because it was to be a transition center or a transition place.

**[01:33:40] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People could come for a period of time and then go back to their countries, but because that one didn't work because it was made for Rwanda and Tutsi because of the genocide that had happened in Rwanda, to come and set off for a few time, then after their country gets peace, then they go back, but now there's a

**[01:34:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> lot of cases of protractedness where refugees, they come, they stay for a longer period, like personnel have been here for the last 19 years.

**[01:34:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and this one has increased over dependence on humanitarian aid because the framework that we had drafted, they're just looking at humanitarian aid will come for a few months or for a few years.

**[01:34:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They get humanitarian aid maybe from WFP or from UNICEF and then they go back to their countries.

**[01:34:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But because of this, poverty level has been high and also there has been a very big impact on environment because people need land for shelter, for agriculture, for animals, for wood.

**[01:34:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This one is causing a lot of pressure on environment and even the livelihood of people.

**[01:34:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but again, currently Uganda itself is surrounded by dormant and active volcanoes.

**[01:34:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So like in the countries that are producing refugees every day or that they are to produce refugees.

**[01:34:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Like currently, basically the characteristics.

**[01:35:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Uganda or Nakiavalu, we are having around 180,000 refugees and there are 200,000 refugees in the transition center at the border of Ufodiara Sea who are here to come to Uganda, though most of them do not come to Nakiavalu but they'll be spread to different refugee settlements.

**[01:35:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So it means the pressure on food security is going to become high and also the pressure to the environment is also going to increase but again the humanitarian assistance is also reducing because of the current wars that's happening in DRC and it's also done also Gaza and also Ukraine that's where most of the aid is going.

**[01:35:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these other refugee settlements that were set long ago so there's a lot of decrease in the humanitarian aid and this is making people to become more vulnerable and most of them they can't even afford their daily meals.

**[01:35:55] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now after looking at all this really key we have been here at least so

**[01:36:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> For the settlement, we have gotten an experience of living in the settlement which will come up with some solutions that are going to make the settlement a better place for other generations that are coming because most people don't know or they don't want to do the conservation activities.

**[01:36:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we look at some of the solutions that we could do because like now.

**[01:36:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The settlement is around 185 square kilometers and it has a population for approximately 180,000 and also more people are coming.

**[01:36:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then the land itself cannot expand because it is inelastic.

**[01:36:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now the only solution is to look for the ways of restoring the underutilized and degraded lands to make sure we put them in two use so that as people are coming, at least they don't just rely on the wetlands or on the flat surfaces, but also on other underutilized land, they make it in two use.

**[01:37:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they can support themselves to improve their livelihood and also their ecosystem.

**[01:37:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also we're looking at empowering these local actors with the resources to solve their own problems.

**[01:37:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They should just not just be waiting for the problem to be judged or to be solved by externals, but we should develop our own problem and our own solutions to solve our own problems.

**[01:37:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also there's also very many private sectors have also begun showing the interest of working in the settlement for to get the agro-based materials.

**[01:37:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again, when we look at the productivity of the land is still less and they really don't have enough to give to these industries.

**[01:37:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why earlier this week, I mean earlier this year, we had to take a trip to one of the districts in Uganda called Kasese, which is very healing.

**[01:37:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But people are surviving on agriculture, people are restoring it, so the picture is

**[01:38:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> showing me and my team, when we can see what has enabled them to make sure, even if their land is healing, what's enabling them to make sure agriculture is thriving.

**[01:38:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because also we have other hills because like you can see what to approach the office of the prime minister, departments of refugees for land.

**[01:38:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So now we requested over 300 acres of land and good enough because we have good election ship.

**[01:38:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They gave us 300 but now we first want to restore 150 acres.

**[01:38:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But again God that was the only limiting factor for us to get what we wanted.

**[01:38:42] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then also had to approach the national forest authority for the trees because purchasing trees would be very expensive to us so we had to approach them.

**[01:38:52] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then they had to come, they do the due diligence and part of the due diligence is to measure the ability of the soil for the ice.

**[01:38:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> It can be

**[01:39:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> able to support agriculture and the growth and also the trees.

**[01:39:05] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then we had some local expertise from the local government and also from other implementing partners around so they have to do all the due diligence and then they supported us with the, they're going to support us with the required number of trees that we wanted.

**[01:39:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So, but unfortunately, they were only able to give us fine and full space.

**[01:39:27] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But good enough, when we wrote, when we came to ERAA, showing them what we have, there was a lot of debate on why should we go with the monoculture, then we had to use our local connections, then we had to interact with the local governments, then they gave us other three species to make sure we have four different species.

**[01:39:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the soil has been tested, it can be able to do the agriculture and the agroforestry part and also that trees, we're not doing monoculture.

**[01:40:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> culture, but you're doing other things.

**[01:40:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now these are some of the steps that we are looking at to make sure because this is the vision that we have, that our land, all these underutilized lands in a few years to come, this is the way they should look like.

**[01:40:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Because you can see people are doing terracing, people are going and doing some agroforestry, but these are also these other places are also hidden.

**[01:40:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But now if these people were able to do this, why not as we can also do this.

**[01:40:28] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So I know it is challenging because it's the first time, but we shall keep learning from them.

**[01:40:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We shall also keep learning from ARAE to make sure this one is done and this one is achieved for us to make sure because the goal is to at least restore 10,000 in five years, 10,000 acres, but want to start small and then keep growing slowly.

**[01:40:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So first we shall go through various steps and one would be to create the contour ditches around the hills to make sure we increase the water filtration rates and also to minimize the effects of solar

**[01:41:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> the region.

**[01:41:01] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But after doing that, we shall also have to dig some holes and deep holes, which will be we can bring the trees from.

**[01:41:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since the soil has never been used for agriculture for long, we want to apply organic manure, and especially cow dung, that's what we can do very easily, to apply in these holes to make sure at least some fertility is added to the soils.

**[01:41:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a period of time, they shall also have to plant the trees, but at different intervals, because we want to use it for different purposes.

**[01:41:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Some will be used for agriculture in the future, others to support the community with the wood fuel from the branches, and also another part to support other economic activities, like beekeeping and also for animal rearing.

**[01:41:50] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the objective of this is to just minimize the pressure that this bee population is putting on the low land to make sure we increase also the number of eggs.

**[01:42:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> because the number of land to be exploited.

**[01:42:02] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but as I said, we have the tree species that we have now that we are going to get.

**[01:42:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have pine, we have baobar, we have moringa, moringa oleifera, and the forest trees.

**[01:42:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> This is what we are able to get because we had other tree species.

**[01:42:19] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But when we ask the local government and also the National Forest Authority, they are able to provide.

**[01:42:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But at the moment, that's what we shall start with.

**[01:42:29] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But since it's a long-term project, not just this one, we shall place our order, which is still early to them.

**[01:42:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's it.

**[01:42:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> At least if they're prepared for next season and next year, at least they have that in mind.

**[01:42:41] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And if they fail, we shall probably, next year, set our own nursery beds, tree beds, and make sure we grow these trees from our nurseries then after we can apply them for other generation plants.

**[01:42:56] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also, as I said, the solar building has been...

**[01:43:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, has been has been tested and commanded by Samizi is the implementing partner and therefore that's it is possible to look after environments in the settlement in partnership with local government, which is a single district.

**[01:43:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So they are the ones that do do the due diligence.

**[01:43:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after you command to national forest.

**[01:43:21] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> that's why my last slide.

**[01:43:23] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So based on all this, we have only three major requests to air a and one of them is the financial support because we also had to do some fundraising.

**[01:43:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Before, make sure our dream comes true.

**[01:43:37] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And we fundraised up to 15,000 US dollars based on our local local fundraising skills up to 15,000 but our total budget was up to 19,500.

**[01:43:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we had a gap of 4,500 we said, but remember of air and we have people that she wants to see a community safe.

**[01:44:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> sufficient and which is the supporting ecosystem can come and put this proposal to them for their support.

**[01:44:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, but also once this project to attract many people and many donors for us to achieve the number of acres that wants to achieve.

**[01:44:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> That's why it's our prayer that we will include also part of the projects because I think I shared the locations of the projects where they would be, on two different hills, I shared in the documents on a Google Drive.

**[01:44:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> mean, on Google Earth, yeah, also if they can include this part of these locations to the ARAA projects to make sure when, as other people are reading, they can also see what is happening.

**[01:44:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But the other support is the technical support because it's not only this, but we have many things to do and we know there are very many experts in ARAA who can maybe recommend other trees or other methodologies or refer us to other people.

**[01:45:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So those are the few things that I have for the interest of time and they will come if there are questions or suggestions or supplements or any support.

**[01:45:11] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and thank you very much for listening.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:45:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:45:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Colombo, I'm wondering about planting of non-trees.

**[01:45:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What's going to be on the ground in between all of these trees?

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you figured out what kinds of species would complement the trees and perhaps protect the soil and perhaps help feed the people?

**[01:45:44] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, John, I think that's where I may be.

**[01:45:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I have no thoughts about that, but that's where maybe you are advised as I suggested.

**[01:45:53] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So from the various that we have now, which one should be planted?

**[01:45:57] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> The cover trees and which one should be planted?

**[01:45:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yes, as we're also making

**[01:46:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> You know, this part is for this kind of species, maybe this part is for this, but see for now, that's what we have.

**[01:46:07] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Those are three species that we have, but we need more guidance from from, from you.

**[01:46:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're not going to get it from me personally, because I'm not an expert, but we do have experts and I think they can be very useful here.

**[01:46:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, your hand is up, Kwaki, yours was up for a minute.

**[01:46:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob.

**[01:46:29] Rob De Laet**
> I thank you for great work.

**[01:46:32] Rob De Laet**
> I just want to ask John, basically how we mark if we want to do a donation.

**[01:46:39] Rob De Laet**
> The 2nd 1.

**[01:46:41] Rob De Laet**
> You can ask that straight away.

**[01:46:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will create.

**[01:46:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> will.

**[01:46:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Colombo, would you please add the links to your documents to the PowerPoint that you just gave and share the PowerPoint with me?

**[01:46:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will then take your recorded presentation and the PowerPoint.

**[01:47:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And write a proposal to the larger community, which will also include a link to a button on the era open collective website where people will be able to donate to columbos project.

**[01:47:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the short answer to your question.

**[01:47:18] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[01:47:20] Rob De Laet**
> My, my second question is in line with what you were asking.

**[01:47:24] Rob De Laet**
> I think it would be very good to have somebody who's very good at permaculture and that kind of thing to do the specific design, sort of the micro design of what intercropping you can do, which can help a lot protecting your ground.

**[01:47:47] Rob De Laet**
> Improving your crops and the growth rates, but again, like John, we only know that these people exist.

**[01:47:55] Rob De Laet**
> I am certainly not an expert.

**[01:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> But so do you have access to this expertise or other.

**[01:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Otherwise, we should be able maybe to locate somebody who could do that work with you.

**[01:48:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that is something.

**[01:48:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a timely question.

**[01:48:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin, maybe the kind of person who could advise you.

**[01:48:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Michael Polarski was here, maybe a good source, but Colombo, should keep at us.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've done a great job of sort of being proactive and persistent.

**[01:48:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You got to keep doing that in order to get the help from this community that we are here to give, but you have to be here to demand from us.

**[01:48:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joaquin.

**[01:48:41] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yes.

**[01:48:42] Coakee Wildcat**
> Hey, thank you Colombo for that presentation.

**[01:48:44] Coakee Wildcat**
> That's very inspiring.

**[01:48:45] Coakee Wildcat**
> What a beautiful solution to some of the problems facing these weekends and fully in support of that.

**[01:48:52] Coakee Wildcat**
> Yeah, I think since topic agroforestry would be the way to go because we accelerate ecological success.

**[01:49:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> in that form of agroforestry, it's a successional agroforestry that works with ecosystems.

**[01:49:04] Coakee Wildcat**
> I did not hear the specific request for help in the agricultural system, but if there is a request, I would be happy to share everything I know to connect you with those resources if I were able to be there.

**[01:49:18] Coakee Wildcat**
> You know, I'd be happy to teach since topic agroforestry, it's a system out of Brazil that mixes the indigenous agroforestry systems, which are very advanced there, with some modern western science in ecology, soil science, plant physiology, etc.

**[01:49:35] Coakee Wildcat**
> It's very effective at maximizing the fertility and productivity of lands quickly by moving ecological succession forward and maximizing the rate of accumulation of organic matter and soil and plant biodiversity, etc.

**[01:49:51] Coakee Wildcat**
> And so if that interest were there, I'd happy to, I have a, I'd really, I would be very happy to help in any way I could in that.

**[01:50:00] Coakee Wildcat**
> I wonder what a big picture, you were able to get some system of regenerative agriculture or agroecology moving well around that area, would you be thinking about further like increasing the radius with ecological restoration like just native species reforestation or something like that at a larger radius around that area?

**[01:50:26] Coakee Wildcat**
> What would a long-term region be for that?

**[01:50:30] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, that's the vision to expand the radius.

**[01:50:36] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> as long as we all the resources and all the needed resources, that's the goal because we want to support a big area and also to empower very many people.

**[01:50:48] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's why also as Rob suggested, we also want to include in permaculture so that people are also able to grow food because like even now there's also land crisis where some

**[01:51:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> People have some homeless people in the camp and also others, there's also some issues of land fragmentation, which is creating a lot of problems to people, but if at all you can go and extra mile and have a very big land under restoration, then some of these other issues come to the something directly.

**[01:51:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so we will proceed with this.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I wanted to ask you to make sure to put a link to your map into the presentation and to your budget into the presentation.

**[01:51:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> people are going to have, people will know how the money is going to be used and how you're going to do it.

**[01:51:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the work here?

**[01:51:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who does the actual planting?

**[01:51:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do they get paid and so on?

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How does the labor component figure into this?

**[01:51:59] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, John, I think you're

**[01:52:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> I had provided the budgets in the whole documents, but I can pull it and then I shade separately with the more details.

**[01:52:08] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, and also with this presentation plus the plus the map, as you suggested.

**[01:52:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:52:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> My last question has to do with tell us about your workforce.

**[01:52:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who will do the work under what kinds of conditions?

**[01:52:25] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Okay.

**[01:52:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So here we have an implementing partner called the SAMISI.

**[01:52:34] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> they have a project that they do with the unit Sierra and they are the ones that they have all the technical personnel for planning, for training and we have a very good, we are in touch with them and we have a very good partnership with them.

**[01:52:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, because they even the ones who provided us with the recommendation to go to National Forest Authorities.

**[01:52:58] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> in our planning, we have

**[01:53:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We are looking at them as the key people, maybe to subcontracts for technical assistance on the ground, because they have all those skills, they have those personnel, because like personally, I know I can do something but I can't do much.

**[01:53:15] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And this one needs people that have experience, people who have ever done it.

**[01:53:18] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, so that's we are looking at, but we have also a big team.

**[01:53:22] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We have 10 in number, very energetic, very young and very passionate, but when it comes to the real planting and real training.

**[01:53:31] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So want to subcontract those ones, because they'll provide cheap labor because they have another funding and they have a mandate of working after environment in the settlement.

**[01:53:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this, you've got this team of professional consultants and trainers who will do some of the work and do the training.

**[01:53:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They will be training who your group of 10 or your group of 10 becomes trainers for the larger community or what.

**[01:54:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Not really, John, as I put in the proposal, we want to use the community members because we want the lands to belong to the community.

**[01:54:10] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> and previously we have been supporting other groups of people with our previous projects.

**[01:54:16] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we have what to call village savings and loan associations.

**[01:54:20] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So these people, they have an average of 15 members and we have, we have very many, but you're going to choose some of them that are near by those hills.

**[01:54:32] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So we are looking at maybe if you can empower 10 of them, because if we bought 10 of them, those are 150 already.

**[01:54:39] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We just give them small supports to put into the savings accounts and then they can do the work.

**[01:54:45] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then it should be this some music for the consultants who will train them how to do that, but some of our team members and we have to be making sure they're there when they are digging ditches, when they are planting.

**[01:55:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> When they're doing anything, so that's the strategy that's what it is.

**[01:55:03] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that's even after some time, even if I'm not there, even if I'm out of my family, but that's the plan is there is being looked at and it belongs to the community.

**[01:55:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think those are really good answers to to the questions.

**[01:55:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments for Colombo?

**[01:55:22] Alex Bal**
> I just have a question.

**[01:55:23] Alex Bal**
> Yeah, I have a question around the elders from the area or the elders.

**[01:55:27] Alex Bal**
> Are you inviting the elders to come and help rebuild the stories around the land?

**[01:55:33] Alex Bal**
> Because I know in Canada, that's a very big component of restoration is making sure that the culture of the area has stories, either the ancestral stories or news stories that help kind of keep the community engaged with with the land.

**[01:55:51] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Yeah, yes, Alex, we have some elders, but see, though they have, okay, I know they have, but we have some who can tell the story as I say,

**[01:56:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> In a presentation, we have what's the protracted refugees, those that have been here for the last 19, 20, 30, 50 years.

**[01:56:09] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> They are not necessarily elders, but at least they have experienced, they've been around for maybe the last two decades or three or four.

**[01:56:17] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And I think somewhere in the budget, I think of an NBE where I want to make sure that the story of this land is told.

**[01:56:26] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> We once, before doing anything, we first take the image of the place to show people how it has been.

**[01:56:33] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> And then after maybe doing the ditches, after making the holes, also take another video using drone to show people what has been done.

**[01:56:43] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Then after a couple of months, when we have done some restoration, we can take another one of the land.

**[01:56:47] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> So that would be one of the story.

**[01:56:49] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> But also maybe you can also create something like interviews with some other people and also show the people, maybe some people may not be who they

**[01:57:00] KALOMBO-MBILIZI**
> Technology, but as with the stories, they can really understand the whole concept and where the land has come from and where it's where it has been.

**[01:57:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, hey, we have a few more minutes and I'm looking at the agenda, we've actually covered the main points.

**[01:57:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, but I will give you all one more item, a preview of our new directory.

**[01:57:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would like your comments on it, but sometime soon, sometime soon, we're going to Click that's okay.

**[01:57:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, this is our website You

**[01:58:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's hidden, but there exists a member directory now.

**[01:58:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will soon be getting an email inviting you to claim your membership.

**[01:58:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is the test.

**[01:58:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If I search for Colombo, there he is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this is the information we have.

**[01:58:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But once you get the email, you'll be able to modify this information.

**[01:58:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be exposed to the public, along with all of your social media links, as well as your location, if we have your location.

**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you'll be able to add the location and so on.

**[01:58:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There is also a private directory, which looks just like this, but you can determine whether, for example, you want to share phone numbers with the public or with your own members.

**[01:59:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There will be basically a member space and a public space.

**[01:59:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to customize your description and the information you want in the, in each space.

**[01:59:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And this will be the beginning of a directory that will allow facilitate you finding each other.

**[01:59:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll be able to find Kwaki's phone number if he chooses to share it Colombo and then call him and say you promise to help me but it's been a week already.

**[01:59:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So where's my answer and that kind of thing.

**[01:59:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will also say that once we have a directory.

**[01:59:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to start encouraging members to become.

**[01:59:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you will donors to the era at whatever level.

**[01:59:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They are comfortable with this is not a required donation, but there will be a little badge in the directory for people who are.

**[02:00:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> in fact signed up to donate a penny a month or a dollar a month or a hundred dollars a month.

**[02:00:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We won't be distinguishing them, but it would be really great if everybody who is in the Alliance also is registered as a supporter.

**[02:00:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's sort of the way we're going to try to have a little bit more money in the budget to support projects like plumbos.

**[02:00:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there you go, sort of an interesting cross-section of what we do here.

**[02:00:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's 10.56.

**[02:00:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have no other items that I really want to get to.

**[02:00:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Anyone have anything they want to say or throw in in the four minutes that remain?

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[02:00:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you everybody.

**[02:00:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for being here.

**[02:00:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:56:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Eduardo, are you with us?

**[00:56:28] Eduardo Marino**
> And are you ready?

**[00:56:29] Eduardo Marino**
> Yes, yes.

**[00:56:31] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[00:56:33] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, greetings to everyone.

**[00:56:40] Eduardo Marino**
> I have distributed some notes to John and colleagues, but the title of my presentation says everything.

**[00:56:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The title is Greening the Central American Pacific Coast.

**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

**[01:53:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Usman.

**[01:53:32] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:00] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> this with a very important biodiversity, but now it's just like almost like a lunar landscape.

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, everybody.

**[01:57:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

```
**[00:56:28] Eduardo Marino**
> And are you ready?

**[00:56:29] Eduardo Marino**
> Yes, yes.

**[00:56:31] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[00:56:33] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, greetings to everyone.

**[00:56:40] Eduardo Marino**
> I have distributed some notes to John and colleagues, but the title of my presentation says everything.

**[00:56:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The title is Greening the Central American Pacific Coast.

**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, everybody.

**[01:57:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, well.

### Mention 3: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 123985:*
```
**[00:56:29] Eduardo Marino**
> Yes, yes.

**[00:56:31] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[00:56:33] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, greetings to everyone.

**[00:56:40] Eduardo Marino**
> I have distributed some notes to John and colleagues, but the title of my presentation says everything.

**[00:56:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The title is Greening the Central American Pacific Coast.

**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

**[01:53:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Usman.

**[01:53:32] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:00] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> this with a very important biodiversity, but now it's just like almost like a lunar landscape.

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, everybody.

**[01:57:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

### Mention 4: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 123988:*
```
**[00:56:31] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[00:56:33] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, greetings to everyone.

**[00:56:40] Eduardo Marino**
> I have distributed some notes to John and colleagues, but the title of my presentation says everything.

**[00:56:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The title is Greening the Central American Pacific Coast.

**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

**[01:53:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Usman.

**[01:53:32] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:00] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> this with a very important biodiversity, but now it's just like almost like a lunar landscape.

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, everybody.

**[01:57:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

### Mention 5: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 123991:*
```
**[00:56:33] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, greetings to everyone.

**[00:56:40] Eduardo Marino**
> I have distributed some notes to John and colleagues, but the title of my presentation says everything.

**[00:56:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The title is Greening the Central American Pacific Coast.

**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

**[01:53:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Usman.

**[01:53:32] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:00] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> this with a very important biodiversity, but now it's just like almost like a lunar landscape.

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, everybody.

**[01:57:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

### Mention 6: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 123994:*
```
**[00:56:40] Eduardo Marino**
> I have distributed some notes to John and colleagues, but the title of my presentation says everything.

**[00:56:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The title is Greening the Central American Pacific Coast.

**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

**[01:53:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Usman.

**[01:53:32] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:00] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> this with a very important biodiversity, but now it's just like almost like a lunar landscape.

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, everybody.

**[01:57:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

### Mention 7: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 123997:*
```
**[00:56:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The title is Greening the Central American Pacific Coast.

**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

### Mention 8: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 124000:*
```
**[00:57:00] Eduardo Marino**
> just dry corridor.

**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

**[01:53:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Usman.

**[01:53:32] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:00] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> this with a very important biodiversity, but now it's just like almost like a lunar landscape.

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, everybody.

**[01:57:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

### Mention 9: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 124003:*
```
**[00:57:04] Eduardo Marino**
> How best to contain the massive people forced immigration normals?

**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**
> My name is Moses.

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much, Moses.

**[01:53:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Usman.

**[01:53:32] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> Hi, John.

**[01:53:33] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> I'm pleased to be in this circle and to reconnect, of course, after meeting in New York.

**[01:53:44] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And yeah, I am calling from Senegal and in the north of Senegal, we are working with 100 villages across the border when we're trying to green the land, because we used to have four

**[01:54:00] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> this with a very important biodiversity, but now it's just like almost like a lunar landscape.

**[01:54:06] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> No trees and we are bringing communities together from Senegal and Mauritania 100 total to produce trees and also create, you know, community food forests.

**[01:54:21] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> recently we've had, you know, one of the most devastating, devastating, know, floods, which have destroyed also a lot of the work we have been doing all these years.

**[01:54:35] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And we're also ready to start again.

**[01:54:38] Ousmane Aly Pame**
> And so please to be in this circle.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:54:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you so much.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, when I hear about these floods, I always think about all of the water that could be soaking into the ground.

**[01:54:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is it understood that it's actually a gift to be harvested, or is it just treated as a disaster?

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> sure to be avoided well i guess both because in the past people used to grow millet you know organic millet and so also you know these floods you know they bring a lot of nutrients to the soil etc and i think really maybe our authority should think bigger and create you know revive all these fossil rivers where we can also stock part of these waters for agriculture for also herding and it's just part of the of the projects very good we have made it two and then four minutes past 1104 i did want to see whether sol moran was in a position to say hello she's been a member of the era for quite some time she's been fighting the good fight in israel

**[01:56:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and has been involved in these efforts.

**[01:56:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> she's still connected, although I don't see her tile here.

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so it was nice.

**[01:56:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, you are here.

**[01:56:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But you may not be able to join us.

**[01:56:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So let me say thank you everybody for stimulating and concise presentations for your tolerance of a disorderly beginning and for doing what you can to use our forum to continue these conversations and turn talk into action.

**[01:56:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You will all be enrolled in our forum soon if you're not already, but it's a good way to give us all some visibility into what we are all doing.

**[01:56:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> At the same time, being a do-overcy that you just go and do it and give other people

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> a chance to catch up and support you.

**[01:57:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

### Mention 10: ERA Town Hall Meeting
*Line 124006:*
```
**[00:57:16] Eduardo Marino**
> The problem I'm addressing and sharing with you has to do with the massive immigration of several million Central Americans walking northwards as from the year 2018.

**[00:57:44] Eduardo Marino**
> This is not what is very interesting is this is not a very old problem is what exactly happened in the year 2018 when

**[00:58:00] Eduardo Marino**
> people began, more and more men, women and children began leaving their homes in seven Central American countries and started to walk northwards towards to Mexico and the United and California.

**[00:58:25] Eduardo Marino**
> At one moment, there were three million people walking with their children.

**[00:58:38] Eduardo Marino**
> What happened clearly coincides with the COVID pandemic, but I don't know whether it is a coincidence because I have not seen any scientific document relating the COVID pandemic to the drawing

**[00:59:00] Eduardo Marino**
> of the soil, what is commonly called the desertification.

**[00:59:08] Eduardo Marino**
> I'm talking about it is the whole area between Panama in the south and California in the north, and that means Costa Rica, Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico.

**[00:59:37] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about 180 million people.

**[00:59:44] Eduardo Marino**
> The population potentially affected, if one adds the population of all these countries, is 180 million people, and it continues.

**[00:59:58] Eduardo Marino**
> It could reach the 200 million.

**[01:00:01] Eduardo Marino**
> Then, my proposal, it's exactly the name of Ida, this requires a soil restoration, massive, large operation.

**[01:00:24] Eduardo Marino**
> In the process of doing the restoration, we will understand more and more what has happened, but there is no need to wait for more scientific research before starting acting.

**[01:00:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And this is a good moment to act because the issue has been politicized and the new U.S.

**[01:00:59] Eduardo Marino**
> government

**[01:01:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has clearly announced, new president-elect Trump, that he will go into a massive expulsion of immigrants, illegal immigrants.

**[01:01:15] Eduardo Marino**
> He had, he had, I'm not blaming him, I'm not criticizing, I'm recording the facts, because it's consistent with his policy and his decisions during his first, during his first video.

**[01:01:33] Eduardo Marino**
> And then what, what is quite negative is that this problem over the last five years has been, has been, been treated as a police problem, as an army and police problem.

**[01:01:51] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the women and the men, as a frontier problem, as delinquents.

**[01:02:02] Eduardo Marino**
> Because what happened with the dry corridor was that agriculture collapsed.

**[01:02:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And those seven countries are 100% farming countries.

**[01:02:19] Eduardo Marino**
> There is very little industry in Central America.

**[01:02:23] Eduardo Marino**
> They are farming agricultural countries.

**[01:02:26] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the crisis from 2018 up to this current moment is a crisis of hunger and unemployment.

**[01:02:45] Eduardo Marino**
> Then the question now is how to do it.

**[01:02:50] Eduardo Marino**
> It's clear that it must be done.

**[01:02:52] Eduardo Marino**
> The question is how to do the restoration.

**[01:03:00] Eduardo Marino**
> We have the figures.

**[01:03:06] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, there is not the first time that this crisis happened.

**[01:03:14] Eduardo Marino**
> This, we have a lot to learn from the Middle East.

**[01:03:20] Eduardo Marino**
> This happened massively in Northern Africa and West Asia, long time ago.

**[01:03:28] Eduardo Marino**
> The crisis in Northern Africa and the crisis in the Middle East are a soil crisis.

**[01:03:36] Eduardo Marino**
> It was the certification massively.

**[01:03:40] Eduardo Marino**
> That is what has produced war for decades, for centuries.

**[01:03:46] Eduardo Marino**
> That has been the main cause of war in the Middle East.

**[01:03:52] Eduardo Marino**
> And then the end of agriculture in the Middle East, the crisis of agriculture may be

**[01:04:00] Eduardo Marino**
> This country is 100% dependent of oil.

**[01:04:04] Eduardo Marino**
> Oil became the big solution 100 years ago, during the last 100 years, as income for those countries.

**[01:04:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Those countries where agriculture was the beginning.

**[01:04:22] Eduardo Marino**
> Agriculture started in the watershed of the Nile.

**[01:04:28] Eduardo Marino**
> This Egypt and of Iraq, the Euphratesia and the Nile, that was the paradise of agriculture.

**[01:04:39] Eduardo Marino**
> And it was a soils crisis, like the one that's happening now in Central America, what is at the root of the Middle East war over the last 200 years.

**[01:04:52] Eduardo Marino**
> I learned about this personally as a student.

**[01:05:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Because in one university holiday, I went to Israel and I got lost in the Sinai.

**[01:05:11] Eduardo Marino**
> And luckily, I ended up in the Kibbutz, who saved my life in the year 2001.

**[01:05:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Bejjubrin, 60 kilometers southwest from Jerusalem.

**[01:05:29] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, I loved to stay and I stayed in the Kibbutz half a year.

**[01:05:38] Eduardo Marino**
> And I learned, because I saw it with my eyes and I knew it myself, soil restoration.

**[01:05:45] Eduardo Marino**
> All the Israeli Kibbutz were pieces of it in the desert, in which they managed to collect the water in such a way that Israel hasn't.

**[01:06:00] Eduardo Marino**
> has a significant acreage of agriculture.

**[01:06:05] Eduardo Marino**
> We use beautiful oranges without chemicals, times that the kibbutzilians learn to do soil restoration, including, mainly, water management without chemicals.

**[01:06:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Then we have to learn from the Middle East to the countries which have managed to do soil restoration.

**[01:06:41] Eduardo Marino**
> And then, clearly, many, the same has happened in many African countries.

**[01:06:49] Eduardo Marino**
> Therefore, this era of proposal as a restoration alliance is of the highest priority in the world.

**[01:07:00] Eduardo Marino**
> Food and agriculture comes from the soils.

**[01:07:05] Eduardo Marino**
> What we have agreed and understood over the last few months, I call it the New Holy Trinity.

**[01:07:14] Eduardo Marino**
> The New Holy Trinity is soils, forest, and water.

**[01:07:21] Eduardo Marino**
> If we combine the three, we have the solution and that's the proposal that we can adopt and work on in the dry corridor of Central America.

**[01:07:39] Eduardo Marino**
> There's a good degree of reforestation, water management, and soils restoration.

**[01:07:47] Eduardo Marino**
> Now, how?

**[01:07:50] Eduardo Marino**
> So far, I have been in touch with a group of farmers in Central America.

**[01:07:58] Eduardo Marino**
> They are doing that.

**[01:08:00] Eduardo Marino**
> organized with headquarters in Costa Rica, and they could work with us, but thinking and discussing with them, I'm clear that the size of the problem cannot be solved by a group of technicians or small group of farmers.

**[01:08:20] Eduardo Marino**
> The solution is community restoration.

**[01:08:23] Eduardo Marino**
> It has the communities massively.

**[01:08:28] Eduardo Marino**
> Instead of working more work, we must have a kind of organization in which the communities themselves do the solution in the same way that Israeli, Chinese did it.

**[01:08:48] Eduardo Marino**
> It was done by the people.

**[01:08:52] Eduardo Marino**
> Then that's the proposal I'm bringing to this meeting.

**[01:08:57] Eduardo Marino**
> As I said,

**[01:09:00] Eduardo Marino**
> The figures are significant.

**[01:09:02] Eduardo Marino**
> We are talking about the population of hundred and hundred eighty mediums and the problem continues.

**[01:09:11] Eduardo Marino**
> people Today, there have been growing number of people walking downwards.

**[01:09:19] Eduardo Marino**
> Then our first contribution is to produce a policy paper, an on time for the inauguration of the new US government.

**[01:09:35] Eduardo Marino**
> As a contribution, as a positive contribution, based on science and based on geographical knowledge, good mapping.

**[01:09:44] Eduardo Marino**
> That the solution is not to call the police and call the army.

**[01:09:50] Eduardo Marino**
> To stop the children and the people from walking when they are escaping from hunger and unemployment.

**[01:10:03] Eduardo Marino**
> Last, we could start with coffee.

**[01:10:07] Eduardo Marino**
> Coffee is a, all those are coffee countries.

**[01:10:13] Eduardo Marino**
> And coffee is a commodity which the prices have gone up.

**[01:10:21] Eduardo Marino**
> Fruit, the problem with coffee is that you cannot hide hunger with coffee.

**[01:10:28] Eduardo Marino**
> You can keep the people awake with coffee, but we need to consider what will be the agriculture, the program to meet hunger.

**[01:10:49] Eduardo Marino**
> There are institutions that we can talk to have the alliance.

**[01:10:58] Eduardo Marino**
> The main one.

**[01:11:00] Eduardo Marino**
> is found from the United Nations.

**[01:11:03] Eduardo Marino**
> They have the knowledge, the World Food Program, then either could form an intent to equalize as part of the alliance of organizations who including the Central American Red Cross.

**[01:11:26] Eduardo Marino**
> The church is active on this, the Catholic Church in Central America.

**[01:11:32] Eduardo Marino**
> Then there are quite a number of organizations to form the alliance and to have the program and to fight.

**[01:11:46] Eduardo Marino**
> And instead of the dry corridor, that's why the title of this presentation is green, green the Pacific Coast of Central America.

**[01:12:01] Eduardo Marino**
> In one year, with community training, I think in one year, we can do it.

**[01:12:14] Eduardo Marino**
> We can stop the desertification and moving the face of greening.

**[01:12:23] Eduardo Marino**
> Well, that's it.

**[01:12:25] Eduardo Marino**
> Thank you.

**[01:12:33] Brian Krawitz**
> You're on mute, John.

**[01:12:35] Brian Krawitz**
> John, you got to unmute yourself, man.

**[01:12:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you very much.

**[01:12:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So listen, let me just say that was a brilliant presentation and brilliant situation of the current opportunity.

**[01:12:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're quite right.

**[01:12:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The landscape has just shifted and I want to thank you for identifying a way of

**[01:13:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> making the most of it, a way of using it as an opportunity rather than simply bewailing the disaster, in my view, of the current election.

**[01:13:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One of the challenges we have is that many of us, not least Eduardo Moreno, have got very grand visions for what the world needs to do.

**[01:13:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really do believe that this group does have the vision and the knowledge, which, if it were deployed, could really change the course.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm embarrassed to say these words, but change the course of human history.

**[01:13:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I really believe it.

**[01:13:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The challenge we have is, how do we make it happen?

**[01:13:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now, I should say that Eduardo has got a long history of making impossible things happen in the human rights area.

**[01:13:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will also say with all due respect that Eduardo is still only one man, and he's not hiking through the

**[01:14:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Sinai anymore because like me he's of a certain age.

**[01:14:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the question is whether there are ways we can do things together that Eduardo and others in our group can't do individually.

**[01:14:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think there are possibilities.

**[01:14:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Recognizing that we have only 40 minutes left in this meeting, I want to just give people a chance to put their cards on the table if they want to try to continue this discussion.

**[01:14:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I want to point out that at the last meeting Giselle from Gala gave a companion presentation to this one talking about the Latino movement of food workers and how they are actually a strategic force right now.

**[01:14:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle I think is already telegraphed that she has some ideas for how to build on what Eduardo has said and I'm going to invite other people to not fully explicate but build on

**[01:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on how we could contribute to what the challenge Eduardo has thrown down and then I think as ever the challenge is going to be how does a small group of us try to develop this into something actionable that's that's our challenge I think it's worth discussing it even if we fail to come up with something actionable but I think it is also our challenge and opportunity to try to make progress on our shared vision so I'm just going to jump to Giselle and then Ellie just because Giselle is is directly relevant hello everyone I'm sorry I don't have my camera on but uh I have a migraine but I jumped on but I want to specifically speak to this because we're doing a great deal of leeway in that space um we at gala are in direct conversation and sitting at the table of a plantrifinio the plantrifinio

**[01:16:00] Giselle Alers**
> Marino is the regional organization of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that is led by the vice presidents of those countries, exactly with this problematic that Mr.

**[01:16:13] Giselle Alers**
> Eduardo Marino is putting on the table.

**[01:16:15] Giselle Alers**
> In that space, we're working with the American states, OAS, we're also working with Winrock Foundation.

**[01:16:32] Giselle Alers**
> We're also working with San Morano University in Honduras that has now come into relationship directly, so much so.

**[01:16:42] Giselle Alers**
> On the subject matter, there's been conversations, as we speak, Gerardo now is in Honduras speaking to the minister of agro, Laura, to address this conversation.

**[01:16:56] Giselle Alers**
> So yes, there is a great deal of work that has been done.

**[01:17:00] Giselle Alers**
> there is a lot of work that is in conversations now because one of the other things that's happening, particularly to El Salvador, is that they import 80% of their food.

**[01:17:12] Giselle Alers**
> So we are on the ground with ICA, we're on the ground so much so that the small farmer to us's priority, we have now digitalized 16,000 farmers in the region to be able to create a strategic plan education of transitioning them into regenerative farming, but also yes as Mr.

**[01:17:35] Giselle Alers**
> Marino has said there's a great deal of coffee that is raised in that that is that is grown in that area and we're in conversations about diversifying that to be able to incorporate the food security conversation.

**[01:17:50] Giselle Alers**
> So I would like to continue the conversation with Mr.

**[01:17:54] Giselle Alers**
> Marino because of his interest and his knowledge and understand how his input

**[01:18:00] Giselle Alers**
> be gratefully embraced.

**[01:18:03] Giselle Alers**
> And yes, I think there is enough work that as a collective we can push forward together in a collective sharing of knowledge where this can be something that we can champion together.

**[01:18:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Terrific.

**[01:18:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Giselle, you're going to write directly to Eduardo.

**[01:18:23] Giselle Alers**
> I put my information on the chat.

**[01:18:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I gave him my email.

**[01:18:29] Giselle Alers**
> He can contact me directly there.

**[01:18:31] Giselle Alers**
> I could put my phone number also if anybody wants to by all means.

**[01:18:36] Giselle Alers**
> And we also have a huge platform that what we do, what I particularly do for Gala is on their UN presence.

**[01:18:45] Giselle Alers**
> So I'm on the ground.

**[01:18:46] Giselle Alers**
> That's why Salak comes into the conversation in this conversation with El Prantifino in the dry corridor.

**[01:18:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it extends across other spaces.

**[01:18:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Giselle.

**[01:18:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will be reaching out to you also.

**[01:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I hope that you will help us as the Eco-Restoration Alliance figure out how we can support and participate in this initiative also, as I said.

**[01:19:11] Giselle Alers**
> It's together, we're together strong.

**[01:19:16] Giselle Alers**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, you're next in line.

**[01:19:19] Ellie Young**
> Thank you.

**[01:19:20] Ellie Young**
> Yeah, so I think just for interest of time, I'll keep it very short.

**[01:19:25] Ellie Young**
> I would love to help make this a strategy that can be executed, especially at scale.

**[01:19:32] Ellie Young**
> And so I think maybe what we can do is double up the suggestion that John had for me to start a focus group, and we can actually maybe focus it on this topic, because software rotates around new use cases.

**[01:19:46] Ellie Young**
> And maybe I can organize a call with Giselle, Eduardo, Diana, John, and anyone else who's interested to contribute to see exactly

**[01:20:00] Ellie Young**
> what resources we have to make something like this happen and what steps would need to be pursued and then what sort of infrastructure would need to be in place to finally carry it out.

**[01:20:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's a great offer.

**[01:20:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Giselle, does that work for you?

**[01:20:16] Giselle Alers**
> Absolutely.

**[01:20:17] Giselle Alers**
> My email and my phone number is on the chat.

**[01:20:23] Giselle Alers**
> And once again, nobody can do this alone.

**[01:20:25] Giselle Alers**
> It's a huge endeavor.

**[01:20:29] Giselle Alers**
> The problem is so much more extensive than anybody can imagine and beyond the ground is where you really see the interaction and everything that comes from that.

**[01:20:42] Giselle Alers**
> It's not only water scarcity, it's not only food insecurity or it's also the social problematic and the justice of the facts.

**[01:20:53] Giselle Alers**
> It's about being hands-on and being able to be a collective to create the change we all want.

**[01:21:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's right.

**[01:21:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> frankly, the encouraging part of the current calamity is that those hundreds of millions of people are potential solvers of the existential climate and problem that we're here for.

**[01:21:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So there's potentially a way of leveraging this to actually address the even more existential problem of restoring the biosphere so that all of us can live long and prosper.

**[01:21:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Ellie, thank you so much for stepping up and finding a way to just make sure that these two very useful conversations won't die here.

**[01:21:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Before I give Brian a chance to give his long delayed presentation, I'm going to give Michael a chance to comment on this discussion, if possible, and Christopher.

**[01:21:58] Global Earth Repair**
> Hello, and so I

**[01:22:00] Global Earth Repair**
> I would just like to say very briefly, I am not a spoke person for the permaculture movement, but I am a part of the permaculture movement.

**[01:22:12] Global Earth Repair**
> And I would say that between the permaculture people in the world, we have solutions to all these problems on the ground, how to fix the water cycle, how to get food security and food sovereignty, how to rehydrate the landscape.

**[01:22:33] Global Earth Repair**
> We know how to do these things, so it's not a matter of that the knowledge isn't known.

**[01:22:40] Global Earth Repair**
> It's that the knowledge that exists needs to get to the places where it needs.

**[01:22:48] Global Earth Repair**
> And I can help facilitate that to some degree, but I would say that within every country in Central America, there are...

**[01:23:00] Global Earth Repair**
> permaculture people there that know how to fix these things and you need to find them and so i might be able to help but they are there permaculture i've been part of the movement for for 40 years and there we have practitioners in every country in the world and between all of us we have maybe one of the largest bodies of knowledge of how to fix things and grow food and grow forests of any movement in the world so i just encourage you to look for permaculture not everybody likes to use the word but we have a lot to offer so Eduardo i commend you on your search here and i will i i i guess i'll put my info in the chat

**[01:24:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Great, thank you.

**[01:24:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Christopher and then Brian.

**[01:24:04] Christopher Haines**
> Very short question on how do you make this project in Central America connect to the Panama now project, which you're doing also talking about restoration seems to me there's some connections.

**[01:24:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for saying that Eduardo reached out to me in this context because we've been consulting with them on the Panama problem.

**[01:24:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> To belabor the obvious although Eduardo was the one who had to point it out to me.

**[01:24:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone who's migrating on land from the United States from South America to the United States passes through Panama.

**[01:24:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Right for geographical obvious reasons or else they're in a boat near Panama bypassing the block just on land.

**[01:24:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> As Christopher knows we are trying to create a restoration lab to focus on the Panama canal on the water.

**[01:25:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we are trying to figure out how to point out that it is a strategic importance, not just because of shipping, not just because it could become an avenue of demonstrating impacts on climate, but also because it can address shipping security issues.

**[01:25:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as you point out, migration security issues.

**[01:25:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And so, yes, we should indeed try to figure out how to do that explicitly and not implicitly.

**[01:25:33] Christopher Haines**
> Eduardo's presentation was superb, so I just wonder if there's connections.

**[01:25:38] Christopher Haines**
> Absolutely.

**[01:25:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Help both of you.

**[01:25:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have a feeling Giusella is going to comment.

**[01:25:43] Giselle Alers**
> The benefit of Panama, there's also strong lines of Panama, but the benefit of Panama, which is a huge milestone, is that the educational level there when it comes to climate is huge.

**[01:26:00] Giselle Alers**
> it as the important it is.

**[01:26:01] Giselle Alers**
> They're not zero for a reason.

**[01:26:03] Giselle Alers**
> And the government of Panama has worked at it aggressively to be able.

**[01:26:09] Giselle Alers**
> So just to be able to speak and work in that air in that space, very different to the dry corridor.

**[01:26:16] Giselle Alers**
> The primary problem, in my opinion, for the dry corridor is the education component.

**[01:26:25] Giselle Alers**
> And you need to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:29] Giselle Alers**
> That's why there's so much work on the ground with ICA and all these organizations that can come in and European organizations that are regional agnostic to be able to educate to change behavior.

**[01:26:43] Giselle Alers**
> For example, one of the benefits that you have with PANFA is UNDP, the hub for Latin America, is in Panama City.

**[01:26:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very good.

**[01:26:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, this discussion will continue thanks to Ellie's facilitation.

**[01:27:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we will move on, but I would love to think that this is the beginning of a convergence and an action plan.

**[01:27:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We will try, we'll keep trying.

**[01:27:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Brian, you had a scheduled presentation, so this is your moment, but actually there are a number of people.

**[01:27:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are also a number of new member introductions, which we will accommodate at this meeting or at their next visit.

**[01:27:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So to put this delicately, don't feel obligated to fill all the remaining time.

**[01:27:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Let's give this perhaps 10 minutes.

**[01:27:38] Brian Krawitz**
> I will do my best being a Jew from New York.

**[01:27:41] Brian Krawitz**
> know Mitchell will understand this because we have a very commonality.

**[01:27:46] Brian Krawitz**
> know him pretty well from other meetings.

**[01:27:49] Brian Krawitz**
> Just wanted to thank you all for having me here.

**[01:27:52] Brian Krawitz**
> Thank you, John and Ananda inviting me.

**[01:27:54] Brian Krawitz**
> of course, Edward Muranabast for introducing me to this group who I'm working with.

**[01:28:00] Brian Krawitz**
> very important project.

**[01:28:02] Brian Krawitz**
> Me and Edward both talked about how we would present this project and it doesn't really need a large presentation slide deck or huge explanation.

**[01:28:11] Brian Krawitz**
> But I think the really important thing in this group is to explain the story of how it happened and how I got there and then some overview of things we're looking for and if there's any interest I'll put my information in the chat and people could reach out because I feel that there's always so much you could squeeze in a conversation and I could probably talk for 10 hours on this but I will limit it to like 10 minutes for my best.

**[01:28:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I started my whole life as a creative ever since I was a kid I can remember being a creative person.

**[01:28:48] Brian Krawitz**
> In the 70s I was the only person in the house being seven years old who knew how to use the VCR we had a RCA VHS VCR and not only did I understand how to use it I was also a very artistic

**[01:29:00] Brian Krawitz**
> person.

**[01:29:01] Brian Krawitz**
> And I guess kind of like a little bit of a loner.

**[01:29:04] Brian Krawitz**
> And even throughout high school, I didn't realize the gift my art teacher gave me by letting me have art as independent study.

**[01:29:11] Brian Krawitz**
> He gave that to me.

**[01:29:12] Brian Krawitz**
> I didn't even understand I was an artist, but he gave this thing to me.

**[01:29:16] Brian Krawitz**
> And I really want to reach out to him and try to find him to thank him for this because he had faith in me even though I had no faith in myself.

**[01:29:24] Brian Krawitz**
> it seemed like a lot of people even remembered me in my high school reunions.

**[01:29:28] Brian Krawitz**
> So after that, I was a little late doing my career.

**[01:29:34] Brian Krawitz**
> I decided to party in the New York Raves.

**[01:29:36] Brian Krawitz**
> And so that's kind of what really opened me up.

**[01:29:39] Brian Krawitz**
> My personality, know, electronic music.

**[01:29:41] Brian Krawitz**
> I found my tribe, my first tribe at least.

**[01:29:44] Brian Krawitz**
> And I began to kind of realize what how important community was.

**[01:29:48] Brian Krawitz**
> Community is that group of people who surround you who help open you up, who help you become who you are.

**[01:29:55] Brian Krawitz**
> mean, we all know who we are.

**[01:29:57] Brian Krawitz**
> The community kind of helps amplify and

**[01:30:00] Brian Krawitz**
> size, those important things.

**[01:30:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And then we realize and then we become that person.

**[01:30:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So this is kind of what the New York Grave scene did to me.

**[01:30:08] Brian Krawitz**
> And then of course, when I was 25, I was a little bit late in the game.

**[01:30:10] Brian Krawitz**
> got my first job in television with this guy, Mike Bloomberg.

**[01:30:14] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually asked him for the job.

**[01:30:15] Brian Krawitz**
> was a very funny story.

**[01:30:17] Brian Krawitz**
> But my first television career, the first job in television was for Bloomberg television.

**[01:30:23] Brian Krawitz**
> And I was a television operator.

**[01:30:25] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've done all different things, cameras, technical directing, editing, master control.

**[01:30:31] Brian Krawitz**
> And that kind of opened my eyes to like, wow, I'm a media person.

**[01:30:35] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, I moved on from there and came to California with my ex, Dia, an amazing woman from El Salvador.

**[01:30:43] Brian Krawitz**
> So I've had some experience in multicultural relationship and just being around different people.

**[01:30:52] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's so important because there's so many different people yet we're all the same.

**[01:30:55] Brian Krawitz**
> know, we all have feelings, we all have emotions, we all have anger, we all have happiness.

**[01:31:00] Brian Krawitz**
> Yes, and it's just like we all bleed, you know, so it's just so important for us all to be able to figure out how to work together.

**[01:31:09] Brian Krawitz**
> So when I moved to California, I was able to eventually move to San Francisco and get my second kind of important job.

**[01:31:19] Brian Krawitz**
> This guy, Al Gore, Al Gore started a television network called Current TV.

**[01:31:23] Brian Krawitz**
> I was a senior engineer there.

**[01:31:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So it enabled me to go from operations to engineering and work for two really important political characters.

**[01:31:34] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, I call them characters, because they were very interesting people, but open my eyes to what politics really is.

**[01:31:40] Brian Krawitz**
> at Current TV, I had a chance to learn about something called Burning Man, but that's a whole much longer story.

**[01:31:47] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been doing large-scale Burning Man art since 2010, including being one of the leads and helped design the temple on my first burn when I went there in 2010.

**[01:31:57] Brian Krawitz**
> For those who don't know Burning Man, I'd be happy to go over a long

**[01:32:00] Brian Krawitz**
> discussion with that because honestly that could take another 10 hours.

**[01:32:03] Brian Krawitz**
> So all these years I've been gathering all these different kind of experiences, all different communities.

**[01:32:08] Brian Krawitz**
> I started one of the largest industrial art collectives in North California, Oakland.

**[01:32:13] Brian Krawitz**
> I was going to just hit you up Russ because he's another Oaklander.

**[01:32:16] Brian Krawitz**
> I've been an Oakland for many years, big part of the art community and creative and tech community.

**[01:32:24] Brian Krawitz**
> From that moment, we had the pandemic and one really interesting thing in the pandemic is I realized we had to figure out a different way to communicate and we're doing it now actually the same way and this is so powerful.

**[01:32:37] Brian Krawitz**
> I actually became a virtual reality developer, more of a hobby and it's something I'm going to show real quick if we have a moment, something we're working on with the project I'm working on with Edward.

**[01:32:48] Brian Krawitz**
> But through all of these different things, I actually got a chance to really meet a lot of people, interesting people that are game changers and humanitarians and just really amazing souls and hearts.

**[01:33:00] Brian Krawitz**
> So, eventually, through all these networks, I met this amazing individual called Edward Munaba and I met him while here, where I currently am at a place called Heartland Collective, which is off-grid, 25-acre off-grid community, about a mile, about an hour from town, building what is the idea of what a sustainable community would be.

**[01:33:26] Brian Krawitz**
> So, I've had first-hand experience for the past two years, living in an off-grid community, discussing and trying to ideate and imagine all the different things that we're talking about in this meeting.

**[01:33:40] Brian Krawitz**
> And, you know, luck came to me, the beauty of luck, where I want to say synchronicity, by meeting Edward, with a project he's working on.

**[01:33:49] Brian Krawitz**
> And in the beginning, it was an introduction from Elizabeth Harald, the founder of the Water Unity Network, who's part of the ERA, and Edward was in one of her Zoom meetings for the Water...

**[01:34:00] Brian Krawitz**
> union network and he was Edward Edward was just looking to do some glamping because you know I have experience in these kind of ecotourism or ecotourism you might want to say just more about people coming to farms and visiting but giving the ability for these places to sustain so when I started talking to Edward it went from doing some glamping stuff to like wait a second we really know what we both need to do we started designing what Edward redesigning Edward is working on now Edward is Edward is a long a long time climate action person for 18 plus years he about eight years ago he started something called Edwards Hamlet in Jinja Uganda and the purpose of Edwards Hamlet is to help people who are in poverty learn critical skills which is the sustainable and organic and regenerative farming so then they can

**[01:35:00] Brian Krawitz**
> these skills to actually help better their lives but it's you know it's more than just learning how to be a farmer it's it's learning how to be a responsible farmer and then when I started talking to him about this I had this idea brewing in my head of a regen campus and I know regen campuses kind of exist there is a there's one here in California but the idea of the regen campus that we're discussing is a redevelopment of Edward's Hamlet into more of a educational center based on all regenerative practice but more than just learning a place where people actually do the work while they're learning in a place where other people can come for experimentation collaboration and one of the really interesting things that we're working on adding to that mix is a digital twin for educational and operational purposes and the idea of the digital twin is people can actually see what the place looks like before they go there and it gives people the ability to remote control anything digital

**[01:36:00] Brian Krawitz**
> on the property which can be really easily integrated.

**[01:36:05] Brian Krawitz**
> So if someone wanted to like check out what the sprinklers were doing or check out the solar array or do anything, you could actually do it remotely.

**[01:36:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So we plan on using all these digital technologies because I have experience in all of it.

**[01:36:17] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're actually in a discussion with someone who has created a really interesting platform.

**[01:36:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I can't really talk much about it, but one of the topics that came up was how do we all basically connect with each other and share all this information?

**[01:36:32] Brian Krawitz**
> Well this platform will do that.

**[01:36:33] Brian Krawitz**
> It's called the agricultural value chain network.

**[01:36:37] Brian Krawitz**
> And it's very similar to a platform.

**[01:36:40] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure if you all know what HYFA is and what the seeds platform is, the DAO, but it's very similar to that.

**[01:36:46] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'll be talking with them about how we take it from the agricultural value chain network to all that we could all kind of be a part of and share all this kind of beauty with.

**[01:37:00] Brian Krawitz**
> We're kind of we're in the development of all of that.

**[01:37:02] Brian Krawitz**
> And one of the things that I was going to call out for was I'm currently writing a white paper for what the Regen campus is and the paper is just a very long document with a bunch of challenges we face as earth and all the different things and how all regenerative practice can help solve those problems.

**[01:37:23] Brian Krawitz**
> So I'm going to put a call out to anyone who just wanted to maybe talk about it look at it.

**[01:37:27] Brian Krawitz**
> Anyone who wants to discuss how we can all connect as a group.

**[01:37:31] Brian Krawitz**
> This is what I've been doing my whole entire life.

**[01:37:34] Brian Krawitz**
> So I would be very happy to be on that call that gets organized because it's just something I've been doing since I can remember.

**[01:37:42] Brian Krawitz**
> And we're talking with a few different foundations right now, including the Aga Khan Foundation.

**[01:37:48] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm not sure who are you.

**[01:37:50] Brian Krawitz**
> If everyone is aware of who the Aga Khan Foundation is, it's just another group similar to the World Bank that helps organizations like this and countries who are in poverty.

**[01:38:00] Brian Krawitz**
> And of course, you know, places like Aga Khan and the World Bank, you know, they do have their reputations.

**[01:38:05] Brian Krawitz**
> But I'm looking at this in a very unique way where we have the opportunity to this more mainstream.

**[01:38:13] Brian Krawitz**
> And I think one of the problems we have or challenges we face as a group is we all know what we're doing.

**[01:38:18] Brian Krawitz**
> It's amazing.

**[01:38:19] Brian Krawitz**
> I can pretty much understand a lot of what's being said here, although I'm not a scientist.

**[01:38:24] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm more of a technology and creative nerd.

**[01:38:27] Brian Krawitz**
> But it's just like, how do we get the rest of the world to really understand this?

**[01:38:30] Brian Krawitz**
> And I'm sure people like, you know, Russ can understand this.

**[01:38:33] Brian Krawitz**
> How do we go to East Oakland and be like, Hey, we've got to make regeneration happy.

**[01:38:36] Brian Krawitz**
> You'll be like, what?

**[01:38:38] Brian Krawitz**
> And they'll pull a gun on me.

**[01:38:39] Brian Krawitz**
> don't know.

**[01:38:40] Brian Krawitz**
> Of course, that won't happen.

**[01:38:41] Brian Krawitz**
> But like, we have to really be careful about how we organize all this.

**[01:38:46] Brian Krawitz**
> You know, it's very important to organize it in a way for everyone to understand it, not just us.

**[01:38:53] Brian Krawitz**
> And this is kind of what my whole life has been about.

**[01:38:57] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm kind of a person who can be a chameleon and be an old

**[01:39:00] Brian Krawitz**
> different places, all the different peoples.

**[01:39:02] Brian Krawitz**
> It's just I like people.

**[01:39:03] Brian Krawitz**
> I don't mind going into these areas that some people are afraid to go into just because, you know, I'm just being very honest with myself and open and just there to help whatever I can.

**[01:39:12] Brian Krawitz**
> So I think really in the end of the day, Edwards Hamlet, the project we're working on right now, me and Edward, is more about creating a demonstration in Jinja, Uganda.

**[01:39:21] Brian Krawitz**
> I'm going to be having a conversation with a friend of mine in the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly a little bit later today about possibly doing something with Ghana.

**[01:39:30] Brian Krawitz**
> We've got some folks in Kenya who are working on this.

**[01:39:33] Brian Krawitz**
> Actually, the guy wrangling the virtual reality aspect of it.

**[01:39:36] Brian Krawitz**
> first university, virtual reality university Africa, Africa VR is going to be part of this.

**[01:39:42] Brian Krawitz**
> Brian, did I go too low?

**[01:39:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you for introducing yourselves.

**[01:39:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, Brian, it's very helpful, I'm reminded of your range of technical

**[01:40:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> expertise in enthusiasm.

**[01:40:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I have already demonstrated that I'm in great need of technical support.

**[01:40:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to offer your services, you know how to reach me.

**[01:40:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We could really use your skills and figure out.

**[01:40:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And by the way, the Aga Khan Foundation sounds like they might be an interesting group to approach together.

**[01:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm going to cut you off now, but I'm going to encourage you to continue the conversation with me.

**[01:40:28] Brian Krawitz**
> Excellent.

**[01:40:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right.

**[01:40:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so there are a number of people who came late, I think everyone who was expected to present has in fact presented, and they were all excellent.

**[01:40:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[01:40:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to invite people who haven't had a chance to introduce themselves or who were asked to promise to introduce themselves, to in fact raise their hand.

**[01:41:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> and provide brief self-introductions so that we can start under a one-week purgatory, which will end with your full-fledged membership in the restoration alliance.

**[01:41:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Diana.

**[01:41:20] Diana Doheny**
> Hello.

**[01:41:22] Diana Doheny**
> Thank you.

**[01:41:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Diana, who are you?

**[01:41:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why are you here?

**[01:41:27] Diana Doheny**
> How are we going to work together?

**[01:41:28] Diana Doheny**
> My name is Diana Dohini.

**[01:41:31] Diana Doheny**
> I live in the northeastern region of the United States in New Hampshire, out in the country.

**[01:41:38] Diana Doheny**
> However, most of my work over the past four years has focused on Africa.

**[01:41:46] Diana Doheny**
> So, I have several different business entities.

**[01:41:51] Diana Doheny**
> A for-profit entity is called Agroforestry Impact and Regeneration.

**[01:41:55] Diana Doheny**
> And with that entity, I have...

**[01:42:00] Diana Doheny**
> We've begun a program in Nigeria and I am currently working with several other organizations.

**[01:42:11] Diana Doheny**
> We are just working through our discussions and it's a large-scale regenerative agriculture program in Cross River State, Nigeria.

**[01:42:24] Diana Doheny**
> Working with Wildlife Conservation Society and EarthShot from the US.

**[01:42:31] Diana Doheny**
> So it involves regenerative agriculture, biochar, carbon market programs and a lot of other components.

**[01:42:43] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a holistic approach to looking at addressing deforestation and then food security and economic empowerment and community development.

**[01:42:54] Diana Doheny**
> I also have a non-profit entity called Amplify and it is

**[01:43:00] Diana Doheny**
> is 5e are the last two pieces to that and we have the privilege of working right now in Uganda with Colombo and his team Colombo is also on this call and together we have designed a program for biochar production and combining that with waste management infrastructure development and practices to create some organic compost that which they can then use to recharge the soil in base camp area for soil that has been dramatically depleted in nutrition and yield potential.

**[01:43:50] Diana Doheny**
> So it's a we are currently in the fundraising phase of this and hope to have that completed by January.

**[01:44:00] Diana Doheny**
> And I am also a part of several other programs.

**[01:44:07] Diana Doheny**
> I work with Hailing and Institute for Bamboo Entrepreneurship and Development, which is out of Anombra, Nigeria, and I'm also on the editorial board for the International Journal for Bamboo and Rattan.

**[01:44:23] Diana Doheny**
> So as you might guess, we have a big focus on the use of bamboo in Africa as a way to clean soil, mitigate erosion challenges, provide value add industry to communities, and other things.

**[01:44:42] Diana Doheny**
> part of our other component of our Amplify program is to also work on programs here in the United States and we're focused in our region in the Northeast.

**[01:44:52] Diana Doheny**
> And that is for empowering young females and women in the trades.

**[01:45:00] Diana Doheny**
> We have kind of a split focus and they may not seem related, but they all work together, so that's in a nutshell.

**[01:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a good nutshell.

**[01:45:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I just put in a note saying, if you're not aware, you should go to the Geoversity website and look at their pioneering work on bamboo architecture in the highlands of Panama.

**[01:45:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's really quite spectacular and there's a lot more to be done.

**[01:45:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Joanna.

**[01:45:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Victoria.

**[01:45:38] Jonathan Cloud**
> Yeah, hi.

**[01:45:41] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brian's presentation reminding me to let people know that there's a very sophisticated movement on the bioregional front, which most people probably are aware of, but it's a context that that will allow all of these specific solutions to be deployed.

**[01:46:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> or appropriate or Africa, whatever continent and all of them.

**[01:46:05] Jonathan Cloud**
> So right after this, we'll put in the chat the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:46:12] Jonathan Cloud**
> Joe Brewer is the convener of all of these.

**[01:46:17] Jonathan Cloud**
> Brewer and Penny Haipel.

**[01:46:19] Jonathan Cloud**
> And there are, you know, maybe dozens of bioregional learning centers, which will be a self-governing mechanism for bioregions and eco regions that's connected through bioregional earth.

**[01:46:33] Jonathan Cloud**
> So it's a, you know, kind of a master plan for getting citizens and, you know, every aspect of sustainability and regeneration, really coordinated with people doing what they can inside of a bioregional context and living in place and the value of I think people live in places that, you know, that is their allegiance, you know, when other things break down.

**[01:47:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> You know, particularly our political structures of nation states and all the way down in municipalities.

**[01:47:07] Jonathan Cloud**
> But this is a way to clean up rivers because you can't clean up rivers across political jurisdictions.

**[01:47:14] Jonathan Cloud**
> But when people feel unified inside of a bio region, which is flanked by natural barriers like mountains and rivers and climate systems and that kind of thing.

**[01:47:26] Jonathan Cloud**
> People can focus their efforts on learning about their land and sharing across bio regions as well.

**[01:47:32] Jonathan Cloud**
> So we'll put that link in for the design school for regenerating earth.

**[01:47:37] Jonathan Cloud**
> It's a $5 a month, $50 a year or scholarship.

**[01:47:42] Jonathan Cloud**
> don't want to block out anyone who wants to attend, but it's an incredibly rich place where you can get connected with people who are living in place.

**[01:47:53] Jonathan Cloud**
> And, you know, we'll need these people who are organizing it also understand all of this.

**[01:48:00] Jonathan Cloud**
> The logical breakthroughs that are happening.

**[01:48:01] Jonathan Cloud**
> I don't know that we've got them all integrated, but it's the social network that matters.

**[01:48:08] Jonathan Cloud**
> Thanks.

**[01:48:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We don't have them all integrated, but we're clearly working on it.

**[01:48:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:48:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Joe and Penny from the design school.

**[01:48:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We're going to be presenting today that they've rescheduled, but they are part of the network and we are working with them.

**[01:48:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Finding a way for all of us to understand the extent of the network that we have is a good topic to put on our infrastructure list because it's quite rich and it's quite broad.

**[01:48:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you don't know about it, you can't use it optimally.

**[01:48:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Speaking of our network, Paolo and Moses are going to introduce themselves briefly.

**[01:48:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Paolo.

**[01:48:49] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Thank you.

**[01:48:50] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm super happy to be here.

**[01:48:52] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I didn't manage to be at the beginning, but I already heard some fantastic things.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm Paolo.

**[01:48:59] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I'm very

**[01:49:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> is in Lisbon.

**[01:49:02] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I came to meet John by a dear friend and we had a lovely chat here in Lisbon on the thing that we are developing.

**[01:49:13] Paulo de Carvalho**
> Our angle on trying to contribute to address the challenges that we are faced with is the angle of understanding value and value force because we do think that that's relevant and we are developing a platform.

**[01:49:29] Paulo de Carvalho**
> won't go pretty much on that but we do believe that it can be a good contribution.

**[01:49:35] Paulo de Carvalho**
> In concrete we are using it around 34 municipalities in Portugal, in the center of Portugal, in an area that was particularly affected by fires and it's one of the consequences because the small water circuits were really massively disrupted as a consequence.

**[01:50:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> I do believe that there's a causality relation as far as we can understand it between that and everything that is going on in Spain and we are trying to make this not really just about nature regeneration which is substantially a big part of that and it's a big part of we ensuring our own survival but also taking a glance of the social aspects and how we can combine them all together and to make a difference and that's what we are trying to do with the platform but also with processes and people on the ground and basically creating a context for people through their stories to their active participation to the way that they see they help evolving on the right direction if we all start valuing what is really important for our life and I do like people and I do believe that fundamentally we value things that are

**[01:51:00] Paulo de Carvalho**
> The important ones for everyone's life and if we do that, I think that this would be a segue then to to unfold on the necessary actions and what we want to do as a platform is make the knowledge that we all have and this group in particular has available and at the reach of actions on the ground so how can we mediate this to make that knowledge available so I'm pretty much happy to be on the group and to engage in further conversations.

**[01:51:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Paolo.

**[01:51:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everybody's got a platform.

**[01:51:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you think your platform is something that should be related to the platform that Ellie is going to be talking about, please put your email into the chat or send it to her because I think it is time to revisit our platform conversation.

**[01:51:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Moses.

**[01:52:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute, Moses.

**[01:52:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Welcome to the club.

**[01:52:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Oh, sorry.

**[01:52:06] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Hi, John and Tim.

**[01:52:09] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to be here.

**[01:52:11] MOSES, GFCCA**

**[01:52:12] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm the founder and the CEO of Global Foundation for Climate Change Africa, GFCCA.

**[01:52:21] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Basically, we work with the small holder farmers in Kenya.

**[01:52:26] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm based in Kenya, by the way, the western region of Kenya.

**[01:52:30] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Currently, we have about a thousand farmers.

**[01:52:34] MOSES, GFCCA**
> We are working around regenerative agriculture and, of course, carbon removal initiatives.

**[01:52:42] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Our model, is called the forest farmland agroforestry model, helps in doing that.

**[01:52:49] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Of course, we do the basic training around regeneration for these farmers.

**[01:52:56] MOSES, GFCCA**
> It's been a while since it's been some time.

**[01:53:00] MOSES, GFCCA**
> in talking to John, and I wanted I was looking forward to meeting people here.

**[01:53:05] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Yes, and I'm happy.

**[01:53:07] MOSES, GFCCA**
> I'm so excited to listen in from the start to the end, and I'm sure I'll contribute more and more as we, you know, continue this conversation.

**[01:53:24] MOSES, GFCCA**
> Thank you, John.

**[01:53:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

**[00:24:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

**[00:25:00] Rob De Laet**
> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:00] Rob De Laet**
> notion that the healthy ecosystems create their own weather is still something that needs to sink in, but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle to fight climate change.

**[00:26:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I also wanted to call your attention.

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

**[00:27:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on an upper boat deck in the Zambia River behind the hotel is just to set the scene for you.

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the current Google State of green up to cool down.

**[00:32:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm afraid to look but I'm going to click the link.

**[00:32:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It'd be interesting to see if there was a spike.

**[00:32:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a natural transition.

**[00:34:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to put Hanukkah on the spot and ask her to introduce herself.

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**
> of certain AI or just other things that I find interesting that I bring up as that, please.

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you may not be hearing us, but it's a very rich, it's a very rich to that.

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:56:46] Christopher Haines**
> I can email it directly to people.

**[01:56:48] Christopher Haines**
> That's my only option.

**[01:56:51] Christopher Haines**
> It's still on a computer and a word document.

**[01:56:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can attach a word document and then post it to the forum if you don't have concerns about it.

**[00:01:30] JIM BLEDSOE**

> And it's, I don't know, it's like going

**[00:02:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And this Palestine and now this bridge, all the stuff that we've not been doing so that we can have the pocket dicks of the shareholders, it's just, we really need to reassess our priorities.

**[00:02:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, you know, that's what this whole group is about is reassessing priorities.

**[00:02:29] JIM BLEDSOE**
> However, there's some, there's, there's other ways of looking at that as well.

> And I, and Tony Renado, and several other ERA members were at in Africa a mere week or so ago.

**[00:07:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's possible.

**[00:07:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's approximately right.

**[00:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we've got a number of people to meet and a number of presentations as well, so that's how it's going to go.

**[00:08:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it being 906 and it being Wednesday March 27th, welcome to our bi-weekly town hall meeting back on our regular rotating schedule.

> In the agenda, we have notes on that meeting.

**[00:08:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's actually a very interesting meeting and neither Ananda or Jake, we're here, but I want to thank them again for doing the promotion, which I rarely do, getting such an interesting group of people.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> all together at the same time, and for the contributions that group made.

**[00:09:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then we actually got, I think, 38 responses to a post meeting questionnaire.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And in a little while, we're going to meet Annika Goyel, a new volunteer, native of does a fair amount of market research and is going to actually help us and work with a few other people, possibly including you, to try to distill the discussion and help us develop some recommendations of how to follow through on the really good suggestions that came in.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I want to notice that the bottom of the agenda, we have the recording and transcript notes and summaries from the last meeting, which is really worth watching if you weren't present.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> this was probably 20 of our African members talking about African opportunities challenges and challenges for us in how best to work with them and to learn from them and I actually had some some very good ideas that we'll be following up on there's a variety of materials including the yes indeed co-hole yes indeed including the the data as well as a chart and we're sort of putting together an analysis team Esten Magala who's running for the for the board it's going to play a role in that as is Hanukkah my voice is already failing so I'll let Annika say more when we get to her

**[00:11:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will turn now to Philip who will talk about our upcoming AGM annual general meeting during which we will elect for the first time aboard of directors.

**[00:11:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Diego, you're going to be presenting soon.

**[00:11:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you for that link, but you'll get to guide us through your, through your tour.

**[00:11:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Philip.

**[00:11:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

> Send to the irits.

**[00:11:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I don't think we've been on a Zoom together, but I've seen your name for years.

**[00:11:34] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> It's a pleasure to have you with us.

**[00:11:39] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yes, so the Eco Restoration Alliance came together in August of 2021 to enter the X Prize competition.

**[00:11:48] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> And some folks here present and others not present worked really hard to pull together the entry package, which was probably something unique.

**[00:12:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> You know, it's like akin to making sausage three times over in four dimensions.

**[00:12:04] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:13:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> allowed generally.

**[00:13:01] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Anyway, we've reached the point where the founding board members feel you know, we came together for the purposes of incorporation and filing the paperwork to achieve the file.

**[00:13:18] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We feel mature enough that the membership should have a chance to vote for who wants as its board of directors.

**[00:13:28] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The core team has been four people.

**[00:13:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We've decided to set the initial board size at seven people.

**[00:13:37] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The link in the document points to the bios of folks that have agreed that they will stand for being a candidate for the election.

**[00:13:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have seven or fewer than everybody's, I guess, automatically in.

**[00:13:53] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have more than seven, we're using a ranked choice voting system to sort of select

**[00:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone can make these meetings.

**[00:15:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll have a extended voting period where people can vote by email on the forum or I guess that will be the mechanism.

**[00:15:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we did discuss the notion that if people wish to vote anonymously or if they have concerns about the candidates for the process, they can of course use the forum.

**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Responding to the relevant messages about the election, or they can write to anyone who is on the steering committee or the board who they're comfortable talking to, and we'll just try to do that while respecting their desire to not And by forum, John is meaning the eco restoration alliance mailing list.

**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That is correct.

**[00:15:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Links to which are at the top of the agenda, as are many other useful links.

**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> especially useful for our new members.

**[00:16:07] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I see Ananda in her message specified, let us know by, or before the end of March, which is just a few days away, if you want to be a candidate.

**[00:16:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Are there any questions?

**[00:16:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will clarify any member in good standing and that this week it may not include all of the new people who are there, but by next week, assuming there are no objections, you too will be members in good standing.

**[00:16:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In principle, members in good standing can nominate themselves or somebody else.

**[00:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Probably good idea to get their consent to serve on the board and we are.

**[00:17:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Open because it's our first year and there's a lot to do that the board members will be willing and able to put in time on the steering committee as well as deal with the specifically legal and administrative issues that a board needs to deal with basically taking responsibility for what what we all do in the memberships name.

**[00:17:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions, comments, spontaneous nominations?

**[00:17:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, raise your hand.

**[00:17:44] Rob De Laet**
> I'm again.

**[00:17:46] Rob De Laet**
> Hello, everybody.

**[00:17:47] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, The one question I have is, can we review the mission statements again, because the one thing that I.

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**
> would love to see is that we become a talking apparatus instead of an action apparatus.

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

**[00:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> he in order to try to formulate really strong, clear mission and vision statements and a strategic plan, all of which would then be presented to the community for comment modification or ratification.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think we have a unique opportunity to try to put the story into action because we have so many of the world's significant players here.

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

**[00:24:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

**[00:25:00] Rob De Laet**
> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

> notion that the healthy ecosystems create their own weather is still something that needs to sink in, but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle to fight climate change.

**[00:26:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I also wanted to call your attention.

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

**[00:27:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on an upper boat deck in the Zambia River behind the hotel is just to set the scene for you.

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the current Google State of green up to cool down.

**[00:32:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm afraid to look but I'm going to click the link.

**[00:32:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It'd be interesting to see if there was a spike.

**[00:32:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a natural transition.

**[00:34:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to put Hanukkah on the spot and ask her to introduce herself.

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**

**[00:45:08] Devansh**

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will say hello to Cindy Irettes, but she prefers not to speak, not to speak, I believe.

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, I have come to understand you and bio for climate, um, help to bring to the non Australian world.

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**
> So yeah, my apologies.

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually, as far as I know, gotten through everything on the agenda.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We didn't do old timer introductions.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> Well, the guy that I thought I got to see like video of the thing happening, not live, but you know, later.

**[00:01:30] JIM BLEDSOE**
> But the engineer that was talking about that showed how there's telephone poles immediately around that, and there's these dolphins, they call them, they feed bumpers that keep things from getting things, and they showed places, other bridges that have things like that.

**[00:01:53] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And it's, I don't know, it's like going

**[00:02:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And this Palestine and now this bridge, all the stuff that we've not been doing so that we can have the pocket dicks of the shareholders, it's just, we really need to reassess our priorities.

**[00:02:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, you know, that's what this whole group is about is reassessing priorities.

**[00:02:29] JIM BLEDSOE**
> However, there's some, there's, there's other ways of looking at that as well.

**[00:02:33] JIM BLEDSOE**

**[00:07:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Rob is going to leave the report on the conference.

**[00:07:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I, and Tony Renado, and several other ERA members were at in Africa a mere week or so ago.

**[00:07:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's possible.

**[00:07:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's approximately right.

**[00:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we've got a number of people to meet and a number of presentations as well, so that's how it's going to go.

**[00:08:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it being 906 and it being Wednesday March 27th, welcome to our bi-weekly town hall meeting back on our regular rotating schedule.

**[00:08:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In the agenda, we have notes on that meeting.

**[00:08:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's actually a very interesting meeting and neither Ananda or Jake, we're here, but I want to thank them again for doing the promotion, which I rarely do, getting such an interesting group of people.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> all together at the same time, and for the contributions that group made.

**[00:09:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then we actually got, I think, 38 responses to a post meeting questionnaire.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And in a little while, we're going to meet Annika Goyel, a new volunteer, native of does a fair amount of market research and is going to actually help us and work with a few other people, possibly including you, to try to distill the discussion and help us develop some recommendations of how to follow through on the really good suggestions that came in.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I want to notice that the bottom of the agenda, we have the recording and transcript notes and summaries from the last meeting, which is really worth watching if you weren't present.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> this was probably 20 of our African members talking about African opportunities challenges and challenges for us in how best to work with them and to learn from them and I actually had some some very good ideas that we'll be following up on there's a variety of materials including the yes indeed co-hole yes indeed including the the data as well as a chart and we're sort of putting together an analysis team Esten Magala who's running for the for the board it's going to play a role in that as is Hanukkah my voice is already failing so I'll let Annika say more when we get to her

**[00:11:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will turn now to Philip who will talk about our upcoming AGM annual general meeting during which we will elect for the first time aboard of directors.

**[00:11:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Diego, you're going to be presenting soon.

**[00:11:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you for that link, but you'll get to guide us through your, through your tour.

**[00:11:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Philip.

**[00:11:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yeah, welcome everybody.

**[00:11:27] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> to see some familiar faces.

**[00:11:30] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Send to the irits.

**[00:11:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I don't think we've been on a Zoom together, but I've seen your name for years.

**[00:11:34] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> It's a pleasure to have you with us.

**[00:11:39] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yes, so the Eco Restoration Alliance came together in August of 2021 to enter the X Prize competition.

**[00:11:48] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> And some folks here present and others not present worked really hard to pull together the entry package, which was probably something unique.

**[00:12:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> You know, it's like akin to making sausage three times over in four dimensions.

**[00:12:04] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Anyway, it was quite a Way to project Since then The first year we were under the sponsorship My organization by a diverse your little climate and then about a year later Eco restoration alliance kind of sit up on its own feet.

**[00:13:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> allowed generally.

**[00:13:01] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Anyway, we've reached the point where the founding board members feel you know, we came together for the purposes of incorporation and filing the paperwork to achieve the file.

**[00:13:18] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We feel mature enough that the membership should have a chance to vote for who wants as its board of directors.

**[00:13:28] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The core team has been four people.

**[00:13:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We've decided to set the initial board size at seven people.

**[00:13:37] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The link in the document points to the bios of folks that have agreed that they will stand for being a candidate for the election.

**[00:13:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have seven or fewer than everybody's, I guess, automatically in.

**[00:13:53] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have more than seven, we're using a ranked choice voting system to sort of select

**[00:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone can make these meetings.

**[00:15:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll have a extended voting period where people can vote by email on the forum or I guess that will be the mechanism.

**[00:15:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we did discuss the notion that if people wish to vote anonymously or if they have concerns about the candidates for the process, they can of course use the forum.

**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Responding to the relevant messages about the election, or they can write to anyone who is on the steering committee or the board who they're comfortable talking to, and we'll just try to do that while respecting their desire to not And by forum, John is meaning the eco restoration alliance mailing list.

**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That is correct.

**[00:15:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Links to which are at the top of the agenda, as are many other useful links.

**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> especially useful for our new members.

**[00:16:07] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I see Ananda in her message specified, let us know by, or before the end of March, which is just a few days away, if you want to be a candidate.

**[00:16:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Are there any questions?

**[00:16:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will clarify any member in good standing and that this week it may not include all of the new people who are there, but by next week, assuming there are no objections, you too will be members in good standing.

**[00:16:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In principle, members in good standing can nominate themselves or somebody else.

**[00:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Probably good idea to get their consent to serve on the board and we are.

**[00:17:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Open because it's our first year and there's a lot to do that the board members will be willing and able to put in time on the steering committee as well as deal with the specifically legal and administrative issues that a board needs to deal with basically taking responsibility for what what we all do in the memberships name.

**[00:17:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions, comments, spontaneous nominations?

**[00:17:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, raise your hand.

**[00:17:44] Rob De Laet**
> I'm again.

**[00:17:46] Rob De Laet**
> Hello, everybody.

**[00:17:47] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, The one question I have is, can we review the mission statements again, because the one thing that I.

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**
> would love to see is that we become a talking apparatus instead of an action apparatus.

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

**[00:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> he in order to try to formulate really strong, clear mission and vision statements and a strategic plan, all of which would then be presented to the community for comment modification or ratification.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think we have a unique opportunity to try to put the story into action because we have so many of the world's significant players here.

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the current Google State of green up to cool down.

**[00:32:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm afraid to look but I'm going to click the link.

**[00:32:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It'd be interesting to see if there was a spike.

**[00:32:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> I'm going to put Hanukkah on the spot and ask her to introduce herself.

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**

**[00:45:00] Devansh**

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you may not be hearing us, but it's a very rich, it's a very rich to that.

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's really great that you're part of the network now.

**[01:53:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:53:05] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:53:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will say hello to Cindy Irettes, but she prefers not to speak, not to speak, I believe.

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, I have come to understand you and bio for climate, um, help to bring to the non Australian world.

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**
> So yeah, my apologies.

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's 1052.

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually, as far as I know, gotten through everything on the agenda.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We didn't do old timer introductions.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Although at this point, we've heard from Rob and me.

**[01:54:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And frankly, everybody but Michael Maya and Christopher.

**[01:54:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So if you guys have any comments or want to say hello or give us any updates.

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This would be your chance or in a worst case scenario.

**[01:55:04] Christopher Haines**
> actually get to go to sleep a few minutes earlier Okay, but listen, I'm I've just finished a rewrite of my greenhouse gas article As a story totally change the format And I'm now looking for comments on final edits and Suggestions on how to get how to get it published It's a story about how I figured out heat planet and the process that that unfolded Just to change the format and make it not a period you'd article that nobody was very interested in That's that's where I'm at From whom are you getting comments?

**[01:55:57] Christopher Haines**

**[01:56:08] Christopher Haines**
> Well, how many people want to do that?

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I understand.

**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, I get it.

**[01:56:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> And I'll let you know if I'm willing to go through the full 10,000 words.

**[01:56:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:56:46] Christopher Haines**
> I can email it directly to people.

**[01:56:48] Christopher Haines**
> That's my only option.

**[01:56:51] Christopher Haines**
> It's still on a computer and a word document.

**[01:56:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can attach a word document and then post it to the forum if you don't have concerns about it.

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:57:05] Christopher Haines**
> Whoa.

**[01:57:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:57:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I think that's just You'll soon be sure actually at the top of the agenda document Is a link to the forum and to all other things that new members should be aware of and since we have So many new members and interesting people.

**[01:57:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't see a link to the so-called forum online forum.

**[01:58:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:02:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And this Palestine and now this bridge, all the stuff that we've not been doing so that we can have the pocket dicks of the shareholders, it's just, we really need to reassess our priorities.

**[00:02:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, you know, that's what this whole group is about is reassessing priorities.

**[00:02:29] JIM BLEDSOE**
> However, there's some, there's, there's other ways of looking at that as well.

**[00:02:33] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So it's, I don't know.

**[00:02:42] JIM BLEDSOE**
> One thing at time.

**[00:02:58] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It could be a agenda.

**[00:03:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Hey, Russ.

**[00:03:29] Russ Speer**
> Hi everybody.

**[00:03:31] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Russ, how are we in?

**[00:03:34] Russ Speer**
> Well, thank you.

**[00:03:46] Russ Speer**
> Rob, you gained more beer than the last time I've ever saw you.

**[00:03:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute.

**[00:03:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've gained less.

**[00:04:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> That's volume.

**[00:04:06] Rob**
> I gained more beard and hair.

**[00:04:10] Russ Speer**
> That's my first stop tomorrow is, uh, barber.

**[00:04:15] Rob**
> Not a bad luck.

**[00:04:17] Rob**
> I'm just saying.

**[00:04:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so the timely people have arrived and now we wait two more people for the, uh,

**[00:05:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> Feel free to help with the note taking the recording of who's present.

**[00:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:05:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is anyone under as we think about the order in which we're going to go?

**[00:05:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is anyone under time pressure to abandon us meeting?

**[00:05:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a two hour meeting, so you'll be forgiven.

**[00:05:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:05:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**

> Can you hear that greeting now, Scott?

**[00:06:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Rob, you're still in India, right?

**[00:06:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:06:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:06:25] Rob De Laet**
> Well, it's not that bad.

**[00:06:26] Rob De Laet**
> It says 6.40 in the morning.

**[00:06:28] Russ Speer**
> Okay, so you're still waking up.

**[00:06:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You don't have to go first.

**[00:06:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You really want to go last.

**[00:06:34] Russ Speer**
> And cold.

**[00:06:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's all time week.

**[00:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Russ, you're producing a lot of wind noise.

**[00:06:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute you until you do.

**[00:06:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, there we go.

**[00:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> First frame, so nice.

**[00:07:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I'm, I'm, my voice is weak, I thought of cold.

**[00:07:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So fill up wondering if you can discuss the Board of Elections coming up item that we've got on the agenda.

**[00:07:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are links in the, in the agenda.

**[00:07:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Rob is going to leave the report on the conference.

**[00:07:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I, and Tony Renado, and several other ERA members were at in Africa a mere week or so ago.

**[00:07:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's possible.

**[00:07:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's approximately right.

**[00:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we've got a number of people to meet and a number of presentations as well, so that's how it's going to go.

**[00:08:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it being 906 and it being Wednesday March 27th, welcome to our bi-weekly town hall meeting back on our regular rotating schedule.

> The exception to which was two weeks ago, minus one day when we had our meeting in Africa.

**[00:08:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In the agenda, we have notes on that meeting.

**[00:08:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's actually a very interesting meeting and neither Ananda or Jake, we're here, but I want to thank them again for doing the promotion, which I rarely do, getting such an interesting group of people.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> all together at the same time, and for the contributions that group made.

**[00:09:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then we actually got, I think, 38 responses to a post meeting questionnaire.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And in a little while, we're going to meet Annika Goyel, a new volunteer, native of does a fair amount of market research and is going to actually help us and work with a few other people, possibly including you, to try to distill the discussion and help us develop some recommendations of how to follow through on the really good suggestions that came in.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I want to notice that the bottom of the agenda, we have the recording and transcript notes and summaries from the last meeting, which is really worth watching if you weren't present.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> this was probably 20 of our African members talking about African opportunities challenges and challenges for us in how best to work with them and to learn from them and I actually had some some very good ideas that we'll be following up on there's a variety of materials including the yes indeed co-hole yes indeed including the the data as well as a chart and we're sort of putting together an analysis team Esten Magala who's running for the for the board it's going to play a role in that as is Hanukkah my voice is already failing so I'll let Annika say more when we get to her

**[00:11:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you for that link, but you'll get to guide us through your, through your tour.

**[00:11:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Philip.

**[00:11:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yeah, welcome everybody.

> I don't think we've been on a Zoom together, but I've seen your name for years.

**[00:11:34] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> It's a pleasure to have you with us.

**[00:11:39] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yes, so the Eco Restoration Alliance came together in August of 2021 to enter the X Prize competition.

**[00:11:48] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> And some folks here present and others not present worked really hard to pull together the entry package, which was probably something unique.

**[00:12:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:13:01] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Anyway, we've reached the point where the founding board members feel you know, we came together for the purposes of incorporation and filing the paperwork to achieve the file.

**[00:13:18] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We feel mature enough that the membership should have a chance to vote for who wants as its board of directors.

**[00:13:28] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The core team has been four people.

**[00:13:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:13:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have seven or fewer than everybody's, I guess, automatically in.

**[00:13:53] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:15:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll have a extended voting period where people can vote by email on the forum or I guess that will be the mechanism.

**[00:15:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we did discuss the notion that if people wish to vote anonymously or if they have concerns about the candidates for the process, they can of course use the forum.

**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Responding to the relevant messages about the election, or they can write to anyone who is on the steering committee or the board who they're comfortable talking to, and we'll just try to do that while respecting their desire to not And by forum, John is meaning the eco restoration alliance mailing list.

**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That is correct.

**[00:15:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Links to which are at the top of the agenda, as are many other useful links.

**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:16:07] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:16:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will clarify any member in good standing and that this week it may not include all of the new people who are there, but by next week, assuming there are no objections, you too will be members in good standing.

**[00:16:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In principle, members in good standing can nominate themselves or somebody else.

**[00:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Probably good idea to get their consent to serve on the board and we are.

**[00:17:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Open because it's our first year and there's a lot to do that the board members will be willing and able to put in time on the steering committee as well as deal with the specifically legal and administrative issues that a board needs to deal with basically taking responsibility for what what we all do in the memberships name.

**[00:17:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions, comments, spontaneous nominations?

**[00:17:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:17:44] Rob De Laet**
> I'm again.

**[00:17:46] Rob De Laet**
> Hello, everybody.

**[00:17:47] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, The one question I have is, can we review the mission statements again, because the one thing that I.

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**
> would love to see is that we become a talking apparatus instead of an action apparatus.

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

**[00:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> he in order to try to formulate really strong, clear mission and vision statements and a strategic plan, all of which would then be presented to the community for comment modification or ratification.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think we have a unique opportunity to try to put the story into action because we have so many of the world's significant players here.

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the current Google State of green up to cool down.

**[00:32:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm afraid to look but I'm going to click the link.

**[00:32:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It'd be interesting to see if there was a spike.

**[00:32:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a natural transition.

**[00:34:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to put Hanukkah on the spot and ask her to introduce herself.

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**
> of certain AI or just other things that I find interesting that I bring up as that, please.

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you may not be hearing us, but it's a very rich, it's a very rich to that.

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's really great that you're part of the network now.

**[01:53:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:53:05] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:53:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will say hello to Cindy Irettes, but she prefers not to speak, not to speak, I believe.

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, I have come to understand you and bio for climate, um, help to bring to the non Australian world.

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**
> So yeah, my apologies.

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's 1052.

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually, as far as I know, gotten through everything on the agenda.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We didn't do old timer introductions.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Although at this point, we've heard from Rob and me.

**[01:54:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And frankly, everybody but Michael Maya and Christopher.

**[01:54:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So if you guys have any comments or want to say hello or give us any updates.

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This would be your chance or in a worst case scenario.

**[01:55:04] Christopher Haines**
> actually get to go to sleep a few minutes earlier Okay, but listen, I'm I've just finished a rewrite of my greenhouse gas article As a story totally change the format And I'm now looking for comments on final edits and Suggestions on how to get how to get it published It's a story about how I figured out heat planet and the process that that unfolded Just to change the format and make it not a period you'd article that nobody was very interested in That's that's where I'm at From whom are you getting comments?

**[01:55:57] Christopher Haines**
> Anybody that's willing to read it

**[01:56:00] Christopher Haines**
> 10,000 word article on that would like to take a look at.

**[01:56:08] Christopher Haines**
> Well, how many people want to do that?

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I understand.

**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, I get it.

**[01:56:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm willing to take a look at it.

**[01:56:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'll let you know if I'm willing to go through the full 10,000 words.

**[01:56:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I really would be interested in seeing it.

**[01:56:23] Devansh**

> Listen, why don't you?

**[01:56:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You could put a link to it into the forum.

**[01:56:36] Christopher Haines**
> There's no way to link it.

**[01:56:37] Devansh**
> It's not anywhere on a linkable.

**[01:56:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's the first thing.

**[01:56:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've got to decide how you want to share it.

**[01:56:44] Christopher Haines**
> The only way I can share it is emailing.

**[01:56:46] Christopher Haines**
> I can email it directly to people.

**[01:56:48] Christopher Haines**
> That's my only option.

**[01:56:51] Christopher Haines**
> It's still on a computer and a word document.

**[01:56:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can attach a word document and then post it to the forum if you don't have concerns about it.

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Being visible to the public.

**[01:57:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can show you how to do that.

**[01:57:04] Christopher Haines**
> It's pretty trivial.

**[01:57:05] Christopher Haines**
> Whoa.

**[01:57:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Or putting it out.

**[01:57:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:57:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for the update and anybody else.

**[01:57:26] Devansh**
> I'd be happy to read the article and give my feedback, but I'm not quite sure what the forum is.

**[01:57:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I think that's just You'll soon be sure actually at the top of the agenda document Is a link to the forum and to all other things that new members should be aware of and since we have So many new members and interesting people.

**[01:57:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to paste a link to that agenda again My forum John means the email list the Google

**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:58:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here you go.

**[01:58:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What do we call it?

**[01:58:13] Devansh**
> Well, some of them.

**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't see a link to the so-called forum online forum.

**[01:58:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There it is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:01:05] JIM BLEDSOE**
> The next, the next, Josh.

**[00:01:10] JIM BLEDSOE**
> I guess this crazy thing that happened yesterday with that bridge is, how about that?

**[00:01:19] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, the guy that I thought I got to see like video of the thing happening, not live, but you know, later.

**[00:01:30] JIM BLEDSOE**
> But the engineer that was talking about that showed how there's telephone poles immediately around that, and there's these dolphins, they call them, they feed bumpers that keep things from getting things, and they showed places, other bridges that have things like that.

**[00:01:53] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And it's, I don't know, it's like going

**[00:02:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And this Palestine and now this bridge, all the stuff that we've not been doing so that we can have the pocket dicks of the shareholders, it's just, we really need to reassess our priorities.

**[00:02:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, you know, that's what this whole group is about is reassessing priorities.

**[00:02:29] JIM BLEDSOE**
> However, there's some, there's, there's other ways of looking at that as well.

**[00:02:33] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So it's, I don't know.

**[00:02:42] JIM BLEDSOE**
> One thing at time.

**[00:02:58] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It could be a agenda.

**[00:03:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Hey, Russ.

**[00:03:29] Russ Speer**
> Hi everybody.

**[00:03:31] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Russ, how are we in?

**[00:03:34] Russ Speer**
> Well, thank you.

**[00:03:46] Russ Speer**
> Rob, you gained more beer than the last time I've ever saw you.

**[00:03:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute.

**[00:03:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've gained less.

**[00:04:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> That's volume.

**[00:04:06] Rob**
> I gained more beard and hair.

**[00:04:10] Russ Speer**
> That's my first stop tomorrow is, uh, barber.

**[00:04:15] Rob**
> Not a bad luck.

**[00:04:17] Rob**
> I'm just saying.

**[00:04:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so the timely people have arrived and now we wait two more people for the, uh,

**[00:05:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I put, and here it comes again, I put a link to the agenda document into the chat.

**[00:05:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Feel free to help with the note taking the recording of who's present.

**[00:05:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:05:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Is anyone under time pressure to abandon us meeting?

**[00:05:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a two hour meeting, so you'll be forgiven.

**[00:05:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:06:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, Rob, you're still in India, right?

**[00:06:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:06:25] Rob De Laet**

**[00:06:26] Rob De Laet**
> It says 6.40 in the morning.

**[00:06:28] Russ Speer**
> Okay, so you're still waking up.

**[00:06:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You don't have to go first.

**[00:06:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:06:34] Russ Speer**
> And cold.

**[00:06:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's all time week.

**[00:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Russ, you're producing a lot of wind noise.

**[00:06:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute you until you do.

**[00:06:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:07:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:07:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You know, I'm, I'm, my voice is weak, I thought of cold.

**[00:07:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So fill up wondering if you can discuss the Board of Elections coming up item that we've got on the agenda.

**[00:07:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are links in the, in the agenda.

**[00:07:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Rob is going to leave the report on the conference.

**[00:07:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I, and Tony Renado, and several other ERA members were at in Africa a mere week or so ago.

**[00:07:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's possible.

**[00:07:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's approximately right.

**[00:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we've got a number of people to meet and a number of presentations as well, so that's how it's going to go.

**[00:08:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it being 906 and it being Wednesday March 27th, welcome to our bi-weekly town hall meeting back on our regular rotating schedule.

**[00:08:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's actually a very interesting meeting and neither Ananda or Jake, we're here, but I want to thank them again for doing the promotion, which I rarely do, getting such an interesting group of people.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I want to notice that the bottom of the agenda, we have the recording and transcript notes and summaries from the last meeting, which is really worth watching if you weren't present.

> It's a pleasure to have you with us.

**[00:11:39] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yes, so the Eco Restoration Alliance came together in August of 2021 to enter the X Prize competition.

**[00:11:48] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> And some folks here present and others not present worked really hard to pull together the entry package, which was probably something unique.

**[00:13:01] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:15:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we did discuss the notion that if people wish to vote anonymously or if they have concerns about the candidates for the process, they can of course use the forum.

**[00:16:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In principle, members in good standing can nominate themselves or somebody else.

**[00:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> Open because it's our first year and there's a lot to do that the board members will be willing and able to put in time on the steering committee as well as deal with the specifically legal and administrative issues that a board needs to deal with basically taking responsibility for what what we all do in the memberships name.

**[00:17:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:17:47] Rob De Laet**

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

> he in order to try to formulate really strong, clear mission and vision statements and a strategic plan, all of which would then be presented to the community for comment modification or ratification.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think we have a unique opportunity to try to put the story into action because we have so many of the world's significant players here.

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

**[00:24:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a natural transition.

**[00:34:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to put Hanukkah on the spot and ask her to introduce herself.

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**
> of certain AI or just other things that I find interesting that I bring up as that, please.

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's really great that you're part of the network now.

**[01:53:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:53:05] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:53:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will say hello to Cindy Irettes, but she prefers not to speak, not to speak, I believe.

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, I have come to understand you and bio for climate, um, help to bring to the non Australian world.

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**
> So yeah, my apologies.

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's 1052.

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually, as far as I know, gotten through everything on the agenda.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We didn't do old timer introductions.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Although at this point, we've heard from Rob and me.

**[01:54:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And frankly, everybody but Michael Maya and Christopher.

**[01:54:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So if you guys have any comments or want to say hello or give us any updates.

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This would be your chance or in a worst case scenario.

**[01:55:04] Christopher Haines**
> actually get to go to sleep a few minutes earlier Okay, but listen, I'm I've just finished a rewrite of my greenhouse gas article As a story totally change the format And I'm now looking for comments on final edits and Suggestions on how to get how to get it published It's a story about how I figured out heat planet and the process that that unfolded Just to change the format and make it not a period you'd article that nobody was very interested in That's that's where I'm at From whom are you getting comments?

**[01:55:57] Christopher Haines**
> Anybody that's willing to read it

**[01:56:00] Christopher Haines**
> 10,000 word article on that would like to take a look at.

**[01:56:08] Christopher Haines**
> Well, how many people want to do that?

**[01:56:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I understand.

**[01:56:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, I get it.

**[01:56:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm willing to take a look at it.

**[01:56:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'll let you know if I'm willing to go through the full 10,000 words.

**[01:56:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I really would be interested in seeing it.

**[01:56:23] Devansh**
> Where can I find the article?

**[01:56:25] Christopher Haines**

> Listen, why don't you?

**[01:56:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You could put a link to it into the forum.

**[01:56:36] Christopher Haines**
> There's no way to link it.

**[01:56:37] Devansh**
> It's not anywhere on a linkable.

**[01:56:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, that's the first thing.

**[01:56:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've got to decide how you want to share it.

**[01:56:44] Christopher Haines**
> The only way I can share it is emailing.

**[01:56:46] Christopher Haines**
> I can email it directly to people.

**[01:56:48] Christopher Haines**
> That's my only option.

**[01:56:51] Christopher Haines**
> It's still on a computer and a word document.

**[01:56:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can attach a word document and then post it to the forum if you don't have concerns about it.

**[01:57:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Being visible to the public.

**[01:57:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I can show you how to do that.

**[01:57:04] Christopher Haines**
> It's pretty trivial.

**[01:57:05] Christopher Haines**
> Whoa.

**[01:57:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Or putting it out.

**[01:57:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Why don't you put a note in the forum saying I've written this article.

**[01:57:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> If you'd like to get a review copy reply to this message.

**[01:57:20] Christopher Haines**

**[01:57:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for the update and anybody else.

**[01:57:26] Devansh**
> I'd be happy to read the article and give my feedback, but I'm not quite sure what the forum is.

**[01:57:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I think that's just You'll soon be sure actually at the top of the agenda document Is a link to the forum and to all other things that new members should be aware of and since we have So many new members and interesting people.

**[01:57:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to paste a link to that agenda again My forum John means the email list the Google

**[01:58:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> the Google group and top of the directory.

**[01:58:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here you go.

**[01:58:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What do we call it?

**[01:58:13] Devansh**
> Well, some of them.

**[01:58:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't see a link to the so-called forum online forum.

**[01:58:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There it is.

**[01:58:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen as a parting gift.

**[01:58:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So as you can see right here, if you click on that link, you go to our online forum, aka the EcoRester Alliance Google group.

**[01:58:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All of you new and wonderful people who are joining us will be listed as members of the Alliance very soon.

**[01:58:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

```
**[00:01:10] JIM BLEDSOE**
> I guess this crazy thing that happened yesterday with that bridge is, how about that?

**[00:01:19] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, the guy that I thought I got to see like video of the thing happening, not live, but you know, later.

**[00:01:30] JIM BLEDSOE**
> But the engineer that was talking about that showed how there's telephone poles immediately around that, and there's these dolphins, they call them, they feed bumpers that keep things from getting things, and they showed places, other bridges that have things like that.

**[00:01:53] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And it's, I don't know, it's like going

**[00:02:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And this Palestine and now this bridge, all the stuff that we've not been doing so that we can have the pocket dicks of the shareholders, it's just, we really need to reassess our priorities.

**[00:02:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, you know, that's what this whole group is about is reassessing priorities.

**[00:02:29] JIM BLEDSOE**
> However, there's some, there's, there's other ways of looking at that as well.

**[00:02:33] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So it's, I don't know.

**[00:02:42] JIM BLEDSOE**
> One thing at time.

**[00:02:58] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It could be a agenda.

**[00:03:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Hey, Russ.

**[00:03:29] Russ Speer**
> Hi everybody.

**[00:03:31] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Russ, how are we in?

**[00:03:34] Russ Speer**
> Well, thank you.

**[00:03:46] Russ Speer**
> Rob, you gained more beer than the last time I've ever saw you.

**[00:03:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're on mute.

**[00:03:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've gained less.

**[00:04:00] JIM BLEDSOE**

**[00:04:06] Rob**
> I gained more beard and hair.

**[00:04:10] Russ Speer**
> That's my first stop tomorrow is, uh, barber.

**[00:04:15] Rob**
> Not a bad luck.

**[00:04:17] Rob**
> I'm just saying.

**[00:04:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, so the timely people have arrived and now we wait two more people for the, uh,

**[00:05:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:06:34] Russ Speer**
> And cold.

**[00:06:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's all time week.

**[00:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:07:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's approximately right.

**[00:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we've got a number of people to meet and a number of presentations as well, so that's how it's going to go.

**[00:08:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it being 906 and it being Wednesday March 27th, welcome to our bi-weekly town hall meeting back on our regular rotating schedule.

**[00:08:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> The exception to which was two weeks ago, minus one day when we had our meeting in Africa.

**[00:08:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In the agenda, we have notes on that meeting.

**[00:08:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's actually a very interesting meeting and neither Ananda or Jake, we're here, but I want to thank them again for doing the promotion, which I rarely do, getting such an interesting group of people.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> all together at the same time, and for the contributions that group made.

**[00:09:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then we actually got, I think, 38 responses to a post meeting questionnaire.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And in a little while, we're going to meet Annika Goyel, a new volunteer, native of does a fair amount of market research and is going to actually help us and work with a few other people, possibly including you, to try to distill the discussion and help us develop some recommendations of how to follow through on the really good suggestions that came in.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I want to notice that the bottom of the agenda, we have the recording and transcript notes and summaries from the last meeting, which is really worth watching if you weren't present.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> this was probably 20 of our African members talking about African opportunities challenges and challenges for us in how best to work with them and to learn from them and I actually had some some very good ideas that we'll be following up on there's a variety of materials including the yes indeed co-hole yes indeed including the the data as well as a chart and we're sort of putting together an analysis team Esten Magala who's running for the for the board it's going to play a role in that as is Hanukkah my voice is already failing so I'll let Annika say more when we get to her

**[00:11:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will turn now to Philip who will talk about our upcoming AGM annual general meeting during which we will elect for the first time aboard of directors.

**[00:11:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Diego, you're going to be presenting soon.

**[00:11:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you for that link, but you'll get to guide us through your, through your tour.

**[00:11:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Philip.

**[00:11:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yeah, welcome everybody.

**[00:11:27] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> to see some familiar faces.

**[00:11:30] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Send to the irits.

**[00:11:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I don't think we've been on a Zoom together, but I've seen your name for years.

**[00:11:34] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> It's a pleasure to have you with us.

**[00:11:39] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yes, so the Eco Restoration Alliance came together in August of 2021 to enter the X Prize competition.

**[00:11:48] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> And some folks here present and others not present worked really hard to pull together the entry package, which was probably something unique.

**[00:12:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> You know, it's like akin to making sausage three times over in four dimensions.

**[00:12:04] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:13:01] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Anyway, we've reached the point where the founding board members feel you know, we came together for the purposes of incorporation and filing the paperwork to achieve the file.

**[00:13:18] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We feel mature enough that the membership should have a chance to vote for who wants as its board of directors.

**[00:13:28] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The core team has been four people.

**[00:13:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We've decided to set the initial board size at seven people.

**[00:13:37] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The link in the document points to the bios of folks that have agreed that they will stand for being a candidate for the election.

**[00:13:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have seven or fewer than everybody's, I guess, automatically in.

**[00:13:53] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have more than seven, we're using a ranked choice voting system to sort of select

**[00:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone can make these meetings.

**[00:15:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll have a extended voting period where people can vote by email on the forum or I guess that will be the mechanism.

**[00:15:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we did discuss the notion that if people wish to vote anonymously or if they have concerns about the candidates for the process, they can of course use the forum.

**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Responding to the relevant messages about the election, or they can write to anyone who is on the steering committee or the board who they're comfortable talking to, and we'll just try to do that while respecting their desire to not And by forum, John is meaning the eco restoration alliance mailing list.

**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That is correct.

**[00:15:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Links to which are at the top of the agenda, as are many other useful links.

**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> especially useful for our new members.

**[00:16:07] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I see Ananda in her message specified, let us know by, or before the end of March, which is just a few days away, if you want to be a candidate.

**[00:16:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Are there any questions?

**[00:16:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will clarify any member in good standing and that this week it may not include all of the new people who are there, but by next week, assuming there are no objections, you too will be members in good standing.

**[00:16:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In principle, members in good standing can nominate themselves or somebody else.

**[00:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Probably good idea to get their consent to serve on the board and we are.

**[00:17:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Open because it's our first year and there's a lot to do that the board members will be willing and able to put in time on the steering committee as well as deal with the specifically legal and administrative issues that a board needs to deal with basically taking responsibility for what what we all do in the memberships name.

**[00:17:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions, comments, spontaneous nominations?

**[00:17:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, raise your hand.

**[00:17:44] Rob De Laet**
> I'm again.

**[00:17:46] Rob De Laet**
> Hello, everybody.

**[00:17:47] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, The one question I have is, can we review the mission statements again, because the one thing that I.

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**
> would love to see is that we become a talking apparatus instead of an action apparatus.

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

**[00:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> he in order to try to formulate really strong, clear mission and vision statements and a strategic plan, all of which would then be presented to the community for comment modification or ratification.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think we have a unique opportunity to try to put the story into action because we have so many of the world's significant players here.

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

**[00:24:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

**[00:25:00] Rob De Laet**
> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I also wanted to call your attention.

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

> on an upper boat deck in the Zambia River behind the hotel is just to set the scene for you.

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**
> of certain AI or just other things that I find interesting that I bring up as that, please.

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you may not be hearing us, but it's a very rich, it's a very rich to that.

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's really great that you're part of the network now.

**[01:53:04] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:53:05] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:53:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will say hello to Cindy Irettes, but she prefers not to speak, not to speak, I believe.

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, I have come to understand you and bio for climate, um, help to bring to the non Australian world.

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**
> So yeah, my apologies.

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So it's 1052.

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually, as far as I know, gotten through everything on the agenda.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We didn't do old timer introductions.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Although at this point, we've heard from Rob and me.

**[01:54:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And frankly, everybody but Michael Maya and Christopher.

**[01:54:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So if you guys have any comments or want to say hello or give us any updates.

**[01:55:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> But the engineer that was talking about that showed how there's telephone poles immediately around that, and there's these dolphins, they call them, they feed bumpers that keep things from getting things, and they showed places, other bridges that have things like that.

**[00:01:53] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And it's, I don't know, it's like going

**[00:02:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> And this Palestine and now this bridge, all the stuff that we've not been doing so that we can have the pocket dicks of the shareholders, it's just, we really need to reassess our priorities.

**[00:02:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, you know, that's what this whole group is about is reassessing priorities.

> And in a little while, we're going to meet Annika Goyel, a new volunteer, native of does a fair amount of market research and is going to actually help us and work with a few other people, possibly including you, to try to distill the discussion and help us develop some recommendations of how to follow through on the really good suggestions that came in.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I want to notice that the bottom of the agenda, we have the recording and transcript notes and summaries from the last meeting, which is really worth watching if you weren't present.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> this was probably 20 of our African members talking about African opportunities challenges and challenges for us in how best to work with them and to learn from them and I actually had some some very good ideas that we'll be following up on there's a variety of materials including the yes indeed co-hole yes indeed including the the data as well as a chart and we're sort of putting together an analysis team Esten Magala who's running for the for the board it's going to play a role in that as is Hanukkah my voice is already failing so I'll let Annika say more when we get to her

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

> on an upper boat deck in the Zambia River behind the hotel is just to set the scene for you.

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**
> of certain AI or just other things that I find interesting that I bring up as that, please.

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you may not be hearing us, but it's a very rich, it's a very rich to that.

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[00:16:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**

**[00:16:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will clarify any member in good standing and that this week it may not include all of the new people who are there, but by next week, assuming there are no objections, you too will be members in good standing.

**[00:16:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In principle, members in good standing can nominate themselves or somebody else.

**[00:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Probably good idea to get their consent to serve on the board and we are.

**[00:17:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Open because it's our first year and there's a lot to do that the board members will be willing and able to put in time on the steering committee as well as deal with the specifically legal and administrative issues that a board needs to deal with basically taking responsibility for what what we all do in the memberships name.

**[00:17:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions, comments, spontaneous nominations?

**[00:17:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, raise your hand.

**[00:17:44] Rob De Laet**
> I'm again.

**[00:17:46] Rob De Laet**
> Hello, everybody.

**[00:17:47] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, The one question I have is, can we review the mission statements again, because the one thing that I.

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**
> would love to see is that we become a talking apparatus instead of an action apparatus.

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

**[00:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> he in order to try to formulate really strong, clear mission and vision statements and a strategic plan, all of which would then be presented to the community for comment modification or ratification.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think we have a unique opportunity to try to put the story into action because we have so many of the world's significant players here.

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

**[00:24:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

**[00:25:00] Rob De Laet**
> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:00] Rob De Laet**
> notion that the healthy ecosystems create their own weather is still something that needs to sink in, but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle to fight climate change.

**[00:26:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I also wanted to call your attention.

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

**[00:27:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on an upper boat deck in the Zambia River behind the hotel is just to set the scene for you.

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the current Google State of green up to cool down.

**[00:32:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm afraid to look but I'm going to click the link.

**[00:32:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It'd be interesting to see if there was a spike.

**[00:32:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**
> of certain AI or just other things that I find interesting that I bring up as that, please.

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you may not be hearing us, but it's a very rich, it's a very rich to that.

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

**[00:24:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Do you remember the name of our workshop?

**[00:25:00] Rob De Laet**
> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:00] Rob De Laet**
> notion that the healthy ecosystems create their own weather is still something that needs to sink in, but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle to fight climate change.

**[00:26:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I also wanted to call your attention.

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

**[00:27:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> on an upper boat deck in the Zambia River behind the hotel is just to set the scene for you.

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the current Google State of green up to cool down.

**[00:32:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm afraid to look but I'm going to click the link.

**[00:32:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It'd be interesting to see if there was a spike.

**[00:32:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a natural transition.

**[00:34:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to put Hanukkah on the spot and ask her to introduce herself.

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**
> of certain AI or just other things that I find interesting that I bring up as that, please.

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you may not be hearing us, but it's a very rich, it's a very rich to that.

**[01:37:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost a lot of time, I would go.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:05] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:53:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will say hello to Cindy Irettes, but she prefers not to speak, not to speak, I believe.

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, I have come to understand you and bio for climate, um, help to bring to the non Australian world.

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**
> So yeah, my apologies.

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually, as far as I know, gotten through everything on the agenda.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We didn't do old timer introductions.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Although at this point, we've heard from Rob and me.

**[01:54:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And frankly, everybody but Michael Maya and Christopher.

**[01:54:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:02:21] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Well, you know, that's what this whole group is about is reassessing priorities.

**[00:02:29] JIM BLEDSOE**

> And I, and Tony Renado, and several other ERA members were at in Africa a mere week or so ago.

**[00:07:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's possible.

**[00:07:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's approximately right.

**[00:08:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then we've got a number of people to meet and a number of presentations as well, so that's how it's going to go.

**[00:08:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it being 906 and it being Wednesday March 27th, welcome to our bi-weekly town hall meeting back on our regular rotating schedule.

> In the agenda, we have notes on that meeting.

**[00:08:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's actually a very interesting meeting and neither Ananda or Jake, we're here, but I want to thank them again for doing the promotion, which I rarely do, getting such an interesting group of people.

**[00:09:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> all together at the same time, and for the contributions that group made.

**[00:09:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> then we actually got, I think, 38 responses to a post meeting questionnaire.

**[00:09:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And in a little while, we're going to meet Annika Goyel, a new volunteer, native of does a fair amount of market research and is going to actually help us and work with a few other people, possibly including you, to try to distill the discussion and help us develop some recommendations of how to follow through on the really good suggestions that came in.

**[00:09:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I want to notice that the bottom of the agenda, we have the recording and transcript notes and summaries from the last meeting, which is really worth watching if you weren't present.

**[00:10:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> this was probably 20 of our African members talking about African opportunities challenges and challenges for us in how best to work with them and to learn from them and I actually had some some very good ideas that we'll be following up on there's a variety of materials including the yes indeed co-hole yes indeed including the the data as well as a chart and we're sort of putting together an analysis team Esten Magala who's running for the for the board it's going to play a role in that as is Hanukkah my voice is already failing so I'll let Annika say more when we get to her

**[00:11:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I will turn now to Philip who will talk about our upcoming AGM annual general meeting during which we will elect for the first time aboard of directors.

**[00:11:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Diego, you're going to be presenting soon.

**[00:11:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you for that link, but you'll get to guide us through your, through your tour.

**[00:11:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, Philip.

**[00:11:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yeah, welcome everybody.

> Send to the irits.

**[00:11:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I don't think we've been on a Zoom together, but I've seen your name for years.

**[00:11:34] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> It's a pleasure to have you with us.

**[00:11:39] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Yes, so the Eco Restoration Alliance came together in August of 2021 to enter the X Prize competition.

**[00:11:48] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> And some folks here present and others not present worked really hard to pull together the entry package, which was probably something unique.

**[00:12:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> You know, it's like akin to making sausage three times over in four dimensions.

**[00:12:04] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Anyway, it was quite a Way to project Since then The first year we were under the sponsorship My organization by a diverse your little climate and then about a year later Eco restoration alliance kind of sit up on its own feet.

**[00:13:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> allowed generally.

**[00:13:01] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Anyway, we've reached the point where the founding board members feel you know, we came together for the purposes of incorporation and filing the paperwork to achieve the file.

**[00:13:18] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We feel mature enough that the membership should have a chance to vote for who wants as its board of directors.

**[00:13:28] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The core team has been four people.

**[00:13:31] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> We've decided to set the initial board size at seven people.

**[00:13:37] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> The link in the document points to the bios of folks that have agreed that they will stand for being a candidate for the election.

**[00:13:47] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have seven or fewer than everybody's, I guess, automatically in.

**[00:13:53] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> If we have more than seven, we're using a ranked choice voting system to sort of select

**[00:15:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Everyone can make these meetings.

**[00:15:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll have a extended voting period where people can vote by email on the forum or I guess that will be the mechanism.

**[00:15:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we did discuss the notion that if people wish to vote anonymously or if they have concerns about the candidates for the process, they can of course use the forum.

**[00:15:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Responding to the relevant messages about the election, or they can write to anyone who is on the steering committee or the board who they're comfortable talking to, and we'll just try to do that while respecting their desire to not And by forum, John is meaning the eco restoration alliance mailing list.

**[00:15:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That is correct.

**[00:15:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Links to which are at the top of the agenda, as are many other useful links.

**[00:16:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> especially useful for our new members.

**[00:16:07] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> I see Ananda in her message specified, let us know by, or before the end of March, which is just a few days away, if you want to be a candidate.

**[00:16:25] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Are there any questions?

**[00:16:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will clarify any member in good standing and that this week it may not include all of the new people who are there, but by next week, assuming there are no objections, you too will be members in good standing.

**[00:16:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> In principle, members in good standing can nominate themselves or somebody else.

**[00:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Probably good idea to get their consent to serve on the board and we are.

**[00:17:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Open because it's our first year and there's a lot to do that the board members will be willing and able to put in time on the steering committee as well as deal with the specifically legal and administrative issues that a board needs to deal with basically taking responsibility for what what we all do in the memberships name.

**[00:17:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions, comments, spontaneous nominations?

**[00:17:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[00:17:44] Rob De Laet**
> I'm again.

**[00:17:46] Rob De Laet**
> Hello, everybody.

**[00:17:47] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, The one question I have is, can we review the mission statements again, because the one thing that I.

**[00:18:00] Rob De Laet**
> would love to see is that we become a talking apparatus instead of an action apparatus.

**[00:18:11] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:18:16] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Interestingly, we do not have a board-approved mission or vision statement.

**[00:18:24] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There are things very close to that on the website which has been up for you know eight months or so and that has sort of become our de facto definition and it does by the way emphasize that a key goal is to make differences on the ground and increasingly that is our our MO is to try to make things happen in actual practice but the job of the board one of the jobs of the board is expected to be a strategic planning retreat possibly with a few outside facilities.

**[00:19:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> he in order to try to formulate really strong, clear mission and vision statements and a strategic plan, all of which would then be presented to the community for comment modification or ratification.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I'm with you.

**[00:19:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think there are a lot of organizations that have done quite a good job of telling the story.

**[00:19:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think we have a unique opportunity to try to put the story into action because we have so many of the world's significant players here.

**[00:19:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other questions or comments?

**[00:19:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Oh, okay.

**[00:19:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thanks Philip.

**[00:19:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was great.

**[00:19:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, since you've already opened your big mouth, you want to talk to us about the Zambia conference?

**[00:20:02] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, of course.

**[00:20:03] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:20:04] Rob De Laet**
> If my voice is a little horse, still it's because it's very early in the morning here, and I didn't have coffee.

**[00:20:12] Rob De Laet**
> Anyway, so John and I, and actually one or two other members of the Equal Restoration Alliance, for instance, like Arnaut from Farmtree, were present at the Zambia Conference of the Global Evergreening Alliance.

**[00:20:31] Rob De Laet**
> That's an alliance of, I think, several hundred organizations, with a lot of focus on Africa, which are all about social, ecological impact projects.

**[00:20:46] Rob De Laet**
> And a lot of people who were there, it's about five hundred of maybe three dozen or four dozen countries, were practitioners doing the real job on the

**[00:21:00] Rob De Laet**
> getting, especially with a lot of focus on transition to agroforestry, and it was a high-powered meeting in the sense that I think some of the most important practical change makers in the world were there, such as World Vision from led by Tony Renaldo.

**[00:21:22] Rob De Laet**
> They have been able to change millions of hectares of land from degraded to more green lands, just dig it, which were present with delegation, who have been doing in a fairly short time 400,000 hectares.

**[00:21:41] Rob De Laet**
> And so, and then there was the AFR 100 Commission that had a 100 million-hactor regeneration target.

**[00:21:53] Rob De Laet**
> The name of the conference was Accelerating Nature-based Solutions and

**[00:22:00] Rob De Laet**
> That was exactly what we were all trying to do is to club not only our projects together and get information on how things are done, but also to create a larger vision on how we can do it in such a way that it will change not the lives of individual villages or but whole regions, countries, and in the end, the world.

**[00:22:27] Rob De Laet**
> One of the things that there were a couple of ministers walking around, including Minister of Climate of Malawi, who I've talked to a couple of times, and actually because I had nothing better to do, I'll start talking to them about a project in Malawi.

**[00:22:44] Rob De Laet**
> And apart from that, I think what was important was that there is a slow change in focus from carbon to our story, which is the story of

**[00:23:00] Rob De Laet**
> I would say the living planet story that the way to repair the climate is by repairing the biology of the planet.

**[00:23:10] Rob De Laet**
> So I think that is slowly going in the direction.

**[00:23:14] Rob De Laet**
> Again what is always missing is enough finance and there has been a lot of talk about it and I think in a sense it seems that there are hundreds of organizations who are very to scale up except for the one thing that there are no resources out there that really want to connect to us while everybody says that they seem to exist but there apparently goes resources.

**[00:23:41] Rob De Laet**
> It was a very, I loved it a lot.

**[00:23:46] Rob De Laet**
> The thing with these meetings is always that A, everything important usually happens around and not at the conference so there was a lot of networking and B, now the proof is the push on.

**[00:24:00] Rob De Laet**
> to actually make the goal of accelerating nature-based solution as a way to to encounter climate change will actually happen.

**[00:24:12] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have a responsibility, at least John and I as two participants, but in fact everybody to make that happen.

**[00:24:19] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you.

**[00:24:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[00:24:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will add that the gradual change in the way people are thinking about restoration and the way in which the Global Evergreen Alliance, which organized this impressive conference is thinking and talking about it, is in part due to Rob.

**[00:24:40] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob shared a panel that I moderated and that he and Douglas Shiel presented at, in which we presented the living planet perspective.

**[00:24:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

> bring back the rains and if I can just say a few things about that you can always see that there's a lot of work done on water management once it has fallen and the funny thing is that almost nobody thinks about the step before how the hell did that rain get there and why did it get there and why sometimes doesn't go get there and there's clear there's a body of evidence and it's growing fast that forests make the rain and Douglas Shiel has actually a very good presentation that we might somehow we still need to make it send it around but it's only an MP4 now so we can't mail it which actually shows there's evidence that 70% of all rain on land is actually produced by the biology of the lands through the process of the evapotranspiration aerosols with cloud forming etc and somehow that

**[00:26:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I also wanted to call your attention.

**[00:26:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to share my screen for a moment to a couple of things.

**[00:26:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> One is, as incumbent and emerging members of the eco restoration alliance, I want to remind you of a few of your awesome responsibilities, one of which is to participate in the ERA's social media megaphone, Sally Armitage, media and communications person at Global Evergreen in the Alliance and the Alliance for the moderator for most of the four days of the conference had a session on communications at the

> on an upper boat deck in the Zambia River behind the hotel is just to set the scene for you.

**[00:27:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It was hot but it was cool and breezy and there was actually a good pride maybe 30 people sitting in a big circle trying to figure out sort of how to spread the word.

**[00:27:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm happy to say that I didn't dominate the conversation but I did get to trot out my cliche which is to say that we're building a movement together all of our organizations and what we need to do is learn how to sing the same song and the same key at the same time in multi-part harmony so that our message will be heard above the fray.

**[00:27:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A number of people picked up on that and by the end of the session we had adopted global evergreening alliances very nice slogan and hashtag green up to cool down as the common denominator message which I

**[00:28:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> really like because it doesn't talk about carbon, but it's not inconsistent with carbon.

**[00:28:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Sally followed up by producing a really nice graphic and all of the people, the 30-some people in organizations that were on the boat agreed to distribute that.

**[00:28:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's now going around with the hashtag and being redistributed.

**[00:28:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And it's a good thing, which brings me back to the awesome responsibilities of being an ERA member.

**[00:28:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> What we do ask our members to do is to subscribe to the Eco Restoration Alliance channel on whatever social media you're already occupying, LinkedIn or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook.

**[00:28:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And you'll find that our messages go out periodically.

**[00:28:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And your awesome responsibility is to notice them.

**[00:28:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you resonate with them

**[00:29:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Share them with your own social networks so that we can spread the word and potentially with your help and recommendation continue to recruit really interesting people.

**[00:29:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's the social media megaphone and now there's an attempt to broaden that to other organizations as well.

**[00:29:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That seems to be how we roll.

**[00:29:23] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When I went to Africa I was so impressed with the conference that Global Evergreen Alliance was putting together that I sort of had the feeling that they were going to be the organization around which the movement converged.

**[00:29:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That's less clear to me.

**[00:29:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They don't have the holistic view that we do although they've now asked Rob to give a presentation to their board about the whole issue of cooling.

**[00:29:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we're making real progress and Dennis was in the workshop and I tweaked him a lot.

**[00:29:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> He is opening keynote which was very powerful at a beautiful picture of Earth half covered by clouds and only to

**[00:30:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Talk about with carbon, even though all of the clouds over the forest were clearly shading the whole planet.

**[00:30:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we just keep on hammering that message and it's really important because as we tried to argue, it makes the work they're doing so much more important than it would otherwise be.

**[00:30:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And as Rob and Peter Bunyred's new paper has argued quantitatively, the cooling impacts probably dwarf the cooling impacts of the vapour transpiration and weather modification probably dwarf the impact of carbon sequestration.

**[00:30:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, you know, it's an uphill battle, but I think we're moving uphill, so that's a good thing.

**[00:30:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I don't believe there were recordings of the conference, but there are lots of good LinkedIn reports.

**[00:31:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> about events at the conference and we will try to repackage our workshop so that it can be distributed as well.

**[00:31:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any other, by the way, Tony Renato, another ERA member was there and Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration was a really important theme there.

**[00:31:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And indeed, his organization World Vision, with whom Robin and I are having follow-up collaborative meetings in a week or so, as well as global evergreening alliance, I've come to understand or particularly oriented around aiding smallholder farmers and agriculturalists in all of these regions, which is great.

**[00:31:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we hope we can get them to get even more support for that work by focusing on the eco-systemic and climate moderating effects of the great work that they're doing.

**[00:31:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, it's a movement with multiple

**[00:32:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> voices but we are attempting to get the message out in a ever more coherent fashion.

**[00:32:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Any questions or comments about this conference or this movement or what we're trying to do?

**[00:32:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Here's the current Google State of green up to cool down.

**[00:32:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm afraid to look but I'm going to click the link.

**[00:32:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:32:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It'd be interesting to see if there was a spike.

**[00:32:38] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> They introduced the concept in 2019 Global Evergreen Alliance and then we sort of did a blast just yesterday the day before.

**[00:32:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to reflect the message and to think about other ways of getting it out there.

**[00:33:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:33:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, there you go.

**[00:33:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, the background issues are, if you'd like to work with Onika and Esten and me and I think Rochelle and Cindy on distilling and analyzing the feedback from the Africa conference, let us know.

**[00:33:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think Onika is going to be the point person for that.

**[00:33:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's not too late to nominate a person, perhaps yourself, for the Board of Directors Meeting, and make sure you're subscribed to our various channels and green up to cool down.

**[00:33:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And with that, we can move on to the fun part, which is to meet some of our new members.

**[00:33:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And since

**[00:34:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a natural transition.

**[00:34:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to put Hanukkah on the spot and ask her to introduce herself.

**[00:34:07] Anekha Goyal**
> Hi, everyone.

**[00:34:08] Anekha Goyal**
> Nice to meet you all.

**[00:34:09] Anekha Goyal**
> My name is Annika.

**[00:34:11] Anekha Goyal**
> John asked me to make a slide, so I'm just going to share my screen really quick.

**[00:34:19] Anekha Goyal**
> All right, there it is.

**[00:34:22] Anekha Goyal**
> So I'll quickly introduce myself.

**[00:34:24] Anekha Goyal**
> I am based out of New York, as John mentioned, and I'm from New Jersey, so not not a big leap over there.

**[00:34:31] Anekha Goyal**
> based in the Chinese state area and I've been here my entire life, and I currently work as a business consultant.

**[00:34:37] Anekha Goyal**
> While I was a student at Cornell a couple years ago, I was the director of our university sustainable design organization.

**[00:34:46] Anekha Goyal**
> I oversaw over 100 students and like over 12 projects that were focused on local to global sustainable design initiatives.

**[00:34:56] Anekha Goyal**
> So it was through that organization that I had the opportunity to manage.

**[00:35:00] Anekha Goyal**
> an urban land restoration project, which sparked my interest in working in this field at a professional capacity.

**[00:35:07] Anekha Goyal**
> And that's really what I'm looking to do now.

**[00:35:10] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm trying to get back in the game.

**[00:35:11] Anekha Goyal**
> I'm taking coursework under Dr.

**[00:35:14] Anekha Goyal**
> Andrew Millison, who I believe some of you might know where that work was in the past.

**[00:35:19] Anekha Goyal**
> As John mentioned, I'm assisting the ERA with data analysis and internal stakeholder management, so you'll be seeing me around.

**[00:35:28] Anekha Goyal**
> I don't think I'll be running for it as little might have mentioned.

**[00:35:32] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll leave that to the experts and to all of you, but I will be here to support and administrative and analysis capacity.

**[00:35:40] Anekha Goyal**
> But just a little bit about where I'm at right now, I'm just really looking to supplement my book knowledge and my experience in business operations and management with hands-on technical work.

**[00:35:50] Anekha Goyal**
> If anyone has ongoing projects and you're looking for hands, I'd love to get in touch and talk about where I can help.

**[00:35:59] Anekha Goyal**
> I'll give more

**[00:36:00] Anekha Goyal**
> Details here get the chance to connect, but I'm open to relocating and do something a bit self-funded because for me It's just really important to get this on the ground knowledge now And if anyone was ever where I am kind of in the beginning of the career Trying to find where they fit into this field and fit into this work and that's 30 minutes where they'd like to chat about your experiences I'd also appreciate that as well.

**[00:36:23] Anekha Goyal**
> I've really enjoyed meeting John Philip Maya and some other people Familiar faces and I'd love to meet more just to see where I can best play a role in this really important work So nice to meet you all.

**[00:36:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thanks for having me and I'll turn it over to whoever's next Well, I want to reinforce couple of things on the cassette.

**[00:36:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've known her For all of a week.

**[00:36:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I met her the other day in New York City.

**[00:36:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> were sitting in a coffee shop and She found her way to us by the way of Maya and Anika.

**[00:36:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm very impressed and I just want to make sure you heard her say

**[00:37:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When she says she's looking for technical, hands-on experience, she means working with the land with people who really know how to do that, and she's willing to travel, so she's just a really great opportunity.

**[00:37:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to take as much of her expertise and time as I can, but we're a volunteer organization, so I've also promised her that I would do anything I could to help her get up to speed for her own project, which she actually hopes to be a school-based restoration project in Freehold, New Jersey, once she feels she's got the skills, so I'm really, really happy to have her on board.

**[00:37:40] Anekha Goyal**
> Thanks, John.

**[00:37:41] Anekha Goyal**
> the keywords here are free labor.

**[00:37:44] Anekha Goyal**
> Eventually, like John mentioned, I do want to do community-driven work.

**[00:37:49] Anekha Goyal**
> My hometown has a really large migrant population, and the schools that my town neighbors are quite underfunded, and they have a lot of land, and it'd be great to be

**[00:38:00] Anekha Goyal**
> do a restoration work there in a way that really benefits the kids as well, but I want to make sure I have experience and knowledge of the land before I do that and looking forward to gaining that.

**[00:38:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cool, hands have gone up.

**[00:38:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, Jim.

**[00:38:17] JIM BLEDSOE**
> When you say school, are you referring to children or college?

**[00:38:23] JIM BLEDSOE**
> level of school are you talking about?

**[00:38:25] Anekha Goyal**
> Um, like 12 to 18, so middle school to high school.

**[00:38:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And Cole, welcome.

**[00:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> How nice to see you.

**[00:38:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole was was actually in my number two for the first year of the year of a restoration alliance courtesy of biodiversity for a livable climate and we haven't been same since he left, but your hand is up Cole.

**[00:38:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You probably did not raise it so I would talk about you, but you had a question to ask.

**[00:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But we can't hear you.

**[00:39:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:39:11] Cole**
> Can you hear me now?

**[00:39:14] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, sir.

**[00:39:15] Cole**
> Perfect.

**[00:39:16] Cole**
> I just had a quick recommendation.

**[00:39:18] Cole**
> Sometime last year, we were talking about expanding the Miyawaki forest initiative.

**[00:39:26] Cole**
> And someone, I'm forgetting names and I'm forgetting titles, recommended pairing with schools and doing a Miyawaki forest with a lot of accessory gardens around it set up in an educational format.

**[00:39:42] Cole**
> I remember there being die gardens.

**[00:39:44] Cole**
> remember there being permaculture gardens for food and things like that.

**[00:39:49] Cole**
> I'm kicking myself not remembering it, but if I can pull it up during this meeting, I'll send you the link.

**[00:39:54] Cole**
> It was an excellent presentation and it was something I was very motivated towards and it would be

**[00:40:00] Cole**
> great to see someone actually put this in place, especially in the US and then New Jersey.

**[00:40:06] Cole**
> But if anybody else remembers the name of that project or what the plans were, there was a PDF going around.

**[00:40:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, you're referring to Eric Schneider.

**[00:40:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That was living landscapes project, which with his collaboration, I incorporated into a proposal.

**[00:40:22] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> still trying to sell here in Rochester.

**[00:40:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But if you take a look at that link on it, I don't think I sent this to you previously.

**[00:40:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You'll see a school-based proposal and on the fourth page, there is a picture that says living planet learnscape.

**[00:40:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And if you click on the click to view button, you can actually see Eric's really stunning expansion of the Miyawaki Multiversity notion into something that actually is a really good idea.

**[00:40:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you.

**[00:41:01] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, thanks, Anika.

**[00:41:05] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I was in the coffee shop with Anika, and I realized I had another meeting coming up.

**[00:41:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I said, Oh, Anika, wait a minute, the meeting is going to be right here, but you're welcome to stay.

**[00:41:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then the guy sitting in the table right next to us said, that would be me.

**[00:41:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So, Devanche had sort of somehow emerged in the coffee shop during my conversation with Anika.

**[00:41:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Devanche also found us through the internet.

**[00:41:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have a shared history back at RIT at some point, but I'm going to ask him to introduce him next, because I've told the story in sequence.

**[00:41:44] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Quickly intervene here, I think one of the things I'm learning is we kind of learned to honor different cultures and backgrounds and voices to learn to pronounce people's names correctly.

**[00:41:58] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> So I believe Anika.

**[00:42:00] Philip Bogdonoff, Bio4Climate.org**
> Is how you pronounce your name?

**[00:42:02] Anekha Goyal**
> that correct?

**[00:42:03] Anekha Goyal**
> Uh, it's an eka, but yeah, I I respond to most variation so I'm very patient with that all good.

**[00:42:10] Devansh**
> Thanks, bill And the lunch Good enough, uh so Good as I was saying good evening everybody I I reached out to john Primarily as a writer.

**[00:42:31] Devansh**
> have about 200,000 readers a week mostly in the senior tech leadership and when check after investor spaces and I wanted to give Climate is something that's a personal interest to me because of family and Other circumstances, so I wanted to give john a space where you could come on talk about the work you guys were doing and Hopefully get some attention

**[00:43:00] Devansh**
> and resources directed towards that.

**[00:43:03] Devansh**
> As John and I spoke both well into that night and also in the more morning today.

**[00:43:12] Devansh**
> I think we've identified few cases where we will be taking forward projects with identified places that we can use as a bid to raise resources.

**[00:43:25] Devansh**
> So far our work will start up.

**[00:43:28] Devansh**
> So I've had them raise over $15 million in capital funding.

**[00:43:33] Devansh**
> So we'll be hoping to do something similar with you guys.

**[00:43:37] Devansh**
> The goal there will be to use some of the on the ground work you guys have been doing as a way to collect resources, test hypotheses, push things out and then build products on top of that and to be able to scale that out to larger audiences.

**[00:43:56] Devansh**
> I will be currently in New York.

**[00:43:58] Devansh**
> That's where I

**[00:44:00] Devansh**
> a look at myself being for the next few months, which is longer than I've spent in any place in my life.

**[00:44:06] Devansh**
> So I'm pretty excited.

**[00:44:09] Devansh**
> If any of you are around, I'd love to meet you.

**[00:44:12] Devansh**
> I'm setting up a few meetups within my readers and community.

**[00:44:16] Devansh**
> So I'd be happy to have you there.

**[00:44:20] Devansh**
> And yes, Rob, let me link to that.

**[00:44:23] Devansh**
> So if you just Google my name and machine learning, the whole thing first page is mostly me.

**[00:44:31] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I currently focus with.

**[00:44:38] Devansh**
> This is my primary publication that I focus on currently.

**[00:44:42] Devansh**
> Stakes up most of my time.

**[00:44:46] Devansh**
> It's essentially me breaking down both technical, AI research, but also the market dynamics, social issues that you get, such as unfair externalization of negative with possible

**[00:45:00] Devansh**

**[00:45:08] Devansh**
> Any questions?

**[00:45:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, so needless to say, I'm talking to Demontia about how to make the AI oracle of eco-restoration the channel and facilitator of shared knowledge and interactions among ourselves and the big, wide world that would benefit from amplification of that sort.

**[00:45:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I also sent him today, Rob, one of your articles on the Digital Gaia concept, so we'll see where it goes.

**[00:45:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> had a professor in graduate school who used to say when he had an old claim, like I've raised $15 million and I'm going to raise a lot of money for you.

**[00:45:54] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> say, very interesting, interesting, if true, interesting, in any case.

**[00:46:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And that's the way I feel about Devant, so I think that he's got a great deal to offer, it's going to be a very interesting collaboration as we see how it shapes up.

**[00:46:07] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So thank you, Devant.

**[00:46:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we don't have your email, but people can reach out to you directly, either through me or through...

**[00:46:19] Devansh**
> Yeah.

**[00:46:20] Devansh**
> So let me link my link in as far as publications.

**[00:46:23] Devansh**
> Yeah, my publications are all open by that information so that anybody can reach out.

**[00:46:29] Devansh**
> I'll also drop my LinkedIn in the chat.

**[00:46:32] Devansh**
> Just one thing, I'm not quite sure why LinkedIn does this, but it makes people follow me and not send connection requests.

**[00:46:42] Devansh**
> So just make sure you do the connect.

**[00:46:45] Devansh**
> You hit connect instead of follow, because that happens.

**[00:46:50] Devansh**
> And Rob, about your digital guy, this thing, that was an idea.

**[00:46:56] Devansh**
> I'd propose to John a very tamed-down idea.

**[00:47:00] Devansh**
> a variant of that which was just forecasting based on certain impacts because I've been researching chaotic systems recently.

**[00:47:07] Devansh**
> So I guess great minds think alike.

**[00:47:09] Devansh**
> I will be speaking to some very interesting people in the high-performance computing space, actually tomorrow, who have been doing some work in forecasting climate.

**[00:47:22] Devansh**
> So I'd love to have you possibly be able to speak to you before then get your insights so that I can have a more informed conversation with those guys.

**[00:47:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Rob, I think that the launch might be what we need in order to help the farm tree people scale up and productize what they're doing.

**[00:47:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've told them about it, it thinks it's a natural so good conversation to have.

**[00:47:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Your hand is up, your microphone is muted.

**[00:47:57] Rob De Laet**
> Yes, that's wonderful.

**[00:48:00] Rob De Laet**
> Thank you, I think it's okay, just we're in a very urgent situation and the one tool that is absolutely needed is a digital twin of all kinds of processes live processes on this planet and to organize actually millions of projects in such a huge digital sphere.

**[00:48:23] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you about it because that would be the one tool set that could support the regeneration of the biology of the planet.

**[00:48:33] Rob De Laet**
> And I think we have to use AI as one of the things to scale up speed up these processes.

**[00:48:42] Rob De Laet**
> So I'd love to talk to you ASAP.

**[00:48:44] Devansh**
> Thank you.

**[00:48:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I didn't mention to you that Rob is also in touch with the group at CERN working on a related project, but especially with your participation, they might be an interesting group to recruit.

**[00:49:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'll leave it to you guys to get together, but if you want to bring me in on the conversation, I can't resist that kind of thing.

**[00:49:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[00:49:10] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So this is how it happens.

**[00:49:12] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It turns out that we're sort of an interesting group for making connections.

**[00:49:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I think that's an important one of our functions.

**[00:49:20] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we have a number of people more to meet.

**[00:49:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I'm going to go not in order if that's okay with Dave towards the end.

**[00:49:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So that people who've been in the queue for a while can get their due respect.

**[00:49:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So the next person would be Nabil pronounced, I believe, Nabil from vetiver without borders.

**[00:49:55] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Who's going to tell us about his work.

**[00:50:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You've seen him here once or twice before, but this is his chance to tell a story, I believe.

**[00:50:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Hey, thank you, John.

**[00:50:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> mean, to me, it's important to try.

**[00:50:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I mean, it's pronounced near Bill, but English people, you know, they try their best and we really commend them for it.

**[00:50:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, thank you for even the opportunity.

**[00:50:22] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so, I've been a farmer for 10 years.

**[00:50:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been doing different stuff.

**[00:50:30] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a neighbor of Ananda, which is on this alliance.

**[00:50:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I've met you before, I knew Ananda was part of this.

**[00:50:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's a lucky coincidence, but I've been farming for a lot of years.

**[00:50:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I am today a data analyst.

**[00:50:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I also worked part-time as a data engineer.

**[00:50:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And with data science team, but that's not what I'm here.

**[00:50:59] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And I

**[00:51:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to get about this time about me and Russ told me that it would be a great opportunity to talk to this group about the vetiver system.

**[00:51:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I don't want to talk about our organization as well.

**[00:51:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's really for you to keep in mind that vetiver is a solution that can be adapted in many of the different projects that you guys are promoting at the point.

**[00:51:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So I hope you can see my screen and let's go and discover the vetiver system together.

**[00:51:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A lot of you have a lot of knowledge of different restoration techniques, so I might go really quick on some principles, but I want to cover the basics so that everybody understands the benefits of a vetiver.

**[00:52:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and so what's really important to know first about better better system is that it uses better grass which is a grass originated from India but the system has really been developed by Thai agronomists in the 80s and it's been promoted mostly by the late king of Thailand who basically wanted to provide his people especially in the north in the ishan and the poorest area and easy to to regenerate their land so that they can be way more resilient to the harsh climate of northern Thailand and so here what I want everybody to see is that this grass is has a very extensive and deep root systems

**[00:53:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's basically what we want to do.

**[00:53:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grass is a great tool to regenerate land.

**[00:53:06] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we all know grasslands are probably one of the biggest ecosystems on earth.

**[00:53:12] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Forests are very important but from bare land to forest you will have to go through grassland.

**[00:53:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's the normal and it's the way nature works because grasses have the ability to cover land faster than forest.

**[00:53:29] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I've been a tree planter in Canada for many years.

**[00:53:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I have my two hands planted half a million trees and I know that trees they're a bit fragile.

**[00:53:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> one tree can take many years to grow and nurse and even when you put it on the ground I mean I hope you get the right religion because if you get over 30% of those trees to survive you're a very great person.

**[00:53:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And we're talking about mass tree planting.

**[00:54:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and the tree trees in your garden, you're doing a good job, if we want to reforest the land, it's going to take massive inputs.

**[00:54:07] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so tree planting is a great thing that everybody should promote, but yet we don't have the resources to do it.

**[00:54:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So grasses are very, very common and are a very usable way to go from real land to increase the biology.

**[00:54:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so why vertebrae been choosest is because it's sterile.

**[00:54:32] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the seeds, they don't go anywhere.

**[00:54:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So even if you get lucky enough after two, three years to get vertebrae they will never go.

**[00:54:42] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that is why it's been used as a tool and as a system overlap.

**[00:54:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if we want to go over the basic principle of vertebra system, so vertebrae is a grass, and it's just like any other grass if if you take into account

**[00:55:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> that it's sterile.

**[00:55:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But what makes it a great tool is that when it's planted on a contour line, and I take into account that many of you understand what's a contour line, the deep root system really helps management of water.

**[00:55:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, basically, better system is really in two words is increasing root mass.

**[00:55:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, in order to sink water into the soil, which is our goal at the end, we want the water to be in the soil.

**[00:55:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Now, just running off and going to the sea, we want the water as much as possible to be stored in the soil.

**[00:55:48] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, if you want to use the soil as a water battery, the best way to do it is to increase the root mass.

**[00:55:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And that's the goal of the better system, is really tools.

**[00:56:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Take a grass, put it on the contour line, like we can see here, this is very very grass, you can see the contours, and here it's used in an enter cropping with corn on maize, and it really takes the sow and uses it as a water battery.

**[00:56:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> there's a lot of different research papers that say that it uses 40 to 60% less water for irrigation, 30% less fertilizer, and it increases yield depending if we're talking about vegetables or grains.

**[00:56:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it has a lot of different advantages, but what really needs to be understand here is that bediver system uses deep rooted grass around contour lines.

**[00:56:55] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Let me go back, so this is a very

**[00:57:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Simple example that you can see that it's a two-year change.

**[00:57:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> A vertebrae will grow very fast and different trees will grow and native plants also will really enjoy the the barrier so that vertebra system often will be taking water in but also a lot of little birds animals and seeds will go down the hill be stopped by the by the hedge row and then it will start growing local vegetation.

**[00:57:45] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> a better bird is really resilient, it can sustain different pH levels of soil but what it really can take is shading.

**[00:57:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, over time when the night

**[00:58:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> actual vegetation takes over, very very well tend to disappear, because when the tree starts to be taller, the shade will kill the grass.

**[00:58:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we are really talking here about a 5 to 10 year solution, before it disappeared by itself.

**[00:58:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, here are the few points that I want people to keep in mind.

**[00:58:25] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Bediver is really deep through it, that's how it makes this grass so vital to put water into the soil.

**[00:58:38] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And it is fast growing, so we're talking about a three months period to really get the grass.

**[00:58:46] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, from the beginning, you need three weeks to get the grass implemented.

**[00:58:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, during those three weeks, you need to monitor it, you need to maybe provide some irrigation, but after the

**[00:59:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> three weeks, the grass is implemented.

**[00:59:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> After three months, it's already, it's ready to be how kind I said it.

**[00:59:11] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be detached and it can be used to grow some more better.

**[00:59:18] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So after six months, the plant is completely mature and it's ready to be cut to feed livestock, for example.

**[00:59:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is drought tolerant, so research has shown that vertebrae can sustain two years without rain and six months underwater.

**[00:59:39] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it's drought tolerant and water tolerant as well and it can be used for many purposes and we're going to see different examples that can show how vertebrae can be used in different aspects of restoration.

**[00:59:57] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Not only soil, but also for

**[01:00:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> water management.

**[01:00:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Different uses of the vetiver system, so soil conservation Oh, what would it be, soil management.

**[01:00:20] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It is used because the smell of the vetiver roots is very intense in oil.

**[01:00:28] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots is very oily and you might have seen very very used in the the industry to make perfume or the cosmetic industry overall and it is not something that we cover here but you have to know that it has an essence that is very strong and it's like lavender.

**[01:00:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Pest don't like it.

**[01:00:54] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So termite and it can be a real deal.

**[01:01:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> veteran for pets.

**[01:01:02] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's great as an enter cropping tool and the reason is because it's completely vertical so the roots don't go horizontally at all which really helps the vetiver being used with other products.

**[01:01:17] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It can be used also as a livestock feed, it's not the best grass for it but as it is drought tolerant when it's drought season farmers love having vetiver to feed their livestock.

**[01:01:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here is a project that we've founded and we've helped implement, this is me right here in Costa Rica, so this is a cow farm, so this is pasture and rivers used to go along and out of the cows were stepping on the river that used to make a big model and even cows die in the mud and using vetiver we were really able to

**[01:02:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Give a counter to the river so that plants were living on it.

**[01:02:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I don't want to take too much time here, but you can see it out on our website, how the river really helps, define the landscape, and regenerate the water stream.

**[01:02:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But basically it has different benefits about, well, I've heard so much John talking about carbon, but you know I had to put it here, because everybody talks about it, I have a little slice on it.

**[01:02:35] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But here is the example, really showed that birds were coming back to the water stream.

**[01:02:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Instead of a big mud puddle, it really became an ecosystem that is thriving, and cows really love taking only one path now.

**[01:02:50] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So they have a singular path, and it really helped regenerate the pasture.

**[01:03:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Because it takes so many minerals and it is used as a way to purify water.

**[01:03:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So again, on our website and on different resources, you can have a different example.

**[01:03:16] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> in the water management, it is used as we've seen for riverbank stabilization with treatment and also because the hedgerow is really strong, it really helps prevent landslides or any soil movement, especially in risk of flooding.

**[01:03:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So it really can be used in different foods.

**[01:03:44] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So here, as an enter cropping tool, it's been used in Africa.

**[01:03:52] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> We have different projects where we can see the benefits.

**[01:04:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> and pretty much nowadays, in most countries, that very very can be implemented because it's a tropical grass but can sustain frost.

**[01:04:10] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> is very rare projects in France.

**[01:04:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Very rare is now, very rare system is now, I think, in more than 90 countries around the world.

**[01:04:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> we know that it's in 25, frequent country right now.

**[01:04:26] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> In South East Asia, it's probably the place where very rare is being most used.

**[01:04:33] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Vietnam has great examples that have been able to maintain many infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and such.

**[01:04:47] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> South East Asia has a lot of different examples.

**[01:04:51] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> course, Central and South America are very good examples where very can be used.

**[01:04:56] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Here, I just want to show different resources if you have

**[01:05:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> more questions.

**[01:05:01] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> I think those are the best resources online.

**[01:05:04] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> the United Nations Development Program, I've put the link.

**[01:05:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So if anybody wants this presentation, I will share it with John at the end of this presentation.

**[01:05:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And so the UNDP has a great document about implementing better system.

**[01:05:24] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's very long document, but at the end, it can be really useful, the better network and to the has the greatest portal on all scientific papers done on better.

**[01:05:36] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's thousands of hours for those who want to read.

**[01:05:40] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> The Office of the Royal Development Project's Board of Thailand, sorry, I missed a little piece here, has a lot of papers as well.

**[01:05:53] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> And of course our website where you can find our project, but we're really based on

**[01:06:00] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> on creating projects on the ground while those organization has really put an effort on documenting what can be done.

**[01:06:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So you have here a little QR code to follow us on Instagram and you will find all the other links of our organization there.

**[01:06:21] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> But the goal of this presentation was for you when you present when you meet people and hopefully after this presentation you can have very very as a solution in your mind and you will contact us to be an ambassador for the universe soon enough.

**[01:06:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Thank you.

**[01:06:42] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you, Naviel.

**[01:06:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> A couple of hands have gone up.

**[01:06:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> This is going to be a very full meeting.

**[01:06:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So I'm gonna ask Jim to go first and then I'm gonna ask Milk to give his very short introduction, not the presentation that I'll be giving in a couple of weeks.

**[01:06:59] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Jim?

**[01:07:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, whatever it's propagated them by cutting because it doesn't see.

**[01:07:08] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> Yeah, it's by clumps.

**[01:07:11] JIM BLEDSOE**
> So, how is it salt parlance?

**[01:07:15] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, I would have to get the paper that I've read about South Carolina, but I can definitely show different examples where it is placed based to stabilize sand banks along the sea.

**[01:07:34] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, we know that it's really tolerant to sea salt, for example, and also for mining fields.

**[01:07:41] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> for mining fields that were abandoned are regenerated with better system.

**[01:07:49] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So, it's another example that it can really take different pH.

**[01:07:56] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Yeah, I will, I will, I will that it is.

**[01:08:00] JIM BLEDSOE**
> It dies off from shooting, and it grows right straight down.

**[01:08:04] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Does it spread around, though?

**[01:08:06] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Is it something to get it out of control?

**[01:08:09] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the roots, they do not reshoot.

**[01:08:13] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So there's no grasses coming out of the roots.

**[01:08:19] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> It's only the crown that can take different parts of the crown, and they will grow, again, given the proper solution.

**[01:08:31] Nabil Vetiver Without Borders**
> So the only way to propagate this is really by clumps.

**[01:08:36] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Wow, that sounded very interesting.

**[01:08:39] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Thank you.

**[01:08:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, thank you for my continuing education program.

**[01:08:43] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I've been reading and talking about it for a long time, but I really didn't understand the story.

**[01:08:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Now I do.

**[01:08:49] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bill, welcome.

**[01:08:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're a newcomer.

**[01:08:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Tell us a little bit about yourself, and it was a preview of your future self-introduction.

**[01:08:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But I guess you'd want to start with a question for Nabil.

**[01:09:00] Milt Markewitz**
> No, I wanted to let you know that, I want to let you know that I have a seven o'clock call, seven o' Portland time.

**[01:09:10] Milt Markewitz**
> And so I wanted to just say that I am going to be speaking.

**[01:09:15] Milt Markewitz**
> It's really good to see Russ.

**[01:09:17] Milt Markewitz**
> I had met him before, but see him, and I've worked with Cindy before, which is nice.

**[01:09:22] Milt Markewitz**
> My work is generally about co-creating a sustainable future.

**[01:09:29] Milt Markewitz**
> my work that I'll be talking about is to recognize that we in the Western world, who are speaking alphabetical languages, don't know what we don't know about life.

**[01:09:42] Milt Markewitz**
> The fundamental question that I'm always dealing with is what brings life?

**[01:09:46] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it flourish?

**[01:09:47] Milt Markewitz**
> Why does it thrive the way it does?

**[01:09:50] Milt Markewitz**
> And it's through the languages that there's an understanding of that.

**[01:09:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And what is there in the living languages that I want to be talking about next week?

**[01:10:00] Milt Markewitz**
> is an understanding that there are these incredible gifts that creation and nature has given to all life.

**[01:10:08] Milt Markewitz**
> And once we understand that, once that's embedded in the language, then we develop this deep appreciation, this gratitude, this understanding, because every utterance that we make is about life.

**[01:10:22] Milt Markewitz**
> And I know that sounds a little far-fetched, but when I work with kids and starting with about fourth or fifth graders and work through middle school and high school, give me one class period and just share a little bit about systemic understanding.

**[01:10:38] Milt Markewitz**
> What does that make me?

**[01:10:39] Milt Markewitz**
> What is it that brings life?

**[01:10:41] Milt Markewitz**
> And at the end of that period, they will shift sometimes unanimously from who they're being today and how they see their life work coming up to wanting to have an earth-based basis for their life work.

**[01:10:57] Milt Markewitz**
> So it's very important, this kind of paradigm shift.

**[01:11:00] Milt Markewitz**
> that we have.

**[01:11:01] Milt Markewitz**
> So anyway, I'll be talking for a half hour, next two weeks, I guess, in the morning.

**[01:11:08] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> it's quite early for you.

**[01:11:11] Milt Markewitz**
> It's six in the morning.

**[01:11:12] Milt Markewitz**
> It's okay.

**[01:11:13] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I got up at six this morning because I thought you were on at six and so it's fun.

**[01:11:18] Milt Markewitz**
> And I think that's that's probably all that needs really to be said.

**[01:11:25] Milt Markewitz**
> It is the indigenous people of the world that I found have the messages and I would like to just connect with what Nabios said for a moment.

**[01:11:34] Milt Markewitz**
> I think when we understand the flourishing of life, the way you expressed it, we will find out what people like Mahatma Gandhi and others have said about the road to peace and it's really through understanding life.

**[01:11:49] Milt Markewitz**
> And so anyway, there's a lot of good future in this work.

**[01:11:54] Milt Markewitz**
> And I guess the last thing I want to say is I really do want to connect if you haven't connected with Earth Repair.

**[01:12:00] Milt Markewitz**
> who's doing the same kind of work all over the world.

**[01:12:02] Milt Markewitz**
> I'll be glad to help you connect there.

**[01:12:04] Milt Markewitz**
> Cindy and I work with a gentleman named Jeff Gobo, who has the Consensus Institute.

**[01:12:11] Milt Markewitz**
> And boy, we really got to be working for Consensus and know how to get there.

**[01:12:15] Milt Markewitz**
> so I'm so happy to be here and networking with you, folks.

**[01:12:20] Milt Markewitz**
> Great, thank you.

**[01:12:21] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm as far as I'm looking forward to your presentation.

**[01:12:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We have worked with Jeff Gobo in the past.

**[01:12:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very wonderful and impressive guy.

**[01:12:32] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would love to strengthen our linkages to Earth Repair.

**[01:12:35] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I believe that Jake has got a connection to them also, but by all means, by the way, that's the other awesome responsibility of our members is to bring new members to the group.

**[01:12:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So we can build a network with just the kinds of people we're so happy to be collecting.

**[01:12:52] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay, see you next time, Mel.

**[01:12:54] Milt Markewitz**
> I got to sign off.

**[01:12:55] Milt Markewitz**
> Goodbye and thank you all.

**[01:12:56] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Bye.

**[01:13:02] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Craig Erickson is not here, I don't think, which is just as well, because David Castleman has been a present, but because Diego got here some weeks earlier, I'm going to let him introduce himself first.

**[01:13:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David, this is your forced education into the network, but David has got about six really great stories that I just wanted him to introduce himself.

**[01:13:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And then he's going to become a staple for future presentations also.

**[01:13:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So Diego, welcome, nice to see you again.

**[01:13:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, hello everybody, nice to see you all, short introduction.

**[01:13:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I arrived here because Rob Lewis introduced me, we wrote something for Chile after a very good article where he wrote about

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Dr.

**[01:14:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Milan Milan work, and let me say that it has been quite a good response here in Chile.

**[01:14:10] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We wrote an article today, it was published yesterday, and there was one politician that took it in a treater, and it has 50,000 reductions until now.

**[01:14:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So something that nobody talks here in Spanish, there's no scientific devocation in Spanish.

**[01:14:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can read a lot of English, but there's no one speaking in Spanish.

**[01:14:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So I think this is starting to light up, because it was pretty booming, someone showing up in the media, talking that carbon was not a problem, and that saving water things are starting to...

**[01:15:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> to move on.

**[01:15:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's that's a good news that I wanted to share.

**[01:15:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So for today I have a short presentation.

**[01:15:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I talked a couple of weeks ago with John and John Similke, tried to share your experience and it's quite broad and very different stuff and show that format technology from a startup that we made a couple of years ago that can be applied and vary in a lot of different situations.

**[01:15:34] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My work is sent from from an entrepreneur perspective, is building up building up the way that we can finance, crowd fund or put this words into action.

**[01:15:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So let me see if I can make it good.

**[01:15:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm gonna try to share screen pretty much a lot of

**[01:16:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> pages open, and you see share error, and you see it there, that's right.

**[01:16:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe you can see the presentation, it's not.

**[01:16:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm going to share the presentation in the chat.

**[01:16:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So maybe if you can.

**[01:16:46] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And I will put your.

**[01:16:53] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You're this set of the agenda, if you give me the link.

**[01:17:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is getting pretty close to use.

**[01:17:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, you're struggling with that.

**[01:17:11] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Cole has been having a conversation with Nabil.

**[01:17:15] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> suggests that I point out that Nabil is interested in connecting with anyone working on rotational grazing.

**[01:17:26] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> That would include Ed Hueling, who's lurking in the background here, as well as Roger Savory, who's the son of Alan Savory, and happily involved in that kind of thing.

**[01:17:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And we'll see who else emerges.

**[01:17:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Please look forward to.

**[01:18:03] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> you know it's not so bad in in this mode if you know I see what you got well does it work from there and you see the good question let me see if I can show it oh it's present I never be sure about present yeah I think so I'll share my screen I have to put this out maybe okay so now the only thing is all have to do the clicking yeah you're making me feel so much better because I'm not a tech guy and I need all the help I can get yeah I've never worked when you have a presentation and sharing it okay but well okay let's go let's go fast through here so I can

**[01:19:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> delay anything more.

**[01:19:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Just to say I'm a forester so I think as a forester and that's something that you will see in me in many moods.

**[01:19:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I always have a future thinking.

**[01:19:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm thinking in the forest when I have already planted the trees so I'm always thinking in what's going to be happening after.

**[01:19:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This brings me to a systemic thinking so Melamedo is the reference on this and made by this lecture for the ones that know about dyslexic thinking that mainly we are the kind of people that connect the dots and maybe much more in these groups I have that kind of thinking as well.

**[01:19:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My experience if I can take it pretty fast well for his engineer working in the

**[01:20:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Patagonia region.

**[01:20:01] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> When I was young, after that I moved into innovation and entrepreneurship issues, signing thinking skills, was CEO of a scientific center, and my last two experienced funding a startup that's called Miwerta Web.

**[01:20:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's where I can funding and the last four years working for the Ministry of Agriculture, where I could take this idea of startup to a national wide perspective for public policies and really making things happen in a territorial perspective and take it nationwide.

**[01:20:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I've always been related to education and lectures.

**[01:20:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I have a professor.

**[01:21:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> their soul and this is something that John asked like my social vision I think this is what he meant about.

**[01:21:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> My perspective is that rural communities are undervalued despite their valuable contribution.

**[01:21:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> They have the resources but they don't have the technology that enables and applies value for exchange.

**[01:21:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's one of the points that we tried to solve with this platform that's newer to it.

**[01:21:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you want to take it to an equation, you have natural capital, social capital, capital that plus work, labor, man time, you have a product.

**[01:21:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can have a beautiful farm with rain, with water, with good soil, but if you don't have a man that

**[01:22:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> goes up and work every day in the land, you're not going to have the product, you're not going to have potatoes, not going to have farm products.

**[01:22:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this would be the basic equation.

**[01:22:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And many times it's not that they don't have products and services, it's that they don't get the fair value for that products and services, because today is not easy to get and reach the market.

**[01:22:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And that's what we try to fold in with this with this web platform, I'm going to show you in the following.

**[01:22:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And there it is, it's the idea is connecting rural producer with a broader market through an integrated web platform that I'm going to show that amplifies their products and services, the ability to reach the market.

**[01:22:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me switch now to this one.

**[01:23:06] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, so I'll stop, I don't have the, I don't know to do this.

**[01:23:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you see this?

**[01:23:28] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm sharing now the webpage so I can make your short introduction to it.

**[01:23:33] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Well, right now we're seeing your Firefox homepage, so it may be the wrong window.

**[01:23:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Not loading yet?

**[01:23:48] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> No, I think you may be sharing the wrong window.

**[01:23:58] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank

**[01:24:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me see if I can put it back to, okay, now it should be like that.

**[01:24:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yes, yes.

**[01:24:33] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Okay, I'm not having audio back but this is a very simple web-based technology but what is behind this is that mainly we take territorial projects, in this case is a prop, where we invite people not to buy the credit.

**[01:25:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> crop, but to invest in a farmer.

**[01:25:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think that's a whole switch, mine switch, you know.

**[01:25:09] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you have this platform, instead of buying ledgers, you're gonna invest in one square meter of ledgers, and that square meter of ledgers is gonna give you back a crop, you know.

**[01:25:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It would be a kind of, yeah, of a higher agriculture, but take it to a square meter, you know.

**[01:25:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is the webpage, you choose project, say, I guess, and here is the page of the project.

**[01:25:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, pictures, you have a video from the farmer, the idea is that you can really see who is the farmer that is behind.

**[01:25:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's all about taking the value of the product of the ledgers.

**[01:25:57] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's taking also the social

**[01:26:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> and the environmental value.

**[01:26:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And why I talk about the environmental value?

**[01:26:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because when you buy a product, you know everything about the product.

**[01:26:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does the water come?

**[01:26:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> How do you make the weed control?

**[01:26:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> do you take control for insects, for other diseases?

**[01:26:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> From where does where did the seed come from?

**[01:26:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What did you use to get rid of the pests and stuff like that?

**[01:26:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a full transparency platform where you have a lot of information to know what the hell you're eating.

**[01:26:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because what we claim is that we don't know what we're putting into our mouth.

**[01:26:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And when you buy let's use your accomplice of that production.

**[01:26:58] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You can say I want a green world.

**[01:27:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you're buying led to someone that is poisoning the soil.

**[01:27:03] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it doesn't it doesn't work like that, you know So this is this is the main Mind shift that that you get if you really want to have an organic farming you have to be part of that organic farming and invest in for future crops, you know, but And there's another one especially if the risk of the transition to organic farming If it's not fair that the farmer has to make the transition and take all the risk and all the cost And we're gonna be standing at the end of the line and just gonna buy if They succeeded So that's why we're not transitioning because nobody wants to or nobody Small scale farmers can't make the deal of Switching to an organic farm because they need to rebuild

**[01:28:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> soil and stuff like that.

**[01:28:02] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So this is a way to promote farmers to take the and what else can I say of this?

**[01:28:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Well, did you buy it?

**[01:28:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> think I'm out of it.

**[01:28:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It might it might sound lousy but it's it's it's critical in this the same at all.

**[01:28:42] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here you don't have a shopping cart.

**[01:28:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You don't buy let's just buy a shopping cart because we need to invest on that.

**[01:28:50] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So what you do here is that you actually put some Mayan in your wallet.

**[01:28:56] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I can put 50,000 and then when you buy

**[01:29:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you're going to discount over that amount that you have.

**[01:29:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is kind of having a crypto coin or meward-to-web crypto coin.

**[01:29:11] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> No, because you invest in your wallet.

**[01:29:15] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> With that wallet, you buy ledgers.

**[01:29:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is very important because if the crop fails, you have 40% invested in a risk.

**[01:29:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So the farmer will have a 40% of the value of the crop if something happens and you will recover your money.

**[01:29:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So to make it easy, we just put your money back in your wallet.

**[01:29:40] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we can handle this issues if the farmer doesn't appear or doesn't the crop doesn't arrive or we have this money money.

**[01:29:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's very well thought in that process.

**[01:29:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what else?

**[01:30:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If we can sell a square meter of latches, we can sell a square meter of river restoration, of forest land conservation, of flowers for honeys, of solar or other reduction, of green to cool down.

**[01:30:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can sell everything.

**[01:30:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You just name it because the technology is the same thing.

**[01:30:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a project.

**[01:30:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a territorial, basic project, crowdfunding platform.

**[01:30:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We can just slip all the look and feel and put whatever you want in this.

**[01:30:43] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So that's the real value of the technology.

**[01:30:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And what does this mean for land conservation or for land conservation?

**[01:31:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let's say that the example that we were using in this analysis that we made about the channel or the Panama Channel River Basin.

**[01:31:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If you really want to handle, let's say, 50,000 of this project, you need to have a platform that can really handle this issue.

**[01:31:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's square meter of ledges.

**[01:31:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a square meter of bananas.

**[01:31:32] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> you, are we going to restore a watershed?

**[01:31:35] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Are we going to plant vetiver in contour lines?

**[01:31:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> What are we going to do?

**[01:31:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And then have a real good indicator of what are we going to pay for?

**[01:31:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And now let me try to share you a little bit of the of what is behind the back end platform.

**[01:32:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me go again, now it's a PowerPoint presentation, so I am, okay, very fast.

**[01:32:16] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> This is how you have a technology to handle different projects in a territory.

**[01:32:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You have a fair that it would be where you're going to sell the products.

**[01:32:29] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the producers that are linked to a fair, and you have the projects from a producer that are linked to a fair.

**[01:32:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So you choose your fair, and in that virtual fair, you're going to have all the producers, and all the producers are going to have all their products to share with them.

**[01:32:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> So when you say a fair, you mean like a market, yes?

**[01:32:55] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Sorry, I didn't hear that.

**[01:32:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> When you say a fair, I think.

**[01:33:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I think you mean like a public market, a virtual public market.

**[01:33:04] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you write it down?

**[01:33:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because I think I lost your audio.

**[01:33:08] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> well, here you can handle all the projects, create the fairs, different stuff.

**[01:33:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> let me take you to this one.

**[01:33:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage all the projects.

**[01:33:24] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> You manage different events in the projects.

**[01:33:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And especially this one, Itos, that would be like milestones.

**[01:33:37] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me show you this.

**[01:33:39] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We pay the farmer for every milestone.

**[01:33:45] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So here it goes.

**[01:33:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> If he prepares the soil, he owns a 10% of the value of the project.

**[01:33:54] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Because he made his work, and we're going to pay him before he gets the crop.

**[01:34:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> he has cash to foresee, you know, at the, let's say in the middle of the crop, you have a crop of 90 days, he in this 20 days he's going to be receiving an amount of money at 10% of the price.

**[01:34:14] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Then you have the plantation, then you have the weed control, and at least you can have 40% that is on risk, you know, that the farmer made the project, made the work.

**[01:34:26] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And if he fails in between because of the draw of a fire above wild animal, whatever, okay, where you share the risk with them.

**[01:34:36] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And this is fair because if you share as a consumer the risk with the farmer, you're going to share the risk for one square meter.

**[01:34:48] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And the farmer has to have a risk for 100 square meters.

**[01:34:53] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So when you have 100 consumers sharing the risk, what you do is you dilute the risk.

**[01:35:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So it's easier or it's more economically visible to hold on to some constraints or some problems in the crops.

**[01:35:12] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> The interesting thing is that you can use the same technology to handle a project and pay for miles.

**[01:35:22] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> First, you're going to prepare the land, you're going to plant the trees, you're going to thin.

**[01:35:30] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And you can be managing a project for whatever purpose is, because you can have this milestone and you have the whole platform that automates the paying for this.

**[01:35:49] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> After you click the button and then you say, okay, this milestone was achieved automatically, the farmer receives a payment.

**[01:36:00] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> on his virtual card that here in Chile we have it almost everyone has a bank card 20.

**[01:36:13] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And well data, it's all about data.

**[01:36:18] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Here the farmer knows who is the one that is buying and we know and and and the consumer knows who is the farmer, where he lives, his family, and and information to have a social bonding with the one that produces your food.

**[01:36:38] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> That's dense version.

**[01:36:41] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> And yes, the platform is pretty easy.

**[01:36:47] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We have we shared it with with people in Mexico that wanted to use it.

**[01:36:52] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> So we have native corn, nopal, and amarantho, and nice.

**[01:37:05] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I'm not sure it was the best presentation to understand whatever, but it really made my best.

**[01:37:17] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Yeah, the presentation is in the link and has my emails and whatever is needed.

**[01:37:30] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Thank you.

**[01:37:31] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Oh, let me.

**[01:37:51] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> It's a public market, yeah, it's a public market.

**[01:38:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, Jim, you actually, Jim, I think maybe, given that Diego is having a lot of your problems.

**[01:38:06] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Yeah, if you can't hear me, why don't you type your question?

**[01:38:17] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'll try that.

**[01:38:18] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Okay.

**[01:38:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> All right, then.

**[01:38:21] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I think I lost.

**[01:38:23] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> I lost the algorithm.

**[01:38:25] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Can you hear me?

**[01:38:26] JIM BLEDSOE**
> Okay.

**[01:38:27] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> We hear you.

**[01:38:29] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> You can't hear.

**[01:38:31] Diego Gonzalez Carvallo**
> Let me shut down some.

**[01:38:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I'm going to mute him for now.

**[01:38:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We'll respect and introduce our last speaker.

**[01:38:45] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> David Kesselman, who comes to us by way of Ian Redmond and John D.

**[01:38:51] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Lou and David, are you still here?

**[01:38:54] David Casselman**
> I am indeed at the critical moment.

**[01:38:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> There he is.

**[01:38:57] David Casselman**
> Okay.

**[01:39:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> can introduce yourself and take it away.

**[01:39:03] David Casselman**
> Thank you.

**[01:39:04] David Casselman**
> So I'll try and be as succinct as I can, cover as much ground without saying too much.

**[01:39:11] David Casselman**
> I'm going to already lost my image, so I will try and reset the camera.

**[01:39:16] David Casselman**
> There we go.

**[01:39:17] David Casselman**
> So I'm a recovering trial lawyer.

**[01:39:20] David Casselman**
> All you professors and scientists and engineers and foresters and people with experience that I don't have offer a great deal of information I can certainly learn from.

**[01:39:34] David Casselman**
> But I spent about 40 years of my career as a trial lawyer doing pro bono work for animals.

**[01:39:41] David Casselman**
> And when I retired right at the start of the COVID, I realized that my way of giving back to animals and the planet had sort of been severed by my decision to retire.

**[01:39:56] David Casselman**
> I had to find a new way to give.

**[01:40:00] David Casselman**
> Because I'm as worried as all of you and I feel like the world went to hell in a handbasket on my watch It was beautiful when I was a little boy and it's just progressively gotten worse.

**[01:40:09] David Casselman**
> And so I Decided to start a new venture.

**[01:40:14] David Casselman**
> It's called eco flicks.

**[01:40:16] David Casselman**
> It's the first streaming Video service for animals in the planets nonprofit worldwide we're on Apple and Android and Amazon fire roku Samsung TV If you go to the website, it's just www dot eco flicks and It was created at first to support wildlife filmmaking, which was being shut down with the death of animal planet and that geo and so many other places people went and Wildlife filmmakers who've made all these films had no outlet and And I had been involved in making a film earlier and I felt like it was a really important tool

**[01:41:00] David Casselman**
> To change behavior and that's kind of at the root of everything I'm doing.

**[01:41:04] David Casselman**
> It's it's like carbon credit programs They don't change any behavior.

**[01:41:08] David Casselman**
> They make money for polluters.

**[01:41:10] David Casselman**
> They allow people to Prove their ESG on paper, but they're not changing their behavior at all, and I I really resent and rebel at that notion.

**[01:41:20] David Casselman**
> So On top of trying to support wildlife filmmakers we decided we would support NGOs that we're doing great work We have almost 70 partners now worldwide and we're free to schools worldwide Our goal is to provide beautiful inspiring images.

**[01:41:37] David Casselman**
> No commercials.

**[01:41:38] David Casselman**
> No gruesome imagery any child can watch it.

**[01:41:42] David Casselman**
> We have diverse programming almost 1600 titles approaching 2000 hours of programming and Our goal is to Touch the world at the heart not at the mind And so many of the things that you're talking about which are very similar

**[01:42:00] David Casselman**
> sophisticated and important are not within our scope, not because we don't care about them, but because our mechanism for affecting change is different.

**[01:42:12] David Casselman**
> In addition to EcoFlix, the channel, I have, this is the necessary John Slideshow, apparently everybody has one, so I'll quickly take you through it.

**[01:42:28] David Casselman**
> This is the look of our website.

**[01:42:32] David Casselman**
> It's phone based because you can use it on your phone or any computer device as well as your TV.

**[01:42:38] David Casselman**
> We are live with a partner of global environmental media as well as our programming, and we have swim lanes of shows.

**[01:42:49] David Casselman**
> Some are free, but most you subscribe to, unless you're falling in the category we've talked about, which are free.

**[01:42:55] David Casselman**
> There's countless swim lanes involved.

**[01:43:00] David Casselman**
> And so the work we've been doing there is growing, it's been five years now, and we're very proud of where we've gone.

**[01:43:06] David Casselman**
> We've won awards with many of our films.

**[01:43:09] David Casselman**
> And we attack all different kinds of issues like this free Billy film was about my efforts for eight years as a trial lawyer to get Billy the elephant out of the LA Zoo.

**[01:43:19] David Casselman**
> The show sanctuary has three different episodes involving different sanctuaries that continues to grow as we make more films and many, many more.

**[01:43:28] David Casselman**
> did a film called The Last Stand about Clear Cutting Forest at one awards.

**[01:43:32] David Casselman**
> We just partnered with King Charles on a film about climate change with involving children.

**[01:43:38] David Casselman**
> We've been narrated and animated an amazing children's book.

**[01:43:43] David Casselman**
> we're doing very eclectic things, but under the Netflix umbrella, we're also doing our own thing.

**[01:43:50] David Casselman**
> And that is, I go to bed at night, like all of you, and I can't stand that there are serious problems affecting the planet.

**[01:44:00] David Casselman**
> particularly animals which really get me that nobody's doing anything about some of them people talk about many they don't but One that really bothers me is ship strikes involving elephant about involving whales and I Asked and asked and nobody had a clue what could be done one night I just woke up with an idea thought maybe satellite imagery could be a good way of tracking and quickly realized that doesn't work for a Lot of reasons, and then I fell into the idea of drones and started studying it I hired experts and for two and a half years now We've been developing a whale watch program to equip every ship with two drones to oversee the Operations in front of the ship tied into the bridge These are unique There's no drones quite like them.

**[01:44:50] David Casselman**
> They will Operate autonomously they'll drop a battery every time they need it and go back out within a minute They have all different kinds of camera equipment for

**[01:45:00] David Casselman**
> for low-resolution night vision, infrared, we'll have probably testing LiDAR soon, and we can, we built in with AI, the ability to identify many species of whales, as well as tracking other targets, and the idea is basically to put an end to this blindness at day and night when these ships are gonna hit whales.

**[01:45:22] David Casselman**
> Part of this is because whales are critically important to phytoplankton.

**[01:45:26] David Casselman**
> They're a key part of the life cycle of phytoplankton, and phytoplankton is, I'm sure you all know better than I do, not only it's probably the most significant carbon sequestration source on the planet, but also as John taught me, it releases aerosols, is responsible for clouds, and is a key part of global cooling.

**[01:45:46] David Casselman**
> So all of these things tie into the whale, and we're trying to create a carbon credit type program, but tied to biodiversity, working with Cambridge University, and some people there who are well along.

**[01:46:00] David Casselman**
> in this concept and I'm trying to shift them and I think I'm making ground to create a really meaningful biodiversity program to really focus on animals on the planet and each will require you to change your behavior.

**[01:46:14] David Casselman**
> So ship owners that take part in this program will get paid for avoiding whales and that will change their behavior.

**[01:46:21] David Casselman**
> Another program we have is sequestration and farmers all over the world burn their crops with a rather obvious result.

**[01:46:36] David Casselman**
> It's deadly and there's a huge cost and no upside to them.

**[01:46:43] David Casselman**
> We have developed a program where they can leave a little bit of the crop remaining take the remainder of the harvest, veil it and with permission drop it in the deep ocean where it will be sequestered in the exact location where it will end up anyway.

**[01:47:00] David Casselman**
> Many years later, but that's what happens.

**[01:47:02] David Casselman**
> goes through the carbon, the carbon goes into the atmosphere, falls back to the earth, rivers, ocean and deep ocean.

**[01:47:09] David Casselman**
> We skip the hydrologic cycle and put it straight where it belongs, and the farmer gets paid for it, doesn't have to deal with all this.

**[01:47:16] David Casselman**
> It's very low tech, very efficient, very little carbon involved, and we've already got clients buying into this, and again, it changes behavior, which is critical to me.

**[01:47:29] David Casselman**
> We're working on a project in Botswana.

**[01:47:32] David Casselman**
> It came to my attention.

**[01:47:33] David Casselman**
> were filming there, we do all our filming sustainably, which means we use local camera people.

**[01:47:39] David Casselman**
> We do everything by we transfer and then produce it in a studio in London.

**[01:47:43] David Casselman**
> I learned from the guys that was working with it, the president of Botswana and his infinite wisdom lifted the hunting ban that had protected some of the most beautiful biodiverse place on earth.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> to do something.

**[01:48:00] David Casselman**
> So we banded together, four of us, and we acquired 7,400 acres, and we have solar fenced it.

**[01:48:09] David Casselman**
> We left openings only for migratory pathways.

**[01:48:12] David Casselman**
> We patrol the perimeter.

**[01:48:15] David Casselman**
> We've drilled and created our own lakes for the animals to come in, which they are coming into.

**[01:48:21] David Casselman**
> And we're building a first, a high-end tent camp for corporations to bring their employees annually as a retreat and teach them about what's going on.

**[01:48:30] David Casselman**
> The animals will be right there, and the chiefs around us, eight chiefs, have applied to the president for 340 additional acres to join our efforts to stop this hunting as far as we can.

**[01:48:45] David Casselman**
> We're also working to try and stop the forest, clear-cutting of forests in Southeast Asia and in Sri Lanka.

**[01:48:57] David Casselman**
> started a sanctuary with a partner.

**[01:49:00] David Casselman**
> Cambodia in 2001.

**[01:49:02] David Casselman**
> I was very fortunate to start soon after to partner with like a child who's probably the single most remarkable person I know of on the planet.

**[01:49:10] David Casselman**
> What she's done with the most humble background is kind of unbelievable.

**[01:49:16] David Casselman**
> And she and I have worked together on many projects including Cambodia and her project in Ella of the Nature Park in Chippewa Mai.

**[01:49:25] David Casselman**
> And I learned through her and in all of my projects because I lack the expertise I partner with true people, experts first of all in the environment, the cultures of the different countries I'm involved with and then also bringing experts from all over the world where necessary to make sure we get the science right.

**[01:49:45] David Casselman**
> But in Thailand and Sri Lanka there's a huge problem and in particular starting in Sri Lanka the human elephant conflicts have reached an unbelievable proportion.

**[01:49:56] David Casselman**
> Who elephants an elephant dies

**[01:50:00] David Casselman**
> Every day and a human dies every other day in this crisis and it's all because humans have blocked their migratory paths they are trying to make money by a variety of different means not just capturing the babies and selling them to zoos and street beggars and things like that but they also Think that they compete with their crops like tea gardens and things because they just barge in and eat them which their elephants they do but We've designed a program to restore all the forests that have been clear cut which is massive there and all the forestry is sold primarily to China and the elephants all in one move in a Behavior-changing biodiversity credit we want to replant all the clear cut forests save all the existing forest and protect elephants captive and in prison

**[01:51:00] David Casselman**
> and those that are used for trekking, street begging, et cetera, they will be paid to release them into the forest to do their work as natural gardeners of the forest.

**[01:51:09] David Casselman**
> Studies have proven in Gabon that elephants tending to forests and feeding there actually increased the sequestration of the big hardwoods by a significant percentage.

**[01:51:19] David Casselman**
> And so with studies in Southeast Asia, we intend to create credit programs there, both for the forest tree work and saving there, as well as the protection of the elephants.

**[01:51:31] David Casselman**
> Same thing, in Thailand only it's a different problem.

**[01:51:35] David Casselman**
> president of Sri Lanka has asked us to come there.

**[01:51:37] David Casselman**
> In Thailand, it was a huge uphill fight.

**[01:51:41] David Casselman**
> The newest prime minister that was elected was rejected by the king.

**[01:51:46] David Casselman**
> And the government is a triumvirate of parliament, royal family and military.

**[01:51:52] David Casselman**
> And you have to work with all of them or you don't work with any of them, because one of them will take you out.

**[01:51:56] David Casselman**
> So, Lek, who has tremendous context,

**[01:52:00] David Casselman**
> There, again, my partner has cleared that path.

**[01:52:03] David Casselman**
> It's taken us two and a half years, but they now want us to come in and build this program.

**[01:52:10] David Casselman**
> And if we can make it fly, it will change the face of Southeast Asia.

**[01:52:15] David Casselman**
> And it's a huge project that we're committed to, much like whales and crops.

**[01:52:22] David Casselman**
> If we can make a difference, it's small or as big as we can make it, that's the goal.

**[01:52:27] David Casselman**
> So that's what I'm up to.

**[01:52:28] David Casselman**
> And I have a lot of other things, but this is what keeps me up days and nights.

**[01:52:36] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> It's a very impressive portfolio, I got to say, and great.

**[01:52:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> think I look forward to hearing more about each of those projects in the future.

**[01:52:47] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> By the way, David is a filmmaker, and he is interested in film-worthy projects that you may know of or that our members may be involved in.

**[01:53:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:53:09] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I will say hello to Cindy Irettes, but she prefers not to speak, not to speak, I believe.

**[01:53:19] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But she gave us a really nice letter of introduction, which I put into the agenda.

**[01:53:25] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> And the letter of introduction also includes news of Walter Jenner's current health struggles, about which he does not want a big deal to be made.

**[01:53:39] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> But he senses regards, and Cindy, I hope you'll convey hours to him.

**[01:53:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> I would say that at least half of the people in the alliance, including me, were sort of inducted and electrified by catching on to Walter's work.

**[01:53:57] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Very important, which, by the way,

**[01:54:00] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Um, I have come to understand you and bio for climate, um, help to bring to the non Australian world.

**[01:54:07] Cindy Eiritz**
> So yeah, my apologies.

**[01:54:11] Cindy Eiritz**
> I actually have a voice disorder.

**[01:54:12] Cindy Eiritz**
> So after about three or four minutes, my voice gets all rasping cuts out, which kind of works really well with the sort of two years and one mouth kind of thing.

**[01:54:21] Cindy Eiritz**
> I sort of do a lot of listening, but yeah, so my apologies for not doing a proper presentation.

**[01:54:27] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> Fair enough.

**[01:54:28] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We look forward to collaborating through lots of communication channels.

**[01:54:34] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:37] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We've actually, as far as I know, gotten through everything on the agenda.

**[01:54:41] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
> We didn't do old timer introductions.

**[01:54:44] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)

**[01:54:50] Jon Schull** (jschull@e-nable.org)
