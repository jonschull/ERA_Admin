I have practiced organic gardening since childhood, organic farming for much of my adult Life, and regenerative horticulture, food forestry, and wildland restoration for the last decade. The studies and practices which inform my agroecology and ecorestoration thought and work (research, practice, and education) include western science soil biology/ecology; many realms of mycology, botany, ecology, and zoology; ecological anthropology and history; ethnobotany; herbalism; plant/fungi medicine work; \u201cconventional\u201d regenerative agriculture; ancient Indigenous agroecology and ecological land management sciences; landscape water retention; wetland restoration; syntropic agroforestry; food forestry; desert reforestation; Miyawaki reforestation; and ecology/climate physics (including Biotic Pump Theory). I integrate these western science studies, modern agroecology and ecorestoration practices, indigenous agroecology traditions and TEK, anthropogenic landscape studies, food/medicine work, and ecological history into a coherent picture of what human relationship with Earth looks like when we act as a steward species. My studies and practices focus on helping people meet their needs while restoring ecosystems and stabilizing global climate. I live in the Mimbres watershed near the Gila wilderness area, in the most northern range of the Chihuahua desert, in the unceded lands of the living Chiricahua peoples, of the Brown Bear, of the Jaguar, of the Beaver, and of the Forests and Wetlands which stood there 400 years ago.\n\u2026 more\n\nActivity\n\n152 followers\n\nWilliam has no recent posts\n\nRecent posts William shares will be displayed here.\n\nShow all\n\nPeople also viewed\n\nAndrew Ungerleider\n\n\u00b7 2nd\n\nFounder/CEO\n\nConnect\n\nVivienne Bachelet\n\n\u00b7 2nd\n\nDr.\n\nConnect\n\nAndrew Paul Leonard \n\n\u00b7 2nd\n\nPhotographer, Microscopist and Digital Media Professional in Medicine and Science.
