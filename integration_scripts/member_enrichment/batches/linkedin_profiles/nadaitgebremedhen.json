Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. As a natural systems thinker, I excel at creative problem-solving, a skill that doesn\u2019t get much play in clinical medicine, where protocols and guidelines largely govern practice. \n\n2. I\u2019m not convinced that the way we\u2019ve organized our world\u2014where prosperity is available to only a small fraction of humanity\u2014is at all inevitable, and I\u2019m deeply invested in working towards change on that front.  It\u2019s a focus area that, admittedly, lies outside the scope of medicine.\n\n3. I don\u2019t believe the solution to many challenges in my part of the world, Africa, lies in creating low-cost versions of sleek Global North technologies or deploying clever ad hoc fixes. While those approaches have their place, lasting change requires tackling the complex systems that create and perpetuate poverty. We must re-think the laws and institutions that reinforce global economic inequality\u2014\u2014a task that, again, goes well beyond the scope of clinical medicine.\n\nMy work now is in global development and is anchored in creating a world where everyone can\u2014and will\u2014do well. At Hagush, we\u2019re making digital technology access universal while also tackling the deeper structural issues that perpetuate global economic inequality.\n\u2026 more\n\nActivity\n\n1,816 followers\n\nPosts\nComments\nImages\nDocuments\n\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD \n \u2022 1st\n\nSocial Entrepreneur & Physician | CEO @Hagush \u2014building cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable development solutions | Civic & Social Innovation\n\n1d \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nExcited to join #CatalysingChangeWeek2025, orchestrated by Catalyst Now \u2014 where bold ideas meet collaborative action!\n\nThis year\u2019s theme, Converging Forces: Where Innovation Meets Impact, brings together changemakers from every sector to drive real systems change.\n\nDon\u2019t miss our session \"Rethinking How We Fund Social Impact: Doing More With Less\" \u2014 join the conversation shaping a better future!\n\nRegister here: \u00a0\u27a1\ufe0f https://lnkd.in/eHHiVXcM\n\nMichael Gilligan Gannon Gillespie In\u00eas Caldeira Marques Maura Donlan Nadia Kist\n\n#CCW2025 #CatalysingChangeWeek #SocialInnovation\n\u2026 more\n\n9 reactions\n9\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD \n \u2022 1st\n\nSocial Entrepreneur & Physician | CEO @Hagush \u2014building cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable development solutions | Civic & Social Innovation\n\n6d \u2022 \n\nVery much looking forward to this!\n\nAfrica Forward\n\n927 followers\n\n6d \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nAcross the continent, there are generations of social innovators who are rewriting Africa\u2019s story, not through theory, but through action, courage, and creativity. \n\nFrom grassroots communities to national movements, these leaders are showing what\u2019s possible when ideas meet purpose.\n\nIn this powerful session moderated by Luvuyo Rani ,\n\nWe\u2019ll hear from GISELE M.YITAMBEN , Nadait Gebremedhen, MD , and Sipho Mwanza , as they share their personal journeys, what inspired their work, the challenges they\u2019ve faced, and how they\u2019re building solutions that drive meaningful change.\n\nTheir stories remind us why it\u2019s vital to spotlight and celebrate the people leading Africa\u2019s transformation,\u00a0inspiring the current & next generation of innovators, dreamers, and doers who are shaping the continent\u2019s future.\n\nAs we close Catalyzing Change Week 2025, we do so on an inspiring note, one that celebrates the power of African voices, community, and collaboration in shaping a brighter, more inclusive future.\n\nBe part of this conversation. \n\nRegister now to join us: https://lnkd.in/grazwH3T\n\nPearl Uzokwe Yogavelli Nambiar Adrianne Wabakwira Hagush OpenNet For All Zambia Catalyst Now\n\u2026 more\n\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD and 19 others reacted\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD and 19 others\n\n1 repost\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD \n \u2022 1st\n\nSocial Entrepreneur & Physician | CEO @Hagush \u2014building cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable development solutions | Civic & Social Innovation\n\n6d \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nExpanding the pool of resources for impact and international development isn\u2019t just about mobilizing more funding \u2014 it\u2019s also about designing smarter, resource-efficient funding processes that reduce waste and ensure every dollar delivers maximum impact.\n\nLooking forward to sharing more on this with Michael Gilligan at Catalyst Now\u2019s #CatalyzingChangeWeek2025 on\u00a0Nov 3rd. \nRegistration here \u27a1\ufe0f https://lnkd.in/eHHiVXcM\n\nRead more on how the current funding paradigm might be costing the social sector\u00a0more than it\u2019s worth\u00a0here \u27a1\ufe0f https://lnkd.in/eAR_NPyk\nRead more on the case for changing the current paradigm here \u27a1\ufe0f https://lnkd.in/en8J2FVN\n\nIn\u00eas Caldeira Marques Gannon Gillespie Maura Donlan Nadia Kist\n\u2026 more\n\n22 reactions\n22\n\n3 comments\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD \n \u2022 1st\n\nSocial Entrepreneur & Physician | CEO @Hagush \u2014building cost-effective, sustainable, and scalable development solutions | Civic & Social Innovation\n\n2w \u2022 \n\nI'm  in Washington, DC, this week for the Fall edition of The World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings.

Wait, what?  \n\nThe message below is worth real attention. In case it needs repeating, the second half of the opening sentence says:  \n\nhundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 that could go to our sector at this crucial moment. \n\nAnd as we dug deeper our take is that's a LOW estimate.  But we only have 3 weeks. If you can be a part of getting this funded please do. \n\nIf you are working in Philanthropy as an advisor or infrastructure org, and want to be a part of the call we are co-hosting next week including Catalyst Now, Propel Philanthropy and others to drive towards this goal, please register or reach out.  \n\nPlease share this with folks who would be interested in contributing or who might know those who would be. \n\nThe broader approach being used here is also powerful and in my opinion, under-used. Stay tuned on that.  ;) \n\nJoin the linkedin event, zoom sign-up will follow.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/das_FkrX\n\u2026 more\n\nThe Urgent Immediate Action Group\n\nPeter Brach \u2022 2nd\n\n3w \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nIf we can raise $200,000 by October 26, we have the potential to increase donations this GivingTuesday by tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Failing to reach this goal means thousands of nonprofits will miss out on critical funding.\n\nAs an example, last year GivingTuesday invested $80,000 in a media campaign, which significantly contributed to raising $500 million in additional donations and engaging 2.1 million more people. With an extra $200,000 this year, we can exceed those results and drive even more giving.\n\nWe are a temporary action group formed to address an unprecedented crisis: nonprofits are facing severe budget cuts. Our mission is to mobilize a dedicated group of individuals to take immediate, actionable steps to support thousands of nonprofits in need.\n\nThis initiative is being led by Catalyst Now, Propel Philanthropy, the Systems Studio, and Robert Roth, PhD. We invite you to join us in this crucial effort.\n\nFor those with questions about our projections, we understand they may seem ambitious. The following resources provide deeper insights and data supporting our goals:\n\n- A prospectus by GivingTuesday: https://lnkd.in/gEgMFSEa\n- A comprehensive analytics report specific to this campaign: https://lnkd.in/gpM3zhZv\n- Propel Philanthropy\u2019s public page about this campaign: https://lnkd.in/gbeXUbc8\n\u2026 more\n\nHelping Nonprofits in Crisis\n\npropelphilanthropy.org\n\n5 reactions\n5\n\n2 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n1 repost\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD reposted this\n\nMarco De Biasi \n \u2022 2nd\n\nStartups Investor & Advisor /Accelerator Program Director at Founder Institute Brasil/Conselheiro Fiscal Italcam\n\n2w \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nIt was a pleasure to participate as speaker at the \u201cEmpowering the Next Generation of Social Entrepreneurs\u201d panel at Horasis Global Meeting 2025, held at the USP - Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo on October 8-9. \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 Chaired by Rania Hoteit together with Nadait Gebremedhen, MD, Sara Hughes, Dr. Osama Bin Noor, Dr. Stacy L.

It\u2019s a fascinating and important shift, a chance to redefine how we think about progress itself.\nYet every time a government speaks to a credit rating agency or investor, the conversation still begins and ends with the same familiar figures: GDP growth, GDP per capita, debt-to-GDP. This is because it is the shared language that markets understand.\n\nMy new Substack essay - The Shared Language Problem - looks at what happens when these two measurement systems meet. Can we design metrics that are meaningful for people and the planet and legible to investors? Or will governments be forced to live between two incompatible scorecards - one that defines progress, and another that defines risk?\n\nYou can read it here: https://lnkd.in/eYNw7xrc\n\nThe Credit Rating Research Initiative #creditratings #UN #GDP #Economics #data #Planet #benefits #sustainability \n\u2026 more\n\n13 reactions\n13\n\n3 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n2 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nNadait Gebremedhen, MD reposted this\n\nMariana Mazzucato \n \u2022 Following\n\nProfessor in the Economics of Innovation and Public Value, University College London, Founder & Director of IIPP at UCL\n\n1mo \u2022 \n\nIf any new global order is to be a success, long-term structural transformation is required.
