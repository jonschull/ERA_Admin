Their rhizomes  spread aggressively over the entire area in which one single shoot was planted with the underground rhizomes allowing for new shoots and culms to emerge. Depending on the situation,it could be a disadvantage due to high costs of maintenance or perhaps an advantage interms of high yields associated with it.\n\n\ud83c\udf33At EcoFreak, we are raising the alternative choice. The Oxytenanthera abyssinica famously know as the African bamboo and the ever green bamboo.\ud83c\udf43\nIt is mostly a clumping bamboo that grows in dense cluster of culms in a contained area making it non invasive and easy to manage. It's rhizomes spread but not as much as the Phyllostachys.\n\nIt's is one of the most versitile bamboo in terms of application and growing conditions. It grows in the  East and Central Africa.\ud83c\udf0d\n \nUnlike most bamboo species which are hollow and light weight, the African Bamboo has solid or semi solid culms that gives it a superior tensile strength making it one of the top choices for construction\ud83c\udfd7 and furniture\ud83d\udeaa.With this, It's a natural alternative to timber, reducing pressure on forests\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33.\n\nBecause of its drought resistance, its able to grow in dry areas and with an extensive root system  its suitable for erosion control. Its can therefore be grown along river banks . All these make it one of the Climate solutions we need\ud83c\udf41\n\n\ud83c\udf33As we protect out forests we have to think of other feasible alternatives to ensure sustainability in our efforts\ud83d\udc63\n\nThe interesting things about value addition in Bamboo  as we saw at Amabanda Uganda Limited is the true definition of a zero waste and  circular economy that we so much need right now.\n\nAnd for the african bamboo every part of the plant has a purpose. The leaves serve as valuable animal fodder, the young shoots are a source of food, and the stems can be processed into biofuel and more.\n\n\ud83d\udcccWhich bamboo fact did you just find out? Share with your thoughts with us in the comments.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Dr Charles Koojo Amooti from #KontikibambooWorks for his presentation on Common Bamboo species in Uganda during the Amabanda Uganda Limited Bamboo processing Masterclass.\n\n#sustainability #bioeconomy #africanbamboo #innovation #sustainablesolutions\n#climateaction\n\n\u2026 more\n\n1/2\n\nInnocent Ociti and 27 others reacted\nInnocent Ociti and 27 others\n\n4 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n3 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nTheopista Abalo reposted this\n\nEcoFreak\n\n130 followers\n\n2mo \u2022 \n\n\ud83c\udf8bThe more the sustainable solutions the better for our forests!!\ud83c\udf8b\n\nWe recently attended a highly informative Masterclass on the Commercial Processing of bamboo, hosted by Bamboo Uganda and its partners, like Bijimu Bamboo Farming Services Amabanda Uganda Limited and EKiBBO Farming Services Ltd.\n\n It was inspiring to see so many architects\ud83d\udc72 in attendance, a clear sign that sustainable solutions are becoming mainstream and a significant part of our daily choices \u2705\ufe0f \n\n\ud83c\udf8dBamboo is more than just a material it's one of the carbon storing Gurus. By transforming it into beautiful crafts and durable buildings, we're locking away carbon and building a more sustainable future.\n\n \ud83c\udf8dThe session provided a deep dive into the entire process, from treating the raw material to converting it into a wide range of finished products. Every piece of beautiful craft or strong building contributes to this effort.\n\n\ud83c\udf8dHowever, despite all these innovations, a critical question remains, why is the number of bamboo farmers still so low? \n\nInstitutions like Amabanda Uganda Limited are at the forefront of this solution. They empower \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\uddd2\u200d\ud83e\uddd2 communities by teaching them to grow bamboo,they purchase their harvests, and also train them to create various products. \n\n\ud83c\udf43For a forest community, this not only sustains their livelihoods but also provides a viable alternative to forest dependency.\n\n\ud83c\udf8bConsidering that it takes up to six years for bamboo to reach maturity, it feels like we are six years behind in our efforts to protect more forests.\n\nIn the coming days, we will be sharing more of our takeaways from this incredible session, including a look at the different types of bamboo species right here in Uganda and beyond, their treatment methods, and their immense benefits to the environment.\ud83c\udf0f\n\nStay tuned to learn more!\n\n\n#sustainability\n#bamboorevolution\n#sustainablealternatives\n\n\u2026 more\n\n1/4\n\nSunday Geofrey and 123 others reacted\nSunday Geofrey and 123 others\n\n14 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n8 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nTheopista Abalo reposted this\n\nEva Ntara \u2022 2nd\n\nArtsy Environmentalist\n\n3mo \u2022 \n\nFrom 14\u201316 July, I facilitated the #AIM4Forests Young #ForestChampions workshop in Kampala, Uganda \u2013 an inspiring gathering of 10 passionate young leaders from across the country.\n\nOrganized by FAO Uganda, the Ministry of Water and Environment, the National Forestry Authority, and Youth Go Green, the workshop focused on equipping Uganda\u2019s next generation of forest leaders to support the country\u2019s goal of reaching 24% forest cover by 2040.\n\nWe planted 200 indigenous seedlings at Mpanga Forest Reserve and used FAO\u2019s Open Foris Ground to geolocate each tree gaining hands-on experience in digital forest monitoring.\n\nRead more here: https://lnkd.in/dPhvvJb4\n\nWhat stood out to me most?

In the same room, we were honoured to have knowledgeable foresters like Ndyabandiho saul and Derrick Rukundo from the #MinistryofWaterandEnvironment,  who inspired budding foresters like me with their stories of how they progressed from their early studies to their current positions.\n\nWe learnt about the FAO's forest monitoring tools and their practical applications in the field. One tool, called #Ground, is user-friendly and can operate offline with a pre-created data collection survey. On the last day, while at the #MpangaCFR, we practically used it to map the trees we planted. This will help us trace and monitor their growth.\n\u00a0\ud83d\udc83I highly recommend trying #Ground for tree growers and restoration initiatives.\n\nThe #NFAteam at #MpangaCFR provided us with a wealth of information about the forest, describing it as one of the ecosystems that hosts a diverse range of butterflies and bird species. As such, it's a great destination for recreational activities like bird watching and research. However, despite all these positive aspects, #MpangaCR, like many others in Uganda, is one of the most threatened areas. Its location within the Mpigi District Town Council leads to uncontrolled access, particularly from illegal loggers.\n\nThis forest was significantly impacted about ten years ago by a windstorm that uprooted trees over 100 years old, affecting half of the 400 hectares of the reserve. The reasons for this event remain unknown; thus, further research is needed. Following this loss and ongoing threats, the forest canopy is heavily gapped, and it will take over 30 years or more for it to regain its usual state. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fHow best can we assist in its recovery?\n\ud83d\udc49\u00a0I encourage #NGOs and other organisations looking to make an impact through tree planting to consider the #MpangaCFR as a key site for their initiatives.\n\n\ud83e\uddcf\u200d\u2640\ufe0fEffective communication is one of the essential aspects of sustainable forest management. Access to information enables us to make informed decisions and agree on the best solutions with various stakeholders and partners.\n\ud83e\uddbb I plan to share forest stories with the community, translating scientific and technical jargon into simple, easy to understand language. This influence starts from the inside(hearts) to the outside (hands).\n\nThank you, Eva Ntara, Roc\u00edo D\u00e1nica C\u00f3ndor-Golec, Julian Fox, the FAO Country team, #YouthGoGreenteam, Muhumuza Edwin, #NFA and #MOWE for providing this platform.

Through intense capacity-building sessions, we explored themes such as:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Participatory forest monitoring and conservation \n\ud83d\udd39 Indigenous knowledge and biodiversity\n\ud83d\udd39 Climate resilience through forest landscape restoration\n\ud83d\udd39 Opportunities for youth in sustainable forest enterprises etc\n\nWe later had a field visit to Mpanga Forest Central Reserve, a biodiversity-rich ecosystem in Mpigi District. During this visit, we translated our learning into action by planting indigenous tree species critical for restoration and local livelihoods. We also practically used FAO's Open Foris Ground mobile application to collect data on the planted species for smooth monitoring purposes.\n\nI personally planted three different tree species with significant ecological and cultural value:\n1.Warburgia ugandensis; known for its medicinal properties\n2.Prunus africana; valued for both its medicinal bark and conservation status\n3.Markhamia lutea; an important species for both shade and soil protection\nThis symbolises hope, commitment, and youth-driven action toward reversing forest loss and land degradation.\n\nI am deeply grateful to FAO and all facilitators and fellow participants who made this experience so meaningful. This workshop did not only deepen my technical knowledge, but also reaffirmed my vision for youth-led forest monitoring and environmental stewardship.\nEva Ntara Gad Okodi Theopista Abalo Bwambale Lovic Bako Patience LANDO IVAN Roc\u00edo D\u00e1nica C\u00f3ndor-Golec Julian Fox\n#AIM4Forests\n#YoungForestChampions\n\u2026 more\n\n1/15\n\n68 reactions\n68\n\n6 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n4 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nTheopista Abalo reposted this\n\nGad Okodi \u2022 2nd\n\nForester ||Young Forest Champion ||\n\n3mo \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\n#FieldDay in #MpangaCentralForest Reserve as part of the Young Forest Champions workshop in Kampala!\n\nToday, we had a field visit to Mpanga Forest, a 400-hectare gazetted central forest reserve having 29 reserves since 1932, supports an impressive and amazing biodiversity for such a small forest. It has 500 species of trees and shrubs including Celtis Spp, 300 species of birds, 97 butterflies, and 112 moths but facing significant challenges. A recent windthrow disaster of 2015 affected 200 hectares of the forest, prompting restoration efforts by the Grow partner. Recent research has revealed that the forest's soil is sandy, which could be the cause of the disturbance, however, research is needed to understand the underlying causes of these natural disasters and  ensure the forest's future sustainability. The forest's unique characteristics, with bigger trees and limited undergrowth, raise concerns about its resilience.\n\nDespite being surrounded by a human-dominated landscape and facing pressure from firewood collection and illegal tree cutting by the drum makers, Mpanga Forest remains a vital haven for biodiversity. It's renowned for its exceptional butterfly and birding opportunities and when visited at night, you can have a chance of spotting the #bushbabies . \n\nIn the field,  we also had a chance of participation in the restoration of the forest through strip planting and tree species planted include: Cordia milleni(Drum tree), Cynometra alexandria(Iron wood),  khaya anthotheca(Mahogany), Maesopsis eminii(Umbrella tree), Prunus africana(African cherry), Werbugia ugandensis(Mukuzanume,Covidex), among others. \n\nAbove all,  all these tree seedlings  planted were mapped using the skills we obtained from the training by Eva Ntara on #OpenForisGround to map trees planted by automatically taking coordinates,  tree species name,  time,  and any other relevant information after making a polygon in the app for a given restoration site for effective restoration reporting and monitoring. \n\nBesides I'm thrilled to be awarded a certificate of completion of the 3 day workshop for Young Forest Champions in Kampala Uganda and I'm grateful to the organizers like Eva Ntara Julian Fox Nadir Carolina Pallqui Camacho Roc\u00edo D\u00e1nica C\u00f3ndor-Golec and partners like national forestry authority nfa FAO World Food Forum Ndyabandiho saul Derrick Rukundo @Youth Go Green Uganda @Ministry of water and environment Uganda. \n\nWith restoration underway, it's crucial to balance conservation efforts with community needs and address the underlying causes of threats to ensure the long-term survival of this precious ecosystem.\n\nTo my fellow champions Theopista Abalo Bwambale Lovic Samuel Tahinduka Ekel Fiona Patricia Arinaitwe Margret Nabagereka Bako Patience LANDO IVAN Pius Turinawe I'm grateful to have you all. \n\n\"When we rise for forests, forests rise for us all\" Gad 2025\ud83d\ude03\n\n#AIM4Forests\n#YoungForestChampions\n\u2026 more\n\n1/10\n\n61 reactions\n61\n\n11 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n6 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\nShow all\nExperience\n\nHead of Partners Commission \n\nInternational Forestry Students'\u200b Association (IFSA) \u00b7 Part-time\n\nSep 2025 -
