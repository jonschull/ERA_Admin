At the age of 22, I ventured into entrepreneurship, building a multi-million dollar advertising agency over a decade. After successfully selling the business to a New York holding company, my trajectory shifted as I joined the M&A team, contributing to the acquisition of 19 companies within three years.\n\nWhile continuing to build and advise various ventures, I recognized that there are monumental global challenges demanding attention, such as Climate Change, World Hunger, and the imperative for a healthier planet. Motivated by a desire to make a substantial impact, I took part in commercializing and scaling a groundbreaking biotechnology company.\n\nThis journey unveiled a crucial realization\u2014the necessity for a circular project development company capable of rapidly constructing large-scale, impactful technology projects worldwide. Fueled by a sense of urgency, given the staggering number of people facing starvation daily and the alarming pace of climate change, I founded Orbital Farm in 2018.\n\nToday, Orbital Farm is actively engaged in building closed-loop systems with the potential to produce vaccines, medicines, hydrogen energy, and food on a global scale, using water, CO2, and electricity as primary resources. Our vision extends to establishing 200 circular mega projects across the planet, aiming to support and nourish billions of people on Earth while dedicating the next two decades to prototyping and developing technology for future space exploration.\n\nFor me, Orbital Farm isn't just a business; it's my life's work, my dream, and my purpose\u2014a commitment to creating a sustainable and transformative future.\n\u2026 more\n\nFeatured\n\nPost\n\nGrateful for another year & energized by the impact ahead!\n\nAs I mark my birthday today, I'm taking a moment to reflect on a year of incredible growth, learning, and, most importantly, impact. It's been a privilege to see visions turn into tangible progress, particularly in areas I'm deeply passionate about.\n\nThis past year has been rich with opportunities to drive change:\n- My speaking engagements, including at the World Summit AI last month, have been invaluable for sharing insights and fostering dialogue on critical industry advancements as we transition to a new AI world driving energy, water and systems changes globally.\n- Collaborating with the forward-thinking team at ESSA Technologies Ltd continues to be a rewarding experience and learning from brilliant scientists who deeply understand and value our natural world. \n- My involvement in Climate Week NYC, through talks and leading sessions, reinforced the urgency and opportunity in sustainable industrial development and finance to step up.\n- Spearheading initiatives in Sustainable AI datacenters has been a key focus, exploring how technology can scale responsibly \u2013 a core tenet of the work we are driving at Impactful Capital.\n- Our progress with Green Bonds, in partnership with the Climate Bonds Initiative, and the positive traction we're seeing, underscore the power of innovative finance in achieving climate goals. This strategic approach is central to how I view long-term value creation and change at global scales.\n- It's been immensely fulfilling to connect with hundreds of brilliant founders and groundbreaking technologies, and world changing projects helping them navigate the path to funding and growth. This exposure to cutting-edge innovation constantly refines my perspective. It gives me unbelievable hope and reaffirms my understanding of how solvable the challenges we are facing are today.\n- Exploring the frontiers of space technology with NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration and NIAC remains one of my favorite activities and has also been a fascinating reminder of the boundless potential of human ingenuity.\n\nThese experiences affirm my belief that strategic, informed capital can be a powerful force for good. My mission is to identify and support these transformative opportunities, and I'm incredibly proud of the strides we're making in the work, the projects and the world.\n\nThank you to my Wife and Daughter, my team members, network of colleagues, mentors, and friends who have been part of this journey. I truly value the connections with fellow leaders, investors, and innovators who share a commitment to building a more sustainable and prosperous future.\n\nI\u2019m more energized than ever for what\u2019s next and always welcome conversations with those who are passionate about shaping a truly impactful tomorrow.\n#BirthdayReflection #ImpactInvesting #SustainableFinance #Innovation #ThoughtLeadership #FamilyOffices #LimitedPartners #OrbitalFarm #ImpactfulCapital\n\n86 \u00b7 25 comments\n\nPost\n\nI am honored today to have been invited to the United Nations General Assembly #SummitoftheFuture to contribute and discuss strategies for #climateaction\n\nTogether the world is stronger, our voices have meaning and power. \n\nWe live in a world of unbelievable capabilities and potential, but we must take action towards building the future we want to live in today, and for a brighter tomorrow.\n\n178 \u00b7 17 comments\n\nPost\n\nIt was a pleasure to speak together with Kimberly Schmitke from Autum Goose Coaching (autumngoose.ca) If you're curious about learning more about Orbital Farm my perspective, and the change that we all need to drive to survive and thrive, please take a listen.

When we can unburden the geographical limitations of countries abilities to sequester carbon the lower cost, permanent sequestration places will become highly valuable, and more critically, abundantly used.\n\nBeatriz Granziera \u2022 2nd\n\nSenior Climate Policy Advisor at The Nature Conservancy\n\n2w \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\n\ud83d\udca5 We have a decision! \ud83c\udf0d The #Article6.4 Supervisory Body has just adopted the rules on #permanence, after an intense week of negotiations\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of where things landed.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Main takeaway \ud83d\udca1 : This is a much better text than what we had at the start of the week. It was #encouraging to see several countries raising their voices to keep nature in the process and to ensure that the overwhelming reaction from so many stakeholders was taken into account. There is still work to be done and challenges ahead for the participation of Nature in this mechanism, but these will be dealt with within the specific context of each activity.\n\nHere are the four main \u201cbuckets\u201d of the decision:\n\n\ud83c\udf0f Post-crediting monitoring\nThe idea of #\u201cindefinite\u201d post-crediting monitoring has been #rejected by the SBM. Instead, in the future, each #methodology (not the \u201cstandard\u201d) will determine how many years of monitoring are required \u2014 reflecting that different sectors have different monitoring needs. The Supervisory Body will still have to approve it, as it would have been the case anyway. A notable new clarification is the separation of responsibilities and liabilities after the crediting period: one for monitoring, and another for addressing reversals. This could allow a host country or third party to assume monitoring responsibilities, while the liability for remediating reversals remains with the activity participants until they can provide alternative measures to remediate reversals, such as insurance, guarantees or financial products.\n\n\ud83c\udf0f Negligible risk of reversals\nFixed numerical rates for \u201cnegligible risk\u201d were removed. Instead, the percentage defining a negligible risk will be established within each methodology and reflected in the risk assessment tool \u2014 This ensures that you define how to assess risk, BEFORE defining risk rates, which is crucial. This will be presented as a #\u201cpackage\u201d which was the original mandate and requested by many stakeholders.\n\n\ud83c\udf0f Remediation actions to address reversals\nThis section now clarifies possible \u201cexit\u201d options for projects if they fully remediate the risk of reversals: Cancelling an equivalent number of credits, or transferring risk through insurance or third-party guarantees. The Supervisory Body will provide further guidance, but it\u2019s essential that flexibility and #innovation remain central \u2014 including options like buffer pools, insurance products, and transfer of liability to third parties.\n\n\ud83c\udf0f \u201dHelp, host countries!\u201d\nA more technical but important point: when (or whether) a corresponding adjustment should be applied to units held in the buffer pool. There\u2019s a general consensus that neither the SBM nor the MEP has the authority to decide on the point of the first transfer (which triggers the corresponding adjustment). The SBM will consider the accounting implications and the application of corresponding adjustments, opening a call for inputs from host countries to gather practical guidance.\n\u2026 more\n\nScot Bryson and 3 others reacted\nScot Bryson and 3 others\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nScot Bryson \n \u2022 1st\n\nSustainable Infrastructure Architect | GP Impactful Capital | Ambassador Top Tier Impact | Space Farmer\n\n3w \u2022 \n\nThe latest EAT Lancet report of out! A moment to take stock and understand the wider systems of our food and the growing sector of emissions and the most exposed to a volatile world. We are very unprepared for the coming decades and we are not even walking at the pace needed. We should be sprinting towards a transition!\n\nWith the clear goals to make adjustments towards, I'm most excited about the increase in vegetable and legumes production! The water savings and reducing the nitrogen & phosphorus I think we'll do a great job at with the deployment of already existing better technology, monitoring and capture. \n\nI do have a deep concern with achieving our red meat & GHG emissions reductions though. This is going to be very difficult.\n\nLooking forward to hearing others perspective on this and where you see some of the near term opportunities for big wins? Who are the large firms that are the willing to make big changes in 2026? \n\nPlease tag specificly who I should connect with to help finance their transition or supply chains to enable the changes we need to achieve?\n\n#investment #greenbonds #climate #climatebonds #agriculture #food\n\u2026 more\n\nReyes Tirado \u2022 2nd\n\nGlobal Lead for Agrifood | Climate Finance & Sustainable Agriculture Expertise | Strategic Leadership in Managing Global Initiatives\n\n3w \u2022 \n\nEAT Lancet report is out today (with lots of brilliant materials for a long digestion). \n\nA quick tip.

Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines, in a discussion on how we can unlock the full potential of Ontario\u2019s mid-sized development firms\u2014the backbone of renewable energy in our province, and a key driver of Canada\u2019s leadership on the global stage.\n\nAs AI adoption accelerates and energy security becomes a top priority worldwide, the role of SME project developers has never been more critical. These are the risk-takers who transform a concept into a bankable, operating solar farm, battery storage project, or long-duration energy storage asset. They lay the groundwork for billions of dollars in infrastructure that secures our grid, powers our industries, and drives sustainable growth.\n\nYet, too often, these firms lack the financial support they need at the earliest\u2014and riskiest\u2014stages of development. Institutional investors have a vital opportunity to step up: to provide risk-aligned capital that helps projects reach bankable status and ensures Canada\u2019s track record in mining and infrastructure translates into the clean energy future.\n\nAt Impactful Capital, I am focused on championing this model here in Ontario\u2014and scaling it across North America and globally. Canadians have an outsized role to play in advancing sustainable finance, infrastructure, and AI, and it begins with empowering the developers who build the foundation.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you\u2019re an investor, policymaker, or industry leader passionate about accelerating sustainable infrastructure, I\u2019d love to connect and continue the conversation.\n#EnergyStorage #SustainableFinance #ImpactInvesting #CleanEnergy #OntarioLeadership #FutureOfEnergy #CanadianInnovation\n\u2026 more\n\nScot Bryson and 42 others reacted\nScot Bryson and 42 others\n\n5 comments\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nScot Bryson reposted this\n\nToronto Climate Week | TOCW\n\n2,683 followers\n\n1mo \u2022 \n\nBig media win \ud83d\udea8 ESG News sat down with our founder & Executive Director, Becky Park-Romanovsky, to talk about building Toronto Climate Week and Canada\u2019s role in shaping the global climate future.\n\nFrom highlighting Toronto\u2019s innovation ecosystem to Canada\u2019s leadership opportunity, this feature reinforces why October 1\u20133 matters\u2014and how TOCW is set to become a launchpad for lasting climate solutions.\n\nRead the full conversation here \u27a1\ufe0f https://lnkd.in/grmC67dr\n\n#TorontoClimateWeek #ClimateAction #Toronto\n\n\u2026 more\n\nScot Bryson and 21 others reacted\nScot Bryson and 21 others\n\n4 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nScot Bryson reposted this\n\nRandy Tyrrell \u2022 2nd\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability - Advisory Boards - Event Production - Public Speaking - Networking - Promotional Marketing\n\n1mo \u2022 \n\nSOLD OUT!!!\n\nA couple Toronto Climate Week | TOCW sessions are already full to capacity and others are close to full / sold out. \n\nClimate Creatives Hangout and Rebooting Green Business are now waitlist only.\n\nBeer & Batts and True North Rising (Opening Ceremonies) are near capacity.\nhttps://luma.com/kpztgj3l\nhttps://luma.com/t9etfsgo\n\nAll TOCW events have limited capacity.
