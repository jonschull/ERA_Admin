These trees are the age of our grandparents. We\u2019ve identified a critical 126-acre stretch of forest called \"Power Plant\" that is slated for timber auction on July 26, 2023. We must delay and ultimately stop this sale; it\u2019s scheduled to happen in just 2 days! \n\n\u201cPower Plant\u201d is a unique legacy forest case: Earth Law Center, et al. vs. DNR. Since its mature canopy and root system is located near the banks of the Elwha River, logging these old trees will impact stream flows, slope stability, and the salmon spawning in the river. Damage to the salmon triggers problems downstream for the critically endangered Southern Resident Orcas (73 left), who feed at the mouth of the river and rely on those very salmon to survive. \n\nForty-five miles long, the iconic Elwha River flows from the headwaters in the Olympic National Park to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The river received international attention when the federal government removed its two dams in 2014, allowing its waters to finally run free. Taxpayers paid $327 million to successfully restore the river, yet the State jeopardizes this progress by using outdated logging guidance and ignoring the reality of climate change and the rights of future generations.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, the Earth Law Center\u2019s Elizabeth Dunne embarked on an emergency campaign to protect Power Plant and the remaining 800 acres of legacy forest around the Elwha. Power Plant\u2019s unique facts and location may be just the catalyst to bring longer lasting protection to other critical forests in the Elwha Watershed, while also amplifying the urgent need to save legacy forests generally. This past Friday, Elizabeth and pro bono lawyer, Steven Turner, went to Court to try and delay the July sale. While the Court listened carefully to the arguments, the judge has yet to rule and the auction is still on the calendar \u2013 less than two days away. \n\nWe are incredulous that the state government has chosen to log in a watershed that the federal government and local community has worked so hard to restore. As the iconic River regenerates, it inspires many \u2013 not only Washingtonians\u2013 but people all around the world that ecosystems can restore themselves. \n\nOur immediate need is to spread the word as widely as possible and to raise funds to protect the forest. We aim to purchase the extractive timber harvest lease\u2013 essentially \"buying\" the right to protect rather than extract. So, there's no reason to log. So please:\n\n*Donate to the Elwha Forest Fund: https://lnkd.in/gWaCMi75\n*Read & forward the story: https://lnkd.in/g7DQvzcy\n*Donate to the Earth Law Center\u2019s Elwha Forest Legal Team: https://lnkd.in/etfX7C9x\n\nSince we are a 501(c)(3), your contribution will be tax deductible.\n\nFor more info: edunne@earthlawcenter.org, 808-554-1409\n\nMany thanks!\n\u2026 more\n\nElwha Forest Fund\n\ngivebutter.com\n\n15 reactions\n15\n\n2 comments\n\nLike\nComment\nShow all\nExperience\n\nChair of Board of Directors\n\nEarth Law Center \u00b7 Full-time\n\nMar 2021 - Present \u00b7 4 yrs 8 mos\n\nDurango, Colorado, United States \u00b7 Hybrid\n\n\u2022 Lead international nonprofit dedicated to advancing ecocentric law, policy, and education.\n\u2022 Participate in board & staff meetings, program development, legal analysis & strategy, publications, panel discussions, networking & fundraising.\n\u2022 Co-designed 12 virtual Earth classes for law students from newly published legal textbook Earth Law: Emerging Ecocentric Law- A Guide for Practitioners, 2021.\n\u2022 Co-designed 6-week summer internship for high school, college, and law students including legal, experiential, and advocacy training.\n\u2026 more\n\n Operations Management and Nonprofit Organizations\n\nExecutive Committee\n\nEleanor Lives! \u00b7 Part-time\n\n2019 - Present \u00b7 6 yrs 10 mos\n\nSan Francisco, California, United States\n\n\u2022 Helped grow international human rights law and advocacy group.\n\u2022 Participate in board and staff meetings, program development, publications and films, fundraising, and event planning for 75th Anniversary of UDHR.\n\u2026 more\n\nExecutive Committee, Co-Founder\n\nPlanetary Advocates \u00b7 Full-time\n\nJan 2013 - Present \u00b7 12 yrs 10 mos\n\nBerkeley, California, United States\n\n\u2022 Co-founded media based non-profit (EIN # 46-3434778) to make educational content devoted to social justice, human potential, and environmental stewardship.\n\u2022 Participated in multi-year renewable energy campaign that included national and international film festivals, conferences, demonstrations, and panel discussions.\n\u2022 Co-wrote and co-produced 3 films:\n 1) \u201cThe Future of Energy: Lateral Power to the People\u201d 62 minute crowd funded documentary about the movement to 100% renewable energy. https://youtube/Ho4OmSnezxI\n2) \u201cThe Secrets of the Climate Paradox\u201d 7 minute animated short about the psychological barriers that lead to climate inaction. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/theFutureofEnergyfilm/videos/542531312567252/\n3) \u201cCogdissonex\u201d 3 minute drug commercial parody to cure cognitive dissonance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIA_jwGq3kQ\n\u2026 more\n\nLegal Staff & Advisory Board\n\nUnite for Rights \u00b7 Contract\n\n2005 - 2019 \u00b7 14 yrs\n\nBerkeley, California, United States\n\n\u2022 Co-developed international human rights non-profit tasked with generating a global human rights charter.\n\u2022 Participated in legal analysis, grant writing, book editing & networking.\n\u2026 more\n\nFounding Partner\n\nPublic Interest Lawyers Group \u00b7 Full-time\n\n1995 - 1999 \u00b7 4 yrs\n\nSan Francisco, California, United States\n\n\u2022 Enforced violations of federal environmental laws using citizen suit provisions with emphasis on the Clean Water Act.\n\u2022 Managed complex legal case load for environmental non-profit clients.\n\u2026 more\n\nShow all\nEducation\n\nCalifornia Institute of Integral Studies\n\nDoctor of Philosophy - PhD, Doctor of Philosophy and Religion\n\n2021\n\nCalifornia Institute of Integral Studies\n\nMaster of Philosophy - MPhil, Master of Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness\n\n2014\n\nShow all\nProjects\n\nThe Future of Energy Film\n\nFeb 2013 \u2013 Present\n\nShow project\n\nThe Future of Energy: Lateral Power to the People is a positive, fun film that focuses on energy solutions and the people behind the renewable energy revolution.
