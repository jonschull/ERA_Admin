I moved to Colombia to live out my dream of helping to regenerate the earth alongside my life partner, Joe Brewer. Together, we are doing ecosystem restoration work and helping to create a local regenerative economy in our bioregion in and around Barichara. We also co-founded the Design School for Regenerating Earth where we are helping to activate bioregional organizing and facilitating learning journeys and learning exchanges between bioregions across the planet. \n\nI'm passionate about integrating and applying unified science, integral philosophy, regenerative practices, and biodynamic healing and trauma resolution to everything I do. These passions combined with my comprehensive background in operations, project management, accounting, and administration means that I bring a unique combination of heart and organizational expertise to the various initiatives and organizations in which I'm involved. \n\nPlease visit this website to learn more about the Design School for Regenerating Earth:\nhttps://design-school-for-regenerating-earth.mn.co/\n\nPlease visit this website for more information on my healing practice:\nhttps://pennyheiple.com\n\u2026 more\n\nActivity\n\n1,909 followers\n\nPosts\nComments\n\nPenny L.

This year we continued with a new one on how to organize your bioregion. These thematic areas are about practicing. Immersing ourselves in the process. Learning by doing. \n\nAnd this is exactly what the people living in the Rivers of the North Sea have been doing in earnest. Weaving with others who have similar aspirations -- like all of the different local teams who organize in collaboration with the Bioregional Weaving Labs Collective, Bioregioning South East Ireland, Korow\u00f3d Bioregional Center, Bioregional Thames, th\u00e9ra, and more.\n\nMany parallel efforts to do their local part that helps regenerate the Earth.

Current financial capital is untethered from the biophysical constraints of Earth's capacity.\n\nSays regenerative economist John Fullerton, \"I know that the current economy is driven by finance and if the economic premise of our entire global economy is in conflict with the laws of physics, we have a serious problem.\"\n\nIt\u2019s time for the Great (Re)Turning.\n\u2026 more\n\nBrian Puppa \u2022 1st\n\nExecutive Director \u2013 Legacy Project\n\n6d \u2022 \n\nSo much is happening now that it can be very disorienting. People are trying to find their bearings, trying to find a story that makes some sense and can orient them. \n \nThe co-stewards of Bioregional Earth \u2013 myself and Legacy Project Founder Susan Bosak, along with Joe Brewer and Penny L. Heiple of the Design School for Regenerating Earth \u2013 have been thinking a lot about this, and have written an article together.\n\nWe won't find what we need in the noise. \n \nThere are so many \"theories of change\" and \"transformational ideas\" out there. Somehow we've come to believe that new is better, and abstraction is a higher form of thinking. But then we can't seem to figure out how to implement all the ideas people are generating. It's because we're starting in the wrong place.\n \nWe actually need to start with what's old, and has stood the test of time. And we need to start with what's real, on the ground, right under our feet.\n \nThat's why \"bioregional\" and \"regenerative\" work can't just be the trend of the moment, but has to be understood as living into the story of Bioregional Earth in the context of The Great (Re)Turning.\n \nWe draw on many voices in our latest collaborative article. To quote just one, John Fullerton, this is an \"unfolding, filled with mystery and even magic. It cannot be achieved, only facilitated and participated in.\"\n \nCheck out the whole article about The Great (Re)Turning:\nhttps://lnkd.in/g4puCp-E\n\u2026 more\n\n7 reactions\n7\n\n1 repost\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nPenny L.

This article recounts their extraordinary journeys. It is a delight. \n\nNext Thursday, 23rd October, 4pm GMT, in the Design School for Regenerating Earth, Elyes Mkacher and myself with the Western European Atlantic Coastal BioRegion will be holding a 1-hour celebration of the #BirdNations as BioRegional Ambassadors.\n\nThe #BirdNations connect our #BioRegions, and whilst we can often spend time \"defining\" those regions, it is important to remember that a BioRegion is never isolated \u2013 there may be a watershed or a specific ecozone, but, for example, the Western European Atlantic Coastal BioRegion is deeply connected to the region of the #GulfOfMexico, the warm saline waters that will then speed across the Atlantic and warm our region... Many of our #BirdNations \u2013 as this article beautifully illustrates \u2013 migrate from one BioRegion to another, as they overwinter in one region, and oversummer elsewhere. Watching animations of bird migrations enables us to visualise the to-and-fro movements that contribute to our planetary home. \n\nPlease join us in the Design School for Regenerating Earth next Thursday, for this Inter-BioRegional Event. If you would like to join us please use this link. Membership of the school is $5 a month \u2013 a truly great $5 for all the amazingness that the School brings together.

A multi-talented cultural ecologist, designer and artist living on a houseboat in Devizes, UK, Pete hosts the Western European Atlantic Coastal BioRegion in the Design School for Regenerating Earth, and brings his vast depth of cultural and ecological knowledge to the healing and regenerative work of his new initiative, #RootToReef.\n\nPete's work is imbued with the values of Earthcare and respect for people, animals, ecosystems and the planet. His approach is rooted in ecological restoration and human connection.\n\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, Pete shared a taste of his storytelling artistry. As bioregional efforts are often focused on rivers and watersheds, Pete saw the need to complement this with a stronger awareness of coastal perspectives. His bi-weekly seminars in the Design School weave fascinating, thoughtful and deeply researched perspectives on the lifeways and social ecological dynamics of sea grasses, wild horses, oysters, saltmarshes, coastal ancestors, ancient folklore and more. \n\nStoryMoss loved collaborating with Pete in our recent coverage of the r3.0 conference, where he wrote thoughtful and thought-provoking reflections on the Seeqanam\u00e2hsak game of the herring, or \"Spring Fish\": https://lnkd.in/dgaDe3nW\n\nAnd on Dr. Lyla June Johnston's keynote presentation on Indigenous, Regenerative BioRegional Design: https://lnkd.in/dQk_rWBu\n\nPete even designed our StoryMoss logo!!\n\nDr. Pete Jeffs \ud83d\udc34 also recently authored the beautiful, soulful and inspiring #BirdsOfSpirit e-book, a celebration of the Bird Nations with original drawings and indigenous lore, inspired by the wisdom of each species: https://lnkd.in/dGXsERRY\n\nIn a few days, we're excited to share Pete's latest writing reflecting on \"A Murder of Crows\" - birds and language!\n\nVanessa Farr Emmanuelle Chiche Manda Scott Joe Brewer Penny L.

As Maria-Elena and Marie-Angel surface in this beautiful conversation, French bioregionalism has its own distinct cultural root, and offers a powerful opportunity to revisit history and ancestry, and co-envision thriving rural futures grounded in deep connection to the land.\n\nAs Media Partner for the @r3.0 conference, StoryMoss will continue to share stories of bioregional learning and activation in the coming weeks and months!\n\nThera website: https://thera.earth/\n\nEnjoy the conversation!\n\nThanks to the StoryMoss team: Emmanuelle Chiche Dr. Pete Jeffs \ud83d\udc34Dr Karen Lemke, PDC Salvador Perez David Burman\n\nBill Baue Ralph Thurm Design School for Regenerating Earth Penny L.
