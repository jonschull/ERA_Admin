I am interested in work that is founded on the mitigation of anthropogenic issues and the reversal of global ecological vulnerability, while also having a strong desire to garner excellence in K-12 public schools (i.e. academic coaching). I am eagerly receptive to any requisite training or certification and willing to adapt to roles that diversify my skill set. My interests include public education, multiculturalism, data analysis, permaculture, biodiversity alignment, sustainable infrastructure, phytoremediation, and applications of biomimicry and biogeochemical cycles. I have a passion for high leverage approaches to problem solving, and I aspire to coordinate projects and personnel as a means to collaboratively regain informed stewardship of our youth and our environment.\n\nPlease see my resume uploaded to my profile.

India\u2019s stone paper market is experiencing rapid growth: it generated $58.7 million in revenue in 2024 and is projected to more than double by 2033, driven by demand for sustainable packaging and labeling. Indian manufacturers such as Bonafide Exp, Crest Container Line Pvt Ltd, Damco India Pvt Limited, Noble Industries, and Sumela Exp Pvt Ltd are actively producing stone paper, primarily for packaging uses.\n\nKevin Gesseau and 779 others reacted\nKevin Gesseau and 779 others\n\n20 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n41 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\n\nSarah Herzog reposted this\n\nSam Knowlton \n \u2022 Following\n\nFounder & Managing Director at SoilSymbiotics\n\n1yr \u2022 \n\nWhen Europeans arrived in North America, up to 60 million bison roamed the great plains.\n\nThese iconic grazers turned the prairie soils into a deep carbon sponge, vibrant with biological activity.\n\nOften overlooked in this story is the vast diversity of plants carpeting the plains.\n\nThe great plains are home to ~ 3,000 plant species, most of which are grasses and forbs grazed by bison.\n\nMany of these plants feature massive and intricate root systems that makeup around 90% of the plant's total biomass.\n\nThe top 4-6 feet of soil is full of roots.\n\nEach plant species has a unique root architecture to ensure its space amongst all the other roots in the soil. \n\nPlant roots supply a blend of sugars, enzymes, organic acids, phenols, and other compounds that recruit and sustain specific soil microbes based on the plants' needs.\n\nThe greater the diversity of plants, the greater the diversity of roots and microbes, and the more robust the below and aboveground ecosystems. \n\nAs an example of the profound cycle of life, the bison catalyzed life within the soil that in turn bolstered its own existence.\n\u2026 more\n\n511 reactions\n511\n\n46 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n65 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nRegenerative Agriculture Industry Network\n\nSarah Herzog \u2022 1st\n\n1yr \u2022 \n\nReposted... 50-80% water savings.\n\nSam Knowlton \n \u2022 Following\n\nFounder & Managing Director at SoilSymbiotics\n\n1yr \u2022 \n\nRajendra Singh, also known as the waterman of India, led efforts to build 14,000 water harvesting structures that capture 1.3 billion liters of water each year, turning water-scarce regions of India into oases.\n\nHis work has revitalized more than a dozen \"dead\" rivers, recharged depleted water tables, and ensured water security for 1,500 Indian villages.\n\nRajendra and the organization he heads, Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS), have helped implement efficient irrigation strategies and water harvesting on more than 5,000 farms, achieving a 50-80% water savings and a 20-30% increase in farmer income.\n\nThe abundance of captured water has allowed for a massive afforestation effort.

How will new technologies look in the future, and how can we ensure that life is respected while we simultaneously aim to harness its seemingly effortless power and complexity?\n\nSam Knowlton \n \u2022 Following\n\nFounder & Managing Director at SoilSymbiotics\n\n1yr \u2022 \n\nThis video shows real-time carbon flows inside a mycorrhizal network. \n\nMycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic relationship with ~ 90% of terrestrial plants and have done so for 400 million years.\n\nThese specialized fungi provide plants with nutrients and water in exchange for carbon-based exudates the plant produces through photosynthesis. \n\nCurrent estimates say that between 4 and 20 percent of all CO2 pulled in by plants ends up stored in mycorrhizal tissues. \n\nConsidering plants need to build an entire above-ground structure, a root system, and produce flowers, fruits, and seeds, this is an astounding amount of carbon to allocate to mycorrhizal biomass. \n\nA recent review study estimates that global plant communities transfer 13.1 gigatons of CO2 to the underground mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi each year \u2013 equivalent to roughly 1/3 of annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. \n\nThe amount of time the carbon is locked up in fungi\u2019s mycelium remains unknown. Nonetheless, the influx of such a massive amount of carbon into the soil is a boon for soil ecology, nutrient cycling, and the health of water cycles. \n\nIt is no wonder the formation of terrestrial ecosystems largely started with the mycorrhizal fungi/plant partnership. \n\nVideo credit: Rachael Cargill\n\u2026 more\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nSarah Herzog \u2022 1st\n\nInstructional/Academic Coaching, STEM, Public Education, Stewardship, Change agency,\n Ecological restoration, Climate mitigation\n\n1yr \u2022 \n\nStudent-led project with Outdoor Club: transforming an underutilized green space  at the front of the school into an urban tough, multi-use, and ecologically-sound sanctuary to welcome students, staff, visitors, and local wildlife! #urbantough #stewardship #urbanag #plantnative #ecorestoration\n\n1/4\n\n0 \n\n1 comment\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\nShow all\nExperience\n\nScience Department Chair\n\nRochester City School District \u00b7 Full-time\n\nSep 2023 - Present \u00b7 2 yrs 2 mos\n\nRochester, New York, United States\n\n Analytical Skills, Communication and +10 skills\n\nEducation\n\nEdinboro University of Pennsylvania - School of Graduate Studies\n\nMaster's degree, Educational Leadership and Administration, General\n\nAug 2018 \u2013 Aug 2019\n\nEdinboro University of Pennsylvania - School of Graduate Studies\n\nEducator Preparation Program, Secondary Education and Teaching\n\nAug 2015 \u2013 May 2017\n\nGrade: A\n\n Lesson Planning, Multicultural Education and +1 skill\n\nShow all\nSkills\n\nProblem Solving\n\nScience Department Chair at Rochester City School District\n\nEndorse\n\nPresentations\n\nEndorse\nShow all\nInterests\nTop Voices\nCompanies\nGroups\nNewsletters\nSchools\n\nKatharine Hayhoe \n\n\u00b7 2nd\n\nClimate Scientist | Distinguished Professor, Texas Tech | Chief Scientist, The Nature Conservancy | Author, SAVING US | LinkedIn Top Voice\n\n239,438 followers\n\nFollowing\n\nBill Gates \n\n\u00b7 3rd\n\nChair, Gates Foundation and Founder, Breakthrough Energy\n\n39,125,853 followers\n\nFollowing\n\nPeople also viewed\n\nDurgaprasad Budhwani \n\n\u00b7 2nd\n\nFounder & Innovator | Empowering Productivity with AI Assistants for LinkedIn, WhatsApp & Twitter | Driving User Engagement & Community Growth\n\nFollow\n\nDr. Jason B.
