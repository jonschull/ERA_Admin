Sarah was one of the victims of the tragic shooting at a Jewish Museum in Washington DC.\nSarah graduated with a BS in Environmental Studies from KU. She was a remarkable individual, deeply committed to fostering peace and cooperation. Her honors thesis focused on peace efforts between Israeli and Palestinian organizations, and she continued her studies at American University, including time at the University of Peace in Costa Rica.\nSarah's dedication to making the world a better place was evident in all she did. She was a wonderful person and employee, and her influence extended far beyond her time at KU. Her passion for environmental studies and peace efforts inspired many, and her loss is deeply felt by all who knew her.\nWe extend our heartfelt condolences to Sarah's family, friends, and all who were touched by her kindness and commitment to positive change. Her legacy will continue to inspire us.\n\u2026 more\n\n232 reactions\n232\n\n5 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n4 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nScott Schulte \n \u2022 2nd\n\nAssociate Professor of the Practice, KU Edwards Campus\n\n5mo \u2022 \n\nIt's a wrap!

Much of my career has involved water resources planning, design, and project implementation that make our  communities safer and more resilient and restore our natural resources. \n\nAndy Sauer \n \u2022 2nd\n\nCreating Smart Stormwater Solutions at Burns & McDonnell\n\n7mo \u2022 \n\nLast Wednesday, WEF and nine other national water professional organizations sent a letter to Lee Zeldin, Administrator of the EPA, regarding the impacts of reducing funding to the EPA and more importantly to state funding programs that are the backbone of water infrastructure improvements. Without clean safe drinking water, proper wastewater systems, and effective stormwater management controls we will not be a prosperous country where we can feel safe to drink the water, flush a toilet, or drive across a stream. Water is the foundation of cultures, and we are eroding our ability to just maintain what water infrastructure we have not to mention trying to make it more modern and cost effective for the next generation. Cutting funding to basic water infrastructure is not how we make America Great. \n\nLetter to EPA March 12 2025\n\n2 pages\n\n1 / 2\n\n0\n\n16 reactions\n16\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nScott Schulte \n \u2022 2nd\n\nAssociate Professor of the Practice, KU Edwards Campus\n\n7mo \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nAnother very good day to be out of the office/classroom/lab with Dr. Robert Hagen and KU Edwards Campus and Lawrence KU Environmental Studies Field Ecology students, setting up wildlife cameras at the Overland Park Arboretum. #KUINKC #EVRN \n\n1/3\n\n79 reactions\n79\n\n1 repost\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\nShow all\nExperience\n\nThe University of Kansas\n\n10 yrs 3 mos\n\nAssociate Professor of the Practice\n\nFull-time\n\nJul 2022 - Present \u00b7 3 yrs 4 mos\n\nOverland Park, Kansas, United States\n\nI am a Professor of the Practice in the Environmental Assessment Professional Science Masters and the undergraduate Environmental Studies degree completion programs where I teach undergraduate and graduate students and mentor students in capstone projects.

When it\u2019s compared to regions across the country, it's in an enviable position because its quality of life is high and backed by strong neighborhoods, a solid economy, and low cost of living. Still, the region faces serious socio-economic disparities (areas of concentrated poverty and housing segregation) and challenges (projected major demographic shifts) that will test the region\u2019s resiliency. Community leaders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors are already taking steps through Heartland 2050, the Omaha/Council Bluff\u2019s region\u2019s first regional vision plan, to connect its more vulnerable communities to educational and economic opportunities. Residents want to ensure that the region continues to thrive and becomes a place where people of all walks of life have the opportunity to live, work, play and contribute. \n\u2026 more\n\nOther contributors\n\nView all contributors\nSkills\n\nEnvironmental Awareness\n\n69 endorsements\n\nEndorsed by Jennifer Ronk and 2 others who are highly skilled at this\n\nSustainability\n\n27 endorsements\n\nEndorsed by Otavio Silva who is highly skilled at this\n\nShow all\nRecommendations\nReceived\nGiven\n\nNothing to see for now\n\nRecommendations that Scott receives will appear here.\n\nInterests\nTop Voices\nCompanies\nGroups\nNewsletters\nSchools\n\nMohamed El-Erian \n\n\u00b7 3rd\n\nFinance, Economics Expert\n\n2,612,886 followers\n\nFollow\n\nRichard Branson \n\n\u00b7 3rd\n\nFounder at Virgin Group\n\n18,674,191 followers\n\nFollow\nShow all\n\nPeople also viewed\n\nTom Jacobs \n\n\u00b7 2nd\n\nChief Resilience Officer at Mid-America Regional Council\n\nConnect\n\nAshley Z.
