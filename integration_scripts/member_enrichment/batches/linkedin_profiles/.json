A holistic approach to water conservation is essential, as it recognises that protecting water resources means safeguarding both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Such a systematic approach ensures the resilience of both natural environments and human communities in the face of growing environmental challenges.\n\nI\u2019m interested in leveraging my unique blend of geospatial analysis, statistical modeling, and ecological expertise to provide innovative solutions in water related issues such as :\n\n- Water Resources Management and Restoration of Water Resources\n- Climate Resilience and Ecosystem-Based Adaptation\n- Nature Restoration and Holistic Basin/Watershed Land-use Management\n\nWith experience from both research and consulting, I\u2019m committed to bridging the gap between research and practical application. \n\nLet's connect to explore how we can work together to solve water challenges and build a more resilient, sustainable future!\n\u2026 more\n\nTop skills\n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management \u2022 Geospatial Data \u2022 Aquatic Ecology \u2022 Statistical Modeling \u2022 Project Management\n\nExperience\n\nEnvironmental Adviser\n\nRamboll \u00b7 Full-time\n\nJan 2024 - Present \u00b7 1 yr 10 mos\n\nOslo, Norway \u00b7 Hybrid\n\nAquatic Ecology | Water Framework Directive | Water Monitoring Programs | Environmental Impact Assessments | Biodiversity Metrics/Nature Accounting | Project Management | Environmental Mitigation Measures and Action Plans\n\u2026 more\n\n Geospatial Data\n\nOwner and CEO\n\nEcofluent AS\n\nJan 2022 - Present \u00b7 3 yrs 10 mos\n\nNorway\n\nEcofluent is committed to conserve and sustainably manage our water resources.\n\n Integrated Water Resources Management, Participatory Approaches and +4 skills\n\nResearcher\n\nNatural History Museum, University of Oslo\n\nOct 2020 - Sep 2023 \u00b7 3 yrs\n\nOslo, Oslo, Norway\n\nResearcher in the Geo-Ecology (GEco) research group mainly working on developing Nature in Norway (Natur i Norge, NiN), a mapping and classification system incorporating all nature in Norway.\n\n Geospatial Data\n\nUniversity Lecturer\n\nThe Oslo School of Architecture and Design  \u00b7 Part-time\n\nAug 2022 - Dec 2022 \u00b7 5 mos\n\nOslo, Norway\n\nTeaching landscape architecture students how to incorporate ecological principles into their landscape designs.\n\nResearcher \n\nInstitute of Marine Research (IMR), Norway\n\nDec 2016 - Mar 2022 \u00b7 5 yrs 4 mos\n\nFl\u00f8devigen, Norway\n\nI was involved in a range of different projects (among others): \n* Developing a statistical model for the spatial distribution of kelp forest along the Norwegian coast\n* Testing and developing marine NiN (Nature in Norway), a classification system aiming at describing all nature in Norway\n\u2026 more\n\n Geospatial Data\n\nShow all\nEducation\n\nUniversitetet i Oslo (UiO)\n\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD), Marine Ecology\n\n2007 \u2013 2013\n\n Geospatial Data\n\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica del Norte\n\nMaster of Science (MS), Marine Ecology\n\n2000 \u2013 2004\n\nShow all\nLicenses & certifications\n\nMEAL DPro Course\n\nPyramide Learning\n\nIssued Jun 2024\n\n MEAL, Adaptive Learning and +1 skill\n\nProject DPro Course\n\nPyramide Learning\n\nIssued May 2024\n\n Project Management, Project Planning and +1 skill\n\nShow all\nVolunteering\n\nVolunteer\n\nCooling the Climate\n\nFeb 2025 - Present \u00b7 9 mos\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe \"Cooling the Climate\" initiative is a comprehensive strategy aimed at restoring the Amazon rainforest, a critical component of the Earth's climate system. With the rainforest facing severe threats from deforestation, the project emphasises halting destructive practices, restoring degraded land, and promoting sustainable regenerative methods. By leveraging innovative financing and technology, the initiative seeks to direct significant investment into reforestation efforts, ultimately driving both environmental restoration and economic transformation in the Global South. The use of technology is essential, enabling widespread participation in regenerating ecosystems and fostering a connection between rural development and global health.\n\u2026 more\n\nProsjektleder\n\nNeeds4Water\n\nApr 2024 - Dec 2024 \u00b7 9 mos\n\nHealth\n\nWater, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in schools project in Ethiopia.\nThe Needs4Water WASH survey project aims to evaluate and improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure in 25 schools across five Ethiopian regions: Addis Ababa, Oromia, Somali, South West Ethiopia, and South Ethiopia. The project seeks to assess water quality, sanitation facilities, menstrual hygiene management, and hygiene promotion, providing actionable recommendations to ensure a safe and healthy learning environment for students. Expected outcomes include improved WASH conditions, enhanced student health, and educational benefits, with potential for scaling up the project.\n\u2026 more\n\nShow all\nSkills\n\nMEAL\n\nMEAL DPro Course\n\nEndorse\n\nAdaptive Learning\n\nMEAL DPro Course\n\nEndorse\nShow all\nRecommendations\nRecommend Thijs Christiaan\nReceived\nGiven\n\nNothing to see for now\n\nRecommendations that Thijs Christiaan receives will appear here.\n\nPublications\n\nNatur i Norge - Variasjon satt i system\n\nUniversitetsforlaget \u00b7 Mar 13, 2024\n\nShow publication\n\nNorge har sv\u00e6rt stor naturvariasjon.
