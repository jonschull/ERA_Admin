In this post I summarize supporting observations. Let me know what I missed. \n\u00a0\nThe theory explains persistent high rainfall within forested continents\u2014contrasting with the approximately exponential declines seen with distance inland in open regions [1]. It explains why this effect, noted in Siberia's summer, disappears during winters when transpiration ceases [2]. It predicts the erosion of precipitation and reliability following deforestation and land-cover changes, as observed in Brazil and Australia [3,4].\n\u00a0\nThe theory addresses why untuned climate simulations fail to account for around half of observed Amazonian discharge rates, with general circulation models predicting average rainfalls of ~1.0\u20131.2 mm/day versus actual ~2.1 mm/day [5]. It explains the atmospheric convergence seen over the Amazon [6,7], and also how these cooler forests pull in winds off a warmer ocean contrary to conventional expectation [8,9]. It explains the abrupt monsoon onsets that conventional climate models fail to replicate [10,11], and predicts the observed high pre-rainfall atmospheric pressure in tropical South America [9]. It also aligns with studies finding that ~70% of Amazon precipitation is transported from outside the region [12,13].\n\u00a0\nThe mechanisms have relevance beyond vegetation cover. Analyses of tropical tropospheric pressure and temperature profiles reveal that observed spatial and temporal variations in sea level pressure relative to mean tropospheric temperature align more closely with Biotic Pump predictions than with standard models  [14].\n\u00a0\nThe physical principles also refine cyclone thermodynamics, linking storm power to rainfall measures\u2014consistent with observations of hurricane intensification correlating with condensation rates [15,16]. They connect global circulation power to theory by linking condensation to available energy and observations [17]. More speculatively, the biotic pump illuminates diurnal precipitation cycles and moisture-advection feedbacks along low-level jets, supported by data showing afternoon rainfall peaks over forests tied to transpiration-driven transport [18,8].\n\u00a0\nThere are various ad-hoc explanations and claims for some of these phenomena. But the Biotic Pump provides a unified explanation.\n\nAnastassia Makarieva\n#WUR #CIFOR #Ecorestoration #BioticPump #ClimateScience #Forests #Deforestation #ClimateModeling #ConservationScience\n\u2026 more\n\nPhilip Bogdonoff and 44 others reacted\nPhilip Bogdonoff and 44 others\n\n9 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n7 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nDouglas Sheil \n \u2022 1st\n\nProf at Wageningen University and Research\n\n4d \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nFairy Trees and Fig Spirits\u2014A Halloween Reflection\n\u00a0\nAs a child in Ireland, I enjoyed paging through nature field guides with their pictures and accounts of birds, wildflowers and shells. I remember finding a copy of W.B. Yeats\u2019s \"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry\" and finding that he had written, what read like, a field guide to the diversity of Ireland\u2019s unseen beings: fairies, goblins, and other spirits who might bless or curse those who crossed their paths. The presentation was serious and offered a glimpse into an even richer world where there was no clear boundary between natural and supernatural. Even today, there are Irish trees that are protected by their association with spirits.\n\u00a0\nSuch sensibilities aren\u2019t unique to Ireland. In my research in various parts of the planet, I\u2019ve often found similar beliefs: with trees, forests and landscapes having their own rich folklore and magic. In our recent paper, led by Ditro Wibisono Wardi Parikesit, we explored how an Iban community in West Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) see large strangler figs as hosting various types of demons and spirit beings \u2014 some benevolent, others unpredictable and dangerous. One, the \"antu grasi\" or hunter ghost, is especially feared and celebrated. Their trees are never cut, and the space around them becomes a refuge for forest wildlife.\n\u00a0\nFor me that\u2019s what Halloween, or Samhain as it was known in Ireland, celebrates: it is about nature and the moment when the worlds of the living, the dead, and the imagination overlap, and when we acknowledge the spirits that keep the world in balance.\n\u00a0\nHere is the new article (open access): https://lnkd.in/e4XmNb8n .\n\n#WUR #CIFOR #IndigenousKnowledge #Conservation #Indonesia #Borneo #Biodiversity #Forest #Swidden #land #Halloween #Ireland #Samhain #Ficus\n\u2026 more\n\nAse Johannessen, PhD and 21 others reacted\nAse Johannessen, PhD and 21 others\n\n7 comments\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nDouglas Sheil reposted this\n\nLiza MURPHY \n \u2022 2nd\n\nExpert in global issues regarding assurance, sustainable commodities,supply chains, design and implementation of market development strategies, biodiversity credits, economic inclusion and multistakeholder engagement.\n\n1w \u2022 Edited \u2022 \n\nThis is a helpful discussion and a useful reminder that complex problems cannot be discussed, or resolved, with simple slogans.

It\u2019s a powerful claim and has been widely repeated in various forms and contexts. But have you seen the evidence? Is the claim outdated or perhaps a myth?\n\u00a0\nOur new study, led by Emily Meijaard, examined this widely repeated claim for selected supermarkets in the UK, the Netherlands, and Australia.  We found that only about 8% of products that are in categories that potentially include vegetable oils, explicitly list palm oil, though up to 40% might contain it nonetheless. \n\nSo was the 50% claim ever justified? We discuss this and related implications in the article. In brief: we need evidence but poor transparency is an obstacle.\n\nThe study is open access here: https://lnkd.in/e7dSqQnE\n\nErik Meijaard Kimberly Carlson @SyahmiZaini\n#PalmOil #Sustainability #MythBusting #EvidenceBasedPolicy #Transparency #SustainableChoices #Research #WUR #IUCN\n\u2026 more\n\n27 reactions\n27\n\n1 comment\n\n\u2022\n\n4 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nDouglas Sheil reposted this\n\nThe TreeMap\n\n2,472 followers\n\n1w \u2022 \n\n1.14 Million Hectares of Nickel Concessions Now Mapped on Nusantara Atlas\n\nThe TreeMap has recently published the updated nickel mining concession layer on Nusantara Atlas which covers 1.14 million hectares of Indonesia\u2019s terrestrial and coastal zones.

This olive oil? That sunflower oil? That other one claiming \"palm oil free\"? Despite years working with the IUCN Palm Oil Task Force (report here https://lnkd.in/ea55DA-W) and more recently the IUCN Oil Crops Task Force (report https://lnkd.in/ebX9JNsS), I still don\u2019t know and can't find the information I need to make well informed choices. That's a problem.\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s the question?\n\nLikely you have heard stories about the evil of palm oil and the wonders of coconut or olive. Most of these stories focus on the crops not the real villains. Our concern shouldn't be \"which type of oil crop is good or bad?\" but rather for the specific oils we consider buying ... \"how was it produced and what are the implications?\"\n\nIn our new paper (see https://lnkd.in/evFmanDA), by @Erik Meijaard, @Malika Virah-Sawmy, and myself, we challenge the simplified narratives that dominate vegetable oil discussions. The reality? All oil crops can be linked to conservation concerns, to environmental impacts and even in many cases to shocking human rights abuses. It depends where and how they're grown, processed and brought to market.\n\u00a0\nThe crop isn't the problem but practices are.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? Informed decisions should not rely on us doing the searching\u2014that\u2019s hard. Currently most information is simplistic, partial and reflects vested interests. Regulatory and policy interventions are essential to enforce ethical production as the standard rather than the exception. Businesses and governments must also work together to remove barriers that make responsible choices more costly or inaccessible.\n\nWe need transparency across the entire vegetable oil sector, not selective scrutiny of tropical oils while temperate crops get a free pass. We need to look at impact, rights, and governance\u2014not just which plant the oil came from. Until then we're guessing.\n\n#WUR #IUCN #Sustainability #FoodSystems #VegetableOils #PalmOil #Conservation #SupplyChainTransparency\n\u2026 more\n\nNiels Werdenberg and 113 others reacted\nNiels Werdenberg and 113 others\n\n16 comments\n\n\u2022\n\n9 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nDouglas Sheil reposted this\n\nErik Meijaard \n \u2022 2nd\n\nManaging Director at Borneo Futures Sdn Bhd\n\n2w \u2022 \n\nNow online.\n\nWhat do we really know about oil crops?\n\nHow well does our consumption align with our values?\n\nWhat do product labels not disclose... but should.\n\nHave a look at our provocative essay on this complex issue, and let us know what you think.\n\nDouglas Sheil\n\u2026 more\n\nNo oil crop is inherently bad\u2014But our thinking might be\n\ncell.com\n\nRobert Nasi and 31 others reacted\nRobert Nasi and 31 others\n\n1 comment\n\n\u2022\n\n11 reposts\n\nLike\nComment\nRepost\nSend\n\nDouglas Sheil reposted this\n\nKoen van Seijen \u2022 Following\n\nManager at Toniic, host of the Podcast Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food\n\n2w \u2022 \n\n\ud83d\udca6 Why fixing #water fixes #carbon?\nWater is at the heart of so many of our planetary challenges from carbon to #biodiversity to #food production. When we restore #watercycles,\u00a0carbon becomes easier to store,\u00a0trees can thrive across larger landscapes, and\u00a0biodiversity rebounds.\nWe often think of these as separate issues, but they\u2019re deeply connected through water. Yet, there\u2019s still a lot of\u00a0misinformation\u00a0out there.\nOne of the most common myths is that\u00a0trees always use water, therefore trees always cost water. It\u2019s true if you plant large eucalyptus stands in dry areas, they can deplete local water tables. But that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nTrees also\u00a0create #rain,\u00a0recycle #moisture, and\u00a0cool\u00a0the #land.\nThey can increase #rainfall downwind, enhance #soil infiltration, and sustain streams that would otherwise disappear. We\u2019ve known this for a long time \u2014 but we haven\u2019t emphasized it enough. When we see trees as part of the water system, not just as water consumers, we start to understand how\u00a0restoring vegetation\u00a0is also\u00a0restoring the hydrology\u00a0that sustains life.\nIt\u2019s not trees\u00a0or\u00a0water.\nIt\u2019s trees\u00a0for\u00a0water. \n\nThe conversation with Douglas Sheil, professor at Wageningen University & Research is now OUT!
