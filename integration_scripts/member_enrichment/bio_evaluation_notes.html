Founder and Thought Leader, Annapurna Abundance: Learning to Regenerate while Regenerating to Learn
https://www.youtube.com/@annapurnaabundance5693

Founding Core Faculty
Doctoral Program in Visionary Practice and Regenerative Leadership
Southwestern College, Santa Fe, New Mexico
https://www.swc.edu/pramod-parajuli-ph-d-program-faculty/

As a trans-disciplinary social scientist, scholar and educator, Dr. Parajuli is deeply seeking ways to heal and regenerate lifesystems, livelihoods, learning and leadership during this turbulent period (especially since 2020) of what he identifies as the “Combined Climate/Coronaviruses Disruptions” (CCCDs).  He recognizes CCCDs as a valid and unavoidable response of Gaia to give us the mirror to reassess ourselves and our pathways. Where and how the human world has caused the deep erosion into its own pathways? Why and how are our pathways at the detriment of the bio-geo-chemical cycles? Responding to such an urgent situation he is engaged and invites others to deeply explore both the “epochal” and “epical” dimensions of this moment. Clearly impacting from cellular to cosmic, at this juncture, the message is clear: 
HUMANITY is NOT at the center. LIFE, LIFESYSTEMS and WEBS of LIFE which envelop the ecosphere and every species on earth, ARE. 

Professor Parajuli’s engaged pedagogies and scholarship are thus guided by the premise that at this critical juncture, the choices humanity has is between: “Upcycling to Regenerative,” or by default, “Downcycling to Degenerative.” What we do now is entirely upon us. Our ecospheric home (the Gaia) is already doing and will do what she needs to do. Gaia has endured long enough of our excesses and there is no room for us to continue the run-away extraction and plunder of the earthly processes.

 A passionate educator/advisor, professor Parajuli has designed 2 Masters and 2 doctoral programs while successfully graduating 37 doctoral advisees and about 70 Masters students who are pioneering regenerative pedagogies and leadership work throughout the world. A graduate of Stanford in education, anthropology, and political ecology (1983-1990), he has taught at Stanford, Syracuse U (1991-98), Lewis and Clark College (1998-99), International Honors Program (1999-2000), Portland State (2001-2008), Prescott College (2008-2020), and Southwestern College (2020-). He is also active in the networks of Ubiquity University, Ecoversities, and the Regenerative Communities Network (RCN). 

At Portland State (PSU), he designed and developed an interdisciplinary Master’s program, Leadership in Ecology, Culture and Learning and also co-initiated Learning Gardens program. One of his proudest contributions, through the award-winning Learning Gardens initiative, his team actualized the promise of connecting the university with K-12 landscape and the collectivity of children and youth, teachers and their parents. In this award-winning program, children and youth not only learn how to garden but they gardened to learn. A pleasant surprise for all, they gardened to learn every subject, almost grade-by-grade, topic-by-topic, week-by-week, and subject-by-subject. At PSU, he also nurtured another national award-winning innovation on the theme of Schools as Ecosystems. In this online learning platform, children and youth could turn their schools as living-learning laboratories and engage in 36 plus design and regenerative activities. 

In 2008, he moved to the high desert of Colorado Plateau to start a new phase and engage at Prescott College. He embraced and embodied, another ecosystem, another reality. Here he served as the Core faculty for the PhD program in sustainability education and offered leadership in designing and developing new graduate programs. 
A prolific writer and thought leader in pedagogical, social and applied sciences, Dr. Parajuli has coined and contributed the notions of integrative socio-ecological regeneration (ISER), “social movement pedagogy,” “critique of development discourse,” “ecological ethnicities,” “bio-cultural diversities,” “soil-to supper/sustenance pedagogies,” “permaculture household,” “Gandhian environmentalism,” “environmentalism of the global south,” “Annapurna pluriversities” and “regenerative abundance.” Dr. Parajuli has published widely in the intersection of pedagogy, political ecology, food systems, and social sciences.  He is the co-editor of the volume, Religion and Sustainable Agriculture (2016).

<div class="bio">As Founder and Director of Firmrock Agri-Water Initiative, I am committed to driving sustainable agricultural practices that address the core challenges of hunger, water scarcity, and poverty in Kenya's arid and semi-arid regions. Our mission is to empower local communities by providing innovative farming techniques, water management solutions, and value-added agriculture that promote both economic growth and food security.

We are currently launching a large-scale cassava and sweet potato farming project, beginning with a 5-acre demonstration hub and training 50 local farmers to replicate this model on their ½-acre plots 

 This initiative not only focuses on cultivating drought-resistant crops but also incorporates value addition by processing cassava and sweet potatoes into flour and starch. We take a zero-waste approach, converting by-products like pulp and peels into animal feed to ensure resource efficiency.

 In addition, we are exploring the potential of sweet potato leaves for plant-based protein extraction, an exciting venture that could boost both nutrition and economic opportunities for the community.

 At Firmrock, our focus extends beyond agriculture. We are tackling the root causes of hunger, water shortages, and poverty by building resilient, self-sustaining communities.
 
 We are actively seeking partnerships and resources to scale this initiative and broaden our impact. If you're passionate about sustainable agriculture, innovative solutions, or community empowerment, I’d love to connect and explore how we can collaborate to create lasting change.</div>

I have worked for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Geneva from 2000 to 2021, addressing global environmental issues. Linking global interests and goals with local actions, especially in the form of regenerative agriculture inspired by permaculture, is one of my main concerns. I am co-author of the book "Die Humusrevolution" and initiator of the symposium and webinar series "Ressource building Agriculture". I am living in the ecovillage/community Schloss Tempelhof since the end of 2012, where I also help to shape purely practical methods of regenerative agriculture.

I dedicate my career to expanding the social impact of third sector organizations, aligning the different visions of the areas and actors around a common purpose. I structure resources and operations helping to make each institution more efficient and sustainable.

I have worked in strategic positions in some of the main institutions in Brazil, accumulating valuable knowledge along the way.

I have achieved significant results in different contexts, ranging from the multiplication of the volume of resources and teams of the institutions to successful restructuring processes ('turnaround'). I accounted for more than R$ 100 million in numerous audits and projects with highly visible tax incentives, without reservations. The security of my work supports and drives the final goal.
I believe that we generate more value when we combine passion for causes with good management practices. The focus of my work is to promote effective social transformation and contribute to a fairer future.</div>
