# Oct 29 Context Recovery: Member Reconciliation Report

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Task:** Generate comprehensive member reconciliation CSV with intelligent bio quality assessment  
**Status:** In progress - CSV generation complete, bio evaluation pending

---

## FOR THE NAIVE AI READING THIS - START HERE

You are picking up a member reconciliation task. The user wants:

1. A comprehensive CSV showing all Airtable members with bios
2. Cross-referenced against Fathom DB, Google Groups, and Zeffy donations
3. **Intelligent bio quality scores** (not just length) for both Airtable and Fathom bios
4. Detailed evaluation notes in HTML with anchor links

**Your immediate task:** 
- Modify the script to add 3 new columns (publish_status, appeared_in_town_hall, bio_evaluation_link)
- Regenerate the CSV
- Then intelligently read and evaluate ALL bios (514 Airtable + 286 Fathom)
- Create HTML notes with reasoning
- Update CSV with scores and links

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW - BATCHES OF 10:**
1. **Evaluate 10 bios** (read, score, write notes)
2. **Re-read this entire document** to refresh context
3. **Present batch results** to user for feedback
4. **Wait for user approval** before continuing
5. **Repeat** for next batch of 10

**Why batches of 10?** You will lose context over 514 evaluations. Re-reading this document every 10 keeps you calibrated and allows user to provide feedback/corrections.

**The script is:** `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/integration_scripts/member_enrichment/generate_member_reconciliation_report.py`

**The user will eventually ask you to rewrite inferior bios**, so this evaluation work is critical preparation.

Read the full document below for complete context, then proceed.

## What We're Building

A comprehensive CSV report that reconciles **514 Airtable members with bios** across multiple data sources:

1. **Airtable** (people_export.csv) - 514 people with non-empty Bio field
2. **Fathom Database** (fathom_emails.db) - 384 participants with era_member=1 or bio
3. **Google Groups** - Members list (368) and Update list (433)
4. **Zeffy Donations** - 171 payment records (source of truth for donations)

**Goal:** Create a single CSV showing one-to-one-one correspondence across all sources, with intelligent bio quality assessment to identify which bios need rewriting.

---

## The CSV Columns

### Current Columns (Already Generated):
1. **name_airtable** - Name from Airtable
2. **name_database** - Fuzzy matched name from Fathom DB (empty if no match, threshold=80)
3. **match_quality** - Fuzzy match score (0-100)
4. **bio_quality_airtable** - PLACEHOLDER (currently simple length-based, needs intelligent evaluation)
5. **bio_quality_database** - PLACEHOLDER (currently simple length-based, needs intelligent evaluation)
6. **in_google_groups_members** - Yes/No (email match)
7. **in_google_groups_update** - Yes/No (email match)
8. **last_donation_zeffy** - Date of last donation (Zeffy is source of truth, NOT Airtable donor flag)
9. **total_donations_zeffy** - Total $ amount
10. **comments** - Empty for manual notes

### New Columns to Add:
11. **publish_status** - Copy from Airtable "Publish" field
12. **appeared_in_town_hall** - "TH" if appeared in Town Hall, "Other" if other Fathom calls, empty if none
13. **bio_evaluation_link** - Anchor link to detailed notes in bio_evaluation_notes.html

## Bio Quality Assessment (The Intelligence Part)

**Why Intelligence, Not Scripts:**
- "Civil Engineer and Hydrologist" (25 chars) might be perfectly adequate
- A 200-char LinkedIn summary might be terrible if generic
- Length ≠ Quality

**Good ERA Bio Characteristics (from ERA_MEMBERS_LACKING_BIOS_V8.md + Oct 29 Learnings):**
1. ✅ **ERA relevance clearly stated** - Why this person matters to ERA
2. ✅ **Current role & organization** - What they do now, where
3. ✅ **Third-person, professional tone** - Not "I am...", not promotional
4. ✅ **Concise and focused** - 2-4 sentences typical, but can be shorter if complete
5. ✅ **Evidence of competence and expertise** - Specific methods, scale of work, concrete achievements
6. ✅ **Useful details for finding partners** - Technical approaches, areas of expertise, relevant links
7. ❌ **Avoids promotional language** - No "exciting venture", "I'd love to connect", "world-leading"
8. ❌ **Avoids generic LinkedIn speak** - Not copy-paste career summaries

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Evidence vs Marketing (Oct 29 Learning)**

Bios help members find partners with particular areas of expertise. Include relevant evidence, not marketing.

**✅ GOOD - Evidence of Competence:**
- Specific technical approaches: "zero-waste approach, converting by-products into animal feed"
- Scale/scope of work: "accounted for R$ 100 million in audits"
- Concrete methods: "exploring sweet potato leaves for plant-based protein extraction"
- URLs to work: "Climate Landscapes blog at http://climate-landscapes.org"
- Specific achievements that demonstrate expertise

**❌ BAD - Marketing Fluff:**
- Promotional adjectives: "exciting venture", "innovative solutions"
- Self-aggrandizing: "world-leading", "groundbreaking"
- Sales pitches: "I'd love to connect and explore how we can collaborate"
- Vague claims: "significant results", "valuable knowledge"

**The Key Difference:**
- "Converting by-products into animal feed" = Evidence of expertise ✅
- "An exciting venture that could boost opportunities" = Marketing fluff ❌

**Scoring Rubric (0-100):**
- **90-100**: Excellent - All criteria met, ERA relevance clear, professional, concise
- **70-89**: Good - Most criteria met, minor improvements possible
- **50-69**: Adequate - Has basics but missing ERA relevance or too generic
- **30-49**: Poor - Generic, promotional, or missing key information
- **0-29**: Inadequate - Needs complete rewrite

**Examples from Fathom DB (these are GOOD):**
- Rob De Laet: "climate strategist...advocates for water-centered approaches...focuses on hydrological cycle and nature's cooling power" (ERA-relevant, clear role)
- Ilana Milkes: "climate policy consultant based in Panama...previously served as climate change advisor...bringing government experience to restoration initiatives" (role, location, ERA connection)

**What to Evaluate:**
- **Both Airtable AND Fathom bios** (to compare quality between sources)
- **All 514 Airtable bios** (even if no Fathom match)
- **286 Fathom bios** (where matched)

---

## The Workflow (5 Steps)

### Step 1: ✅ COMPLETE - Initial CSV Generated
- Script: `generate_member_reconciliation_report.py`
- Output: `member_reconciliation_report.csv` (514 rows)
- Has placeholder bio quality scores (simple length-based)

### Step 2: IN PROGRESS - Add New Columns
- Add `publish_status` from Airtable
- Add `appeared_in_town_hall` from Fathom DB source_call_title
- Add `bio_evaluation_link` (will point to HTML anchors)

### Step 3: PENDING - Intelligent Bio Evaluation
- Read ALL 514 Airtable bios
- Read ALL 286 matched Fathom bios
- Score each bio 0-100 using rubric above
- Create `bio_evaluation_notes.html` with:
  - Anchor for each person (#person-name)
  - Bio text (both Airtable and Fathom if matched)
  - Score and reasoning
  - Specific issues identified
- Update CSV with intelligent scores and anchor links

### Step 4: PENDING - Present for Review
- Show updated CSV
- Show sample of bio_evaluation_notes.html
- Get user approval

### Step 5: IN PROGRESS - Bio Rewriting (Batch-by-Batch)

**IMPORTANT: Changed to Excel format (Oct 29, 10:49pm)**
- Report file is now `member_reconciliation_report.xlsx` (Excel, not CSV)
- New column: `proposed_rewrites` - contains AI-generated bio rewrites
- User columns preserved: `comments` and `approved`
- AI can read/write Excel files using pandas with openpyxl engine

**Workflow for each batch:**
1. AI evaluates batch of bios (started with 10, now doing 20) → generates HTML with scores
2. User reviews and marks which need rewriting
3. AI researches and rewrites marked bios
4. AI puts proposed rewrites in `proposed_rewrites` column (not comments)
5. AI generates batch HTML (e.g., `oct29_batch_1.html`) with:
   - Original Airtable bio + evaluation
   - Original Fathom bio + evaluation (if exists)
   - **Proposed rewritten bio** + evaluation (showing it meets standards)
5. AI updates CSV: "rewrite bio" → "rewritten"
6. Move to next batch

## Bio Rewriting Workflow - Explicit Steps (Oct 30, 2025)

**CRITICAL: NO SHORTCUTS. This is the ONLY acceptable workflow for bio rewrites.**

### Why This Matters

AI agents often take shortcuts when rewriting bios:
- ❌ Writing bios from existing database text without fresh research
- ❌ "Improving" existing text without checking LinkedIn or transcripts
- ❌ Guessing at context instead of verifying sources

**The result:** Generic, inaccurate bios that don't reflect actual expertise.

### The Proper Workflow (One Member at a Time)

**For each member needing bio rewrite:**

#### 1. Get LinkedIn URL from Fathom Database

```bash
sqlite3 FathomInventory/fathom_emails.db \
  "SELECT name, linkedin_url, bio FROM participants WHERE name = 'Member Name';"
```

**Expected output:** LinkedIn URL (or NULL if missing)

#### 2. Fetch LinkedIn Profile

**2a. Check if already fetched:**
```bash
ls batches/linkedin_profiles/ | grep -i "member-name"
```

**2b. If not fetched, create fetcher script:**
- Copy `linkedin_profile_fetcher.py` pattern
- Update URLs list with member's LinkedIn URL
- Run fetcher (opens browser, fetches profile)
- Profile saved to `batches/linkedin_profiles/[slug].json`

**2c. Read fetched profile:**
```bash
cat batches/linkedin_profiles/[slug].json | jq -r '.extracted.full_text'
```

**Extract key info:**
- Current role and organization
- Professional background (PhD, certifications, etc.)
- Areas of expertise
- Geographic location
- Relevant projects or specializations

#### 3. Search Town Hall Transcripts

```bash
grep -i "Member Name" /Users/admin/ERA_Admin/fathom/output/era_townhalls_complete.md
```

**Look for:**
- Speaking roles or presentations
- Self-introductions
- Project descriptions
- ERA-relevant contributions

**If no mentions:** Note this (silent attendee is okay)

#### 4. Check Other Meetings (If Needed)

**4a. Find all meetings member attended:**
```bash
sqlite3 FathomInventory/fathom_emails.db \
  "SELECT source_call_title, source_call_url FROM participants WHERE name = 'Member Name';"
```

**4b. If meetings are not Town Halls:**
- Note meeting type (ERA Africa, private meeting, etc.)
- May fetch transcript via Fathom API if needed for context
- But LinkedIn + Town Hall should be sufficient for most bios

#### 5. Synthesize Bio from All Sources

**Bio structure (2-4 sentences typical):**

1. **Opening sentence:** Current role and organization
   - Example: "[Name] is [title] at [org] in [location]..."

2. **Middle sentence(s):** Professional background and expertise
   - Include: PhD, certifications, key specializations
   - Focus on ERA-relevant work (water, climate, restoration, etc.)

3. **ERA connection (if applicable):**
   - Town Hall presentations or contributions
   - Projects mentioned in existing bio
   - Collaboration with other ERA members

4. **Closing (optional):** Geographic scope or unique perspective

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Third person (not "I am...")
- ✅ Professional but warm tone
- ✅ Current role included
- ✅ ERA relevance clear (or at least ecosystem restoration relevance)
- ✅ Specific expertise areas (not generic)
- ✅ No promotional language ("exciting", "world-leading", etc.)
- ✅ No age references
- ✅ 2-4 sentences (can be shorter if complete)

#### 6. Update Excel File

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel('member_reconciliation_report.xlsx', engine='openpyxl')

# Update the row
mask = df['name_airtable'].str.strip() == 'Member Name'
df.loc[mask, 'proposed_rewrites'] = "[new bio text]"
df.loc[mask, 'comments'] = 'rewritten'

df.to_excel('member_reconciliation_report.xlsx', index=False, engine='openpyxl')
```

#### 7. Document Research Sources

**When presenting to user, include:**
- LinkedIn profile key facts
- Town Hall mentions (or lack thereof)
- Other meetings attended
- How you synthesized the information

**Example output:**
```
✅ Updated [Member Name]

New bio (XXX chars):
[bio text]

Based on:
  - LinkedIn: [key role], [organization], [expertise]
  - Town Hall: [attendance but no speaking role / presented on X / etc.]
  - Existing bio mentioned: [preserved element like Rob de Laet project]
```

### Example: Thijs Christiaan van Son (Oct 30, 2025)

**Step 1:** Got LinkedIn URL from database
- `https://www.linkedin.com/in/thijsvanson/?originalSubdomain=no`

**Step 2:** Fetched LinkedIn profile
- PhD in Ecology
- Environmental Adviser at Ramboll (Norway)
- Founded Ecofluent AS consultancy
- Expertise: Water resources management, aquatic ecology, geospatial analysis

**Step 3:** Searched Town Hall transcripts
- Attended ERA Town Hall but no speaking mentions

**Step 4:** Checked meeting attendance
- Only one meeting: ERA Town Hall Meeting

**Step 5:** Synthesized bio
- Combined LinkedIn current role + consultancy + expertise
- Preserved existing bio's mention of "Rob de Laet's Cooling the Climate project"
- Made ERA connection explicit (water-centered ecological perspective)

**Original bio (first person, vague):**
> "I'm an aquatic ecologist that is volunteering with the Cooling the Climate project of Rob de Laet and others."

**Rewritten bio (third person, specific, professional):**
> "Thijs Christiaan van Son is an aquatic ecologist and Environmental Adviser at Ramboll in Norway, where he works on water monitoring, biodiversity assessments, and environmental impact studies. He founded Ecofluent AS, a consultancy focused on conserving and sustainably managing water resources. His expertise spans integrated water resources management, geospatial analysis, and ecosystem-based climate adaptation. Thijs contributes to the Cooling the Climate project led by Rob de Laet, bringing his water-centered ecological perspective to climate restoration efforts."

**Step 6:** Updated Excel with proposed_rewrites and marked 'rewritten'

**Step 7:** Documented for user review

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Rewriting without fresh data**
- Don't just rephrase existing bio text
- Must fetch LinkedIn and check transcripts

❌ **Assuming existing bio is accurate**
- Existing bios may be first-person, outdated, or incomplete
- Verify against LinkedIn for current role

❌ **Skipping steps to "save time"**
- Each step provides critical context
- LinkedIn alone ≠ ERA-relevant bio

❌ **Not preserving ERA connections**
- If existing bio mentions projects/people, research and keep them
- Example: Thijs's mention of Rob de Laet was preserved

❌ **Making bios too short or too long**
- 2-4 sentences is typical
- Can be shorter if complete ("Civil Engineer and Hydrologist")
- Should NOT be 10+ sentences (Joe James example)

✅ **What success looks like:**
- Fresh LinkedIn data incorporated
- ERA connection explicit (or ecosystem restoration relevance)
- Professional third-person tone
- Specific expertise areas highlighted
- 2-4 sentences, concise and complete

**After all batches complete:**
- AI reads all `oct29_batch_*.html` files
- AI applies all "proposed" bios to database
- Final verification and summary

## Key Technical Details

### Fuzzy Matching (Airtable → Fathom DB)
- Uses `thefuzz.fuzz.token_sort_ratio()` (handles word order)
- Threshold: 80 (only matches with 80+ score)
- Result: 286/514 (55.6%) matched

### Google Groups Matching
- CSV format: First row is group name, then data starts
- Extract email addresses from first column
- Match by email (case-insensitive)
- Returns: set of lowercase emails

### Zeffy Donations
- Excel file with columns: Payment Date, Total Amount, First Name, Last Name, Email
- Match by email (case-insensitive)
- Aggregate: last donation date + total sum
- **Zeffy is source of truth** (ignore Airtable "Donor Flag")

### Town Hall Detection
- Query Fathom DB: `source_call_title` field
- If contains "Town Hall" → "TH"
- If has other calls but not Town Hall → "Other"
- If no calls → empty

## Important Principles

1. **Zeffy is source of truth for donations** - Ignore Airtable "Donor Flag"
2. **Intelligence over scripts** - Bio quality requires reading and judgment, not just length
3. **One-to-one-one correspondence** - Track which people exist in all three systems (Airtable, Fathom, Zeffy)
4. **Avoid folder clutter** - Single HTML file for notes, not multiple files
5. **Human oversight** - AI evaluates, human reviews and approves
6. **Fathom DB is current source of truth** - Airtable is historical/reference
