            As Founder and Director of Firmrock Agri-Water Initiative, I am committed to driving sustainable agricultural practices that address the core challenges of hunger, water scarcity, and poverty in Kenya's arid and semi-arid regions. Our mission is to empower local communities by providing innovative farming techniques, water management solutions, and value-added agriculture that promote both economic growth and food security. We are currently launching a large-scale cassava and sweet potato farming project, beginning with a 5-acre demonstration hub and training 50 local farmers to replicate this model on their ½-acre plots. This initiative not only focuses on cultivating drought-resistant crops but also incorporates value addition by processing cassava and sweet potatoes into flour and starch. We take a zero-waste approach, converting by-products like pulp and peels into animal feed to ensure resource efficiency. In addition, we are exploring the potential of sweet potato leaves for plant-based protein extraction, an exciting venture that could boost both nutrition and economic opportunities for the community. At Firmrock, our focus extends beyond agriculture. We are tackling the root causes of hunger, water shortages, and poverty by building resilient, self-sustaining communities. We are actively seeking partnerships and resources to scale this initiative and broaden our impact. If you're passionate about sustainable agriculture, innovative solutions, or community empowerment, I'd love to connect and explore how we can collaborate to create lasting change.

            I am a physical geographer and permaculture designer. I have worked for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Geneva from 2000 to 2021, addressing global environmental issues. Linking global interests and goals with local actions, especially in the form of regenerative agriculture inspired by permaculture, is one of my main concerns. I am co-author of the book "Die Humusrevolution" and initiator of the symposium and webinar series "Ressource building Agriculture". I am living in the ecovillage/community Schloss Tempelhof since the end of 2012, where I also help to shape purely practical methods of regenerative agriculture.

            I dedicate my career to expanding the social impact of third sector organizations, aligning the different visions of the areas and actors around a common purpose. I structure resources and operations helping to make each institution more efficient and sustainable. I have worked in strategic positions in some of the main institutions in Brazil, accumulating valuable knowledge along the way. I have achieved significant results in different contexts, ranging from the multiplication of the volume of resources and teams of the institutions to successful restructuring processes ('turnaround'). I accounted for more than R$ 100 million in numerous audits and projects with highly visible tax incentives, without reservations. The security of my work supports and drives the final goal. I believe that we generate more value when we combine passion for causes with good management practices. The focus of my work is to promote effective social transformation and contribute to a fairer future.
