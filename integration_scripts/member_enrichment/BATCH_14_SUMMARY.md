## Key Improvements

### From First Person to Third Person
- **Before:** "I'm an aquatic ecologist that is volunteering..." (Thijs)
- **After:** "Thijs Christiaan van Son is an aquatic ecologist and Environmental Adviser..."

### From Verbose to Concise
- **Before:** 500+ word email signature with contact details (Joe James)
- **After:** 521 char professional bio focusing on CRBBP Process and achievements

### From Generic to Specific
- **Before:** "am an ecologist, forester and conservationist" (Douglas - incomplete sentence)
- **After:** Prof affiliation, Oxford connection, tropical forests, Biotic Pump research

### Added Professional Context
- Organizational affiliations (Ramboll, Wageningen, CIFOR-ICRAF, etc.)
- Geographic locations (Norway, Netherlands, Philippines, etc.)
- Specific expertise areas (water monitoring, urban agroforestry, CRBBP Process)
- Educational credentials (PhD, Yale, Magna Cum Laude)
- ERA connections (board member, project collaborations)
