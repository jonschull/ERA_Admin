# Member Enrichment

**Purpose:** Complete member onboarding by enriching Airtable profiles and preparing for public directory publication

**Status:** üöÄ Active (Oct 25, 2025)

## Overview

### The ERA Onboarding Process

When someone becomes an ERA member (introduced at Town Hall, no objections, week passes):

**Full onboarding should include:**
1. ‚úÖ Update Airtable profile (Bio, email, phone, affiliated organizations)
2. ‚úÖ Publish in public directory (https://www.ecorestorationalliance.org/public-directory)
3. ‚úÖ Add to ERA Landscape visualization
4. ‚úÖ Send welcome email (+ invite to become supporting member)
5. ‚úÖ Add to Google Groups mailing lists

**Reality:** We've been sloppy. There's a backlog.

### Immediate Scope

**This integration focuses on steps 1-2:**
1. **Complete Airtable profiles** for members who attended Town Halls
   - Bios (contextual, personalized)
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers (where available)
   - Affiliated organizations
2. **Prepare for public directory publication** (human activates "Publish" field)

**Current State:**
- Total members: 592
- Has Bio: 509 (86%)
- **No Bio: 83 (14%)** ‚Üê Our target
- Of those without bios:
  - 19 attended Town Halls (have TH context + likely in email)
  - 64 never attended Town Halls (LinkedIn only)

### Future Scope

Steps 3-5 (Landscape, welcome email, Google Groups) will be addressed in future integrations or automation.

## The Challenge

**Hand-authored bios work best** because they:
- Capture what makes each person unique to ERA
- Integrate professional background with ERA engagement
- Reflect actual contributions and interests discussed in Town Halls
- Avoid generic LinkedIn summary language

**Sources of information:**
1. **LinkedIn profiles** (provided by user) ‚Üí Professional background
2. **Town Hall participation** (from Fathom database) ‚Üí Meeting attendance, engagement
3. **Town Hall transcripts** (era_townhalls_complete.md) ‚Üí What they said, context, interests
4. **Email search** (user's email) ‚Üí Contact info (email, phone), affiliated organizations, background
5. **Airtable member data** (existing records) ‚Üí Current affiliations, projects, notes

## Approach: Intelligent Assistant Pattern

Following the participant_reconciliation model:

**Human-AI Collaboration:**
1. AI identifies members needing profiles (prioritized by TH engagement)
2. Human provides LinkedIn URLs for batch of members
3. AI researches each member:
   - Read LinkedIn profile
   - Search Town Hall transcripts for mentions
   - Search user's email for contact info, org affiliations, background
   - Query Fathom database for participation details
4. AI compiles research notes with sources
5. AI drafts complete profile updates:
   - Bio (personalized, contextual - not generic summaries)
   - Email address (from email search or existing data)
   - Phone number (if found in email)
   - Affiliated organizations (from email, LinkedIn, or existing data)
6. Human reviews, edits, approves
7. AI updates Airtable programmatically
8. Human manually activates "Publish" field when ready

**NOT automated profile generation** - This is collaborative curation with AI providing:
- Multi-source synthesis (LinkedIn + TH context + email correspondence)
- Pattern recognition (similar members, common themes)
- Draft generation for human refinement
- Contact info extraction from email

## Key Principles

**1. Context-Rich Bios**
- NOT: Generic LinkedIn summary copy-paste
- YES: "Jane Doe is a marine biologist working on coral reef restoration in the Caribbean. In ERA Town Halls, she has shared insights on..."

**2. Prioritization**
- Town Hall attendees first (we have context)
- Active members over dormant
- Recent participants over historical

**3. Human Oversight**
- AI drafts, human approves every bio
- Human manually activates "Publish" (not automated)
- Batch processing with review cycles

**4. Quality Over Speed**
- Thoughtful, personalized bios
- Multiple source synthesis
- Reflect actual ERA engagement

## Data Sources

**Airtable:** `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/airtable/people_export.csv`
- Fields to update: Name, Bio, Email, Phone, Affiliated Orgs, Publish
- 592 members, 83 need profile enrichment

**Fathom Database:** `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/FathomInventory/fathom_emails.db`
- Town Hall participation records
- 459 validated participants (from participant_reconciliation)

**Town Hall Transcripts:** `/Users/admin/ERA_Admin/fathom/output/era_townhalls_complete.md`
- Complete transcripts of all Town Halls
- Search for mentions, contributions, questions, context

**Email Archive:** (user's email - Gmail search)
- Contact info (email addresses, phone numbers)
- Affiliated organizations mentioned in correspondence
- Background context, introductions, conversations
- **Access via:** Gmail API or search tools (to be determined)

**LinkedIn:** (provided by user)
- Professional background
- Current position, education
- Organizations, skills, interests

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Identify & Prioritize

Generate list of members needing profile enrichment, prioritized by:
1. Town Hall attendance (count of meetings)
2. Member status (active vs historical)
3. Recent engagement

Output: Prioritized list with TH context summary

### Phase 2: LinkedIn Collection

Human provides LinkedIn URLs for batch (e.g., 5-10 members to start)

### Phase 3: Multi-Source Research (AI)

For each member:
1. Read LinkedIn profile (professional background)
2. Query Town Hall participation from Fathom database
3. Search era_townhalls_complete.md for mentions, contributions
4. Search user's email for:
   - Email address
   - Phone number
   - Affiliated organizations
   - Background context, introductions
5. Review existing Airtable data
6. Synthesize into contextual research notes with sources

### Phase 4: Draft Complete Profiles (AI)

Generate complete profile updates:
- **Bio:** 2-3 sentences, personalized
  - Lead with professional background (from LinkedIn)
  - Integrate ERA context (from Town Halls)
  - Highlight contributions/interests
- **Email:** From email search or existing data
- **Phone:** If found in email correspondence
- **Affiliated Orgs:** From email, LinkedIn, or existing data

### Phase 5: Human Review

Present drafts in reviewable format (HTML or CSV)
Human edits, refines, approves each field

### Phase 6: Update Airtable

Programmatically update approved fields:
- Bio
- Email
- Phone
- Affiliated Orgs

Human manually activates "Publish" field when profile is publication-ready

## Success Metrics

**Immediate Goal:**
- Profiles enriched: Target 19 (Town Hall attendees without bios)
- Fields updated: Bio, Email, Phone (where available), Affiliated Orgs
- Quality: Human-reviewed and edited each field
- Context integration: LinkedIn + TH transcripts + email correspondence
- Ready for publication: Profiles complete, awaiting manual "Publish" activation

**Stretch Goal:**
- Additional profiles: 30-50 more (active members, recent participants)
- Full backlog: 83 total needing profiles

**Quality Criteria:**
- Bios are contextual (not generic LinkedIn copy-paste)
- Contact info is accurate and sourced
- Affiliated orgs reflect current/relevant organizations
- Each profile tells the member's ERA story

**Pattern to follow:**
- AI proposes, human disposes
- Batch processing with review cycles
- Evidence-rich outputs (links to sources)
- Learn from corrections

## Relationship to Full Onboarding

**This integration handles:** Steps 1-2 (Airtable profile enrichment + prepare for publication)

**Future integrations will handle:**
- Step 3: ERA Landscape visualization (could be `landscape_sync/`)
- Step 4: Welcome emails (could be `member_communications/`)
- Step 5: Google Groups management (could be `mailing_list_sync/`)

Eventually, the full onboarding workflow should be automated (triggered when someone becomes a member). But for now, we're cleaning up the backlog manually with AI assistance.
