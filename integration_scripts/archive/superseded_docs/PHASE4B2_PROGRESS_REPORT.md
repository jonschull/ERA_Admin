## What Changed: Phase 4B-1 vs 4B-2

### Phase 4B-1 (Completed Oct 19, 2025)
**Focus:** Clear fuzzy matches (≥80% confidence)

- Processed 364 participants automatically
- Required minimal human review
- Straightforward matches only

**Result:** 279 participants remained (too ambiguous for auto-matching)

### Phase 4B-2 (Completed Oct 20, 2025)
**Focus:** Collaborative review of ambiguous cases

- **Interactive HTML tables** with sortable data
- **Gmail integration** for research
- **Custom comment parsing** for complex decisions
- **Batch processing** (25 people per round)
- **Human-AI discussion** for every edge case

**Result:** 255 participants remain (91% reduction from 279 start)

---

## The Process That Emerged

Through 8 rounds, we developed a stable workflow:

### 1. Generation Phase
```bash
python3 generate_batch_data.py          # Select next 25 people
python3 generate_phase4b2_table.py      # Create HTML review interface
```

**Output:** Sortable HTML table with:
- Fathom participant info (name, video links, emails)
- AI-suggested matches from Airtable
- Match confidence scores
- Gmail research capabilities

### 2. Review Phase (Human)
- Open HTML in browser
- Review AI suggestions with Gmail context
- Add comments for decisions:
  - `merge with: Name` - Merge to existing person
  - `drop` - Remove junk entry
  - Custom notes for complex cases
- Export CSV with decisions

### 3. Discussion Phase (Human + AI)
- AI parses CSV with `parse_phase4b2_csv.py`
- Flags custom comments requiring discussion
- Human & AI resolve ambiguous cases together
- Decisions finalized

### 4. Execution Phase (AI)
```bash
python3 execute_roundN_actions.py
```

**Actions:**
- Standard merges (high confidence)
- Custom merges (discussed cases)
- Add new people to Airtable
- Drop junk entries
- Update Fathom database with backups

### Bio Field Issue
**Problem:** Was using Bio field for provenance notes  
**Fix:** Bio now empty, provenance in Provenance field only  
**Impact:** Future additions clean, past additions need manual cleanup if desired
