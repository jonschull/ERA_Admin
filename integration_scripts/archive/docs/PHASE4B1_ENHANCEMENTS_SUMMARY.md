# Phase 4B-1: Enhanced Approval Workflow - Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced HTML Approval Table**
- ✅ Sortable columns (click headers to sort)
- ✅ CSV export button (saves your edits)
- ✅ Filter buttons (show approved/rejected/all)
- ✅ Real-time stats (counts approved/rejected)
- ✅ Terminology guide with recommended comment patterns
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI

### 2. **CSV Parser**
- ✅ Reads exported CSV from HTML table
- ✅ Falls back to HTML parsing if needed
- ✅ Extracts checkbox states and comments

### 3. **Contamination Analysis**
**e-NABLE Meeting Contamination Found:**
- Ian Roy (1 call - e-NABLE only) ❌ REMOVE
- Jason Tothy (1 call - e-NABLE only) ❌ REMOVE
- e-NABLE Events (2 calls - e-NABLE only) ❌ REMOVE

### 4. **"Needs Reunion" Email Draft**
Created: `needs_reunion_email.md` with 4 entries requiring manual contact/merge

---

## Comment Terminology (Recommended)

| Term | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `drop` | Reject this match | Don't process (bad fuzzy match) |
| `Correct Name` | Real name to use | Associate with Airtable entry |
| `email@example.com` | Correct email | Use this email instead |
| `needs reunion` | Multiple accounts | Manual merge required |
| `add to airtable` | New person | Create Airtable entry (Phase 4B-3) |
| `remove from Fathom` | Contamination | Delete from Fathom database |
| `investigate` | Unclear | Manual research needed |

**Comments are free-form** - these are just recommendations!

## Your Review Workflow

1. **Run script:** Generates HTML approval table
2. **Open in browser:** Review matches, click video links
3. **Edit table:**
   - Check/uncheck ☑ boxes
   - Add comments
   - Click column headers to sort
4. **Export to CSV:** Click button at top/bottom
5. **Re-run script:** Provide CSV path
6. **Script processes:** Only approved matches with your comments

---

## Next Run Behavior

When you re-run the script, it will:
1. Generate new HTML (if no CSV provided) OR
2. Parse your CSV (if you provide path)
3. Process ONLY approved matches
4. Include your comments in final report
5. Generate enrichment report with stats

---

## Collaborative Review Process

As you requested:
- You review and approve/reject in HTML
- Export to CSV when done
- **We discuss ambiguous cases together**
- Script runs only after we resolve questions
- Human-in-the-loop, not fully automated
