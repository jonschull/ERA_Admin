# Documentation Navigation Design
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** Design document - Implementation pending  
**Purpose:** Architecture for bidirectional, non-redundant navigation

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Hierarchy = Abstraction Levels

```
Level 0: README.md
         ‚Üì (purpose, audience, quick links)
Level 1: Orientation docs (CONTEXT_RECOVERY, AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE, ERA_ECOSYSTEM_PLAN)
         ‚Üì (current state, role, strategy)
Level 2: Principles & Practices (WORKING_PRINCIPLES, GIT_WORKFLOW)
         ‚Üì (how we work, what we value)
Level 3: Component READMEs (airtable/, FathomInventory/, integration_scripts/)
         ‚Üì (what component does, how to use it)
Level 4: Specialized docs (authentication/, analysis/, specific workflows)
         ‚Üì (detailed how-to, technical specs)
```

**Rule:** Each level can reference UP (to context) and DOWN (to specifics), but **adds information**, never repeats.

### 2. Complementary Content Strategy

**Each level answers different questions:**

| Level | Question Answered | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 0 | What is this entire system? | "ERA Admin integrates 4 data systems" |
| 1 | Where are we now / How do I work here? | "Phase 4B-2 is 87% complete" |
| 2 | What principles guide our work? | "All changes via PRs, not direct to main" |
| 3 | How do I use this component? | "FathomInventory tracks meeting participants" |
| 4 | How do I solve this specific problem? | "To export cookies from browser..." |

**Anti-pattern:** Level 4 doc repeating "ERA Admin is..." (that's Level 0's job)

### 3. Bidirectional Navigation Pattern

**Every document includes:**

```markdown
# Title

**Purpose:** [One line]
**Audience:** [Who reads this]
**Context:** [Link up to parent/broader context]

---

## üìç You Are Here

**Path:** [README](README.md) ‚Üí [Parent Doc] ‚Üí **This Doc**

**Related at this level:**
- [Sibling doc 1] - [Why you'd read it instead]
- [Sibling doc 2] - [Why you'd read it instead]

**Dig deeper:**
- [Child doc 1] - [What it details]
- [Child doc 2] - [What it details]

**Broader context:**
- [Up to parent] - [What it provides]

---

[Content - focused on THIS level's questions]

---

## Next Steps

**If you need to:** [action] ‚Üí **See:** [doc link]

**Back to:** [Parent doc]
```

### 4. Redundancy Rules

**What CAN repeat (stability):**
- Doc title in breadcrumb
- Purpose statement
- Key file paths that define scope

**What MUST NOT repeat (divergence risk):**
- Detailed explanations
- Current status/metrics
- Implementation details
- Historical context

**Strategy:** Link, don't duplicate. Summarize, don't explain.

---

## Document Scope Definitions

**This component:** [One paragraph purpose]

---

## üìç Navigation

**From main system:** [README](../README.md) ‚Üí **This Component**

**Working principles:** See [WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md](../WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md) for:
- Component boundaries
- Testing approach
- Documentation standards

**Within this component:**
- [Subdir/] - [What it contains]
- [Specialized.md] - [What it covers]

**Back to:** [Main README](../README.md)
```

---

- **Clear scope** statement (what this covers, what it doesn't)

**Template:**
```markdown
# Specialized Topic

**Component:** [Component README](../README.md)

---

## üìç Path

[README](../README.md) ‚Üí [Component](../README.md) ‚Üí [Subarea] ‚Üí **This Guide**

**Scope:** This covers [specific topic]. For [related topic] see [other doc].

---

[Detailed content]

---

## Related

**Broader context:** [Component README](../README.md)  
**Related tasks:** [Other specialized doc]  
**Principles applied:** [WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md](../WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md)
```

---

## Special Cases

### Multiple CONTEXT_RECOVERY Files

**Problem:** 3 files with same name, risk of redundancy

**Design:**

**Main (root):**
- System-wide status
- Cross-component work
- Recent major changes

**Component (FathomInventory/):**
```markdown
# FathomInventory - Context Recovery

**See also:** [Main CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md](../CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md) - System-wide status

**This document:** FathomInventory-specific context

---

## üìç Scope

This adds FathomInventory-specific details to the main CONTEXT_RECOVERY.

For system-wide status ‚Üí see [main doc](../CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md)

[FathomInventory-specific content only]
```

**Sub-component (analysis/):**
```markdown
# Analysis Module - Context Recovery

**See:**
- [Main CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md](../CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md) - System status
- [FathomInventory CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md](../CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md) - Component status

**This document:** Analysis module specific context

[Module-specific content only]
```

### Multiple AI Guides

**AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md (general):**
```markdown
## Specialized Workflows

This guide covers general AI workflow patterns.

**For specific tasks:**

### Phase 4B-2 Collaborative Data Review
Complex multi-phase human-AI workflow for data curation.
‚Üí **See:** [integration_scripts/AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](../integration_scripts/participant_reconciliation/archive/superseded_docs/AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

[Provides: 6-phase cycle, mental states, decision trees]
```

**integration_scripts/AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md (specific):**
```markdown
# AI Workflow Guide - Phase 4B-2

**Part of:** [AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md](../AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md) - General AI workflow

**This guide:** Specific workflow for Phase 4B-2 collaborative data review

---

## üìç Context

This is a specialized workflow. For general AI patterns, see [AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md](../AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md).

**Path:** [README](../README.md) ‚Üí [AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE](../AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md) ‚Üí [integration_scripts](README.md) ‚Üí **This Workflow**

[Specific Phase 4B-2 content]
```

- [ ] Add navigation section to README.md
- [ ] Add navigation section to CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md
- [ ] Add navigation section to AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Add bridge between AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE ‚Üî AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE

**Phase 3: Verification**
- [ ] Walk through each navigation path
- [ ] Check for circular references
- [ ] Verify no redundant explanations
- [ ] Test "lost user" scenarios
- [ ] Update NAVIGATION_DESIGN with lessons learned

---

## Testing Navigation

**Scenarios to verify:**

1. **New AI arrives**
   - README ‚Üí AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE ‚Üí WORKING_PRINCIPLES ‚Üí ready
   - Can they find specialized guides when needed?

2. **Working on FathomInventory auth**
   - FathomInventory/authentication/README ‚Üí can they find principles? parent context?

3. **Lost in integration_scripts**
   - Can they get back to main README?
   - Can they find relevant AI guide?

4. **Understanding current state**
   - CONTEXT_RECOVERY ‚Üí can they find component-specific details?
   - Can they avoid redundant explanations?

5. **Following Git workflow**
   - Can they find it from README? From AI guide?
   - Is it linked when needed, not repeated?

---

## Maintenance Rules

1. **When adding new doc:**
   - Determine its level (0-4)
   - Add navigation section following template
   - Link from parent
   - Link to children

2. **When updating content:**
   - Check links still accurate
   - Verify no duplication with parent/child
   - Update "Last updated" date

3. **When archiving doc:**
   - Remove from navigation paths
   - Add pointer in parent to historical location
   - Update CONTEXT_RECOVERY if relevant

---

## Success Criteria

**Good navigation means:**
- ‚úÖ User can always find their way back to README
- ‚úÖ User knows where they are in hierarchy
- ‚úÖ User can find related docs at same level
- ‚úÖ User can drill down for details
- ‚úÖ User can look up for context
- ‚úÖ No content is duplicated across levels
- ‚úÖ Each doc has clear, bounded scope
- ‚úÖ Specialized docs reference principles without repeating them

**Poor navigation looks like:**
- ‚ùå Dead ends (no way back)
- ‚ùå Orphans (not linked from anywhere)
- ‚ùå Circular references (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíA)
- ‚ùå Redundant explanations (same content at multiple levels)
- ‚ùå Unclear scope (don't know if this doc covers X)
- ‚ùå Missing bridges (related docs don't reference each other)

---

**This design should be implemented carefully, testing each path as we go. Not tonight.**
